(Answer \u00b6 2.) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-pleaded the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nto 1.e. Applicant admitted this allegation. (Answer \u00b6 3.) \nApplicant is 67 years old, married since November 1991, and has two grown \nchildren, a daughter 27 and a son 22.

He earned his associate\u2019s degree in 1979 and his bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2004. He served for 20 years on active duty with the U.S, Army until 2004, when he \nretired with an honorable discharge. After serving in the Army, he worked for 19 years in \nvarious positions for defense contractors. He reported one period of unemployment from \nJanuary 2014 to April 2014. Since October 2018, he has been employed by a defense \ncontractor. He currently is working in a country in the Middle East and earns $110,000 \nper year. When he is overseas, he lives on military bases at no charge but pays for his \nown food. (GE 1; Tr. 30-33.) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s employment for one defense contractor, he was sent to the \nPhilippines for training. There he saw all the poor people in certain areas. He considers \nhimself to be a humanitarian. He supports three children through a religious children\u2019s \nfund in the United States. That fund takes care of impoverished families. He donates $60 \nper month to that fund and has done so since 1983. (Tr. 21-22, 45-46.) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 20 years in the Army, he spent nine of them in a country in Asia \n(Country Z). After his Army service, he stayed in that country working for a defense \ncontractor for five years. He met his wife in Country Z, she is a citizen of Country Z, his \nson was born in Country Z, and he retired in Country Z. He saw that poverty was rampant. \nHe said his \u201ceyes woke up.\u201d He decided he \u201cwould like to do something to maybe help.\u201d \nHe \u201cstarted helping people that [he] met.\u201d He asked \u201cam I supposed to run and tell my \nwife every time I do something, even though I have donated considerable amount, I \nguess, to help these ladies that I met, in different areas, in different ways that I met them \nand things like that?\u201d (Tr. 22-24; GE 1.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant testified about his friend who is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.a (Ms. \nAlpha). At the time, he was working in Country Z and took a job about three hours from \nhome. He had an apartment but would go home on weekends. This was in early to mid-\n2007. He met Ms. Alpha during the week in a club where she was working. She worked \n\u201csoliciting drinks from GIs in exchange for sexual favors.\u201d They \u201chad a physical \nrelationship.\u201d   (Tr. 24, 39; Answer \u00b6 1.a; GE 2.)  \nMs. Alpha spoke to Applicant about her family and that she had two children at the \ntime in the Philippines and had to work. She moved to Country Z \u201cso she could work and \nthe only option that she had was working in a club.\u201d He \u201cjust wanted to get to know her \nand just to chat and have a few drinks.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s where my weakness came in that I, \nunfortunately . . . we did have sex, I think, twice.\u201d He testified that he thought \u201cno, this is \nit.\u201d \u201cWe stayed friends, but that was it as far as the sexual activity, which I do regret.\u201d He \nsaid: \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Your Honor, as of right now, and I\u2019m probably going to tell my wife, \nbut that\u2019s 17 years ago, and is that wrong not to tell her? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d (Tr. 25.) \nApplicant ended up working away from home for only a few months and then went \nhome when a job opened up there. Ms. Alpha met a soldier and became pregnant. She \nended up having the baby in Country Z and then went back to the Philippines working \nwith a new baby, two other children, and three different fathers.

He visited Ms. \nAlpha and her children. He finished his training and returned to Country Z. He kept in \ntouch. He told her he did not want this to be permanent, but he wanted her to get some \neducation. He paid for her college education, which was very cheap in the Philippines. \nShe got her teacher certificate and began teaching. He began providing financial support \nin 2009 or 2010 and ended in about 2021 or 2022. (Tr. 27-28, 52.) \nApplicant thought \u201cI can\u2019t be doing this forever and I wanted to cut them off as soon \nas they became self-supportive.\u201d \u201cObviously, so [Ms. Alpha] became self-supportive.\u201d \u201cI \ncut everybody off and I\u2019m like, this is it.\u201d He cut \u201ceverybody\u201d off and has not talked to \nanybody in over a year and a couple of them not for four or five years. By \u201canybody\u201d he \nmeant the women he supported. (Tr. 29-30.) \nApplicant stated that payments to Ms. Alpha were not $600 monthly. He did not \nstart paying $600 a month. It went up and down. The only time he spent that much was \nwhen she was going to college. Then he was paying for college and support for her \nchildren. He confirmed that he first met her in mid-2007 when he was living with his family \nin Country Z. He was stationed a few hours away from his family. They met in a sex bar \nand had sex on two occasions. He denied the interpretation of his personal subject \ninterview (PSI) that he had \u201ca long physical relationship with her.\u201d He was not sure where \nthat came from. (Tr. 38-40.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is not aware of his infidelity. Ms. Alpha has three children. He is \nnot the father of any of those children. A couple of years later, Ms. Alpha returned to the \nPhilippines, and he decided to provide her with some support. (Tr. 40-41.) \nApplicant provided various amounts of financial support to Ms. Alpha. His wife was \nnot aware of that financial support to Ms. Alpha \u201cat that time.\u201d His wife became aware \u201cin \nbits and pieces in the past couple of years.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019d find out about certain things, and she \nwas getting an idea.\u201d About a year ago, he finally \u201copened up\u201d that \u201ca little bit more than \nthis had happened.\u201d His wife was not happy about it and went \u201cballistic.\u201d After a while, his \nwife \u201cgot over it\" and \u201cdidn\u2019t talk about it anymore.\u201d He \u201chad already stopped [the financial \nsupport], so everything is getting better.\u201d (Tr. 41-42.) \nThe security clearance process did not prompt him to have the conversation with \nhis wife. His Answer stated that he communicated with Ms. Alpha about once a month. \nHe denied that. Currently, he does not \u201ccommunicate with anybody.\u201d He \u201cfinally was able \nto cut ties with everybody because he had to . . . [and] wanted to.\u201d He did not use the \nreligious children\u2019s fund to support Ms. Alpha. He never got the impression that Ms. Alpha \nwas duping him. She always sent him receipts. (Tr 42-46.) \nCross-examination established that GE 1 is the most accurate record of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial contributions to Ms. Alpha (and his other friends alleged in SOR \u00b6 1). (Tr. 44-\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) was consistent with his hearing \ntestimony. Ms. Alpha was a Philippine national, and he only visited her once in the \nPhilippines when he was there for training for his employer. During his discussion of Ms. \nAlpha in his PSI, he provided no other information relevant to concerns under Guideline \nB. (GE 2 at 9.) The following passage from the PSI pertains to Ms. Alpha and to \nApplicant\u2019s four other friends who are subjects of the SOR:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n45.) After she had her baby in Country Z, she returned to the Philippines in January 2011. \nThe father was not paying support, so Applicant started paying her $200 a month and \nthen in 2012, 2013, and 2014 increased it to $300 a month. In 2015 to 2018, he paid for \nher college at about $500 a month. In 2018, he increased it to $600 a month to pay for \nsome typhoon damage. She always sent him receipts. He estimated that over about eight \nyears he sent her $40,000. (GE 1 at 48.) \nNone of these foreign nationals has ever served in any foreign \ncountries\u2019 military, government or intelligence services, and would not have \nany knowledge that [Applicant] is currently undergoing a background check \nfor security clearance. \n[Applicant] has never been solicited for information that was \nconsidered classified, sensitive, or proprietary in nature. He claims no \ndeveloped preference or feelings of sympathy, loyalty and/or allegiance to \nany foreign government, interest, individual and/or entity as a result of his \nforeign associations. \n[Applicant] initially acknowledged the fact the [sic] he may be \nsusceptible to blackmail, because he does not want his wife to find out about \nthese women, since it would likely result in marital strife and possible \ndivorce. However, he went on to states [--\nsic] that he loves his country, is \nloyal and would never do anything that would cause harm or damage to his \ncountry, to include divulging classified information to an unauthorized party. \n(GE 2 at 11.)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant testified about his friend who is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.b (Ms. \nBravo). He met Ms. Bravo in an online game in about August 2010. He could not recall \nmuch about the game; it was a chat URL [Uniform Resource Locator]. He met her once \nin person in 2012 when he was in the Philippines for training but had no physical \nrelationship with her. She just showed him around the town.

She then saw a nicer larger club, \nso he helped her with the rent that went from $100 to $300 per month. He saw her being \nproactive and dropped his contribution to $75 per month to $50 and down to zero. He told \nher about that schedule. She showed him all her documents and receipts.

They \nnever met in person. It was a site where one could pay for virtual sex, but they did not do \nthat. He and Ms. Echo stayed friends.

(Tr. 46-47, 69.) \nThe Government conceded that it did not believe there is anything in the record \nthat Applicant\u2019s spouse would use to blackmail him that would jeopardize the national \ninterest if she knew the entirety of his record (including his infidelity). (Tr. 79.) \nApplicant testified about his home mortgage payments, more specifically GE 3 at \n4 (January 2023 credit report), showing his mortgage past due in the amount of $61,778 \n(not alleged in the SOR). He explained that he was in forbearance for almost two years \ndue to COVID. He was unemployed for six months and was unable to make payments. \nHe was not sending monthly payments to his friends overseas. Applicant\u2019s house was \nscheduled to go into foreclosure. He was able to get that fixed and is out of foreclosure \nand is making his monthly payments. (Tr. 67-68.)

(HE 1.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n   Analysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8.

For nine of those twenty years he served in Country Z. \nWhen he began employment with a defense contractor after retirement, he returned to \nCountry Z in 2007. There he became friends with the five women who are the subject of \nthis case. \nApplicant considers himself to be a humanitarian and has supported three \nimpoverished families in the U.S. since 1983 with monthly contributions to a charitable \nfund. During his military service in Country Z, he saw that poverty was rampant. He \ndecided to do something to help. \nNone of the women were residents or citizens of Country Z. Applicant was, \nhowever, working and living there when he made their acquaintance. (\u201cAcquaintance\u201d is \nused, because he never personally met two of the five women.) Four of the five women \nApplicant befriended are citizens and residents of the Philippines (Alpha through Delta). \nEcho was a resident and citizen of the United Kingdom. \nApplicant met Alpha in person a number of times beginning in 2007 in Country Z. \nShe was the only woman with whom he had sex (twice). He reported this in his personal \nsubject interview and his Answer. He provided financial support from 2009 or 2010 to \n2021 or 2022. He paid for her college degree and helped with child expenses. (Applicant \nhas no children with any of these women or with any women other than his spouse.) He \nestimated he sent her $40,000 over eight years. She always sent him receipts. \nApplicant met Bravo online in about August 2010. He met her twice in person in \n2012, when he was in the Philippines for training, but they had no physical relationship \nwith her. She just showed him around the town. he provided about $11,000 in support to \nBravo. She always sent him receipts. He finally ended her support in about 2022. \nApplicant met Charlie and provided about $8,500 in support from February 2014 \nto January 2020. He never met her in person and has not spoken to her in years. He \nprovided support for medical expenses and for her small business.

He helped her achieve that dream and estimated he sent her a total of $4,000. \nHis support ended in about 2016 or 2017. She always sent him receipts. \nApplicant met Echo (a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom) on a website in \n2012. They never met in person. It was a site where one could pay for virtual sex, but \nthey did not do that. He provided financial support, \u201cbecause she looked like she needed \na little support.\u201d He provided Echo about a total of $3,400 from about November 2012 to \nDecember 2013. She always sent him receipts. \nThese friendships were carried on for over twenty years virtually, that is, via email, \nwebsites, in chat rooms, gaming sites, and other electronic means. There were very few \nin-person meetings. None of Applicant\u2019s financial support was provided in-person. There \nis no evidence that any of the online sites used exclusively portrayed sex, sexuality, \npornography, or any other nefarious scenarios. Those sites that could have been used \nfor those purposes were not so used by him or his friends. He provided about $66,900 in \nsupport to these friends from about 2010 to 2022. He has ceased communicating with \nthose friends and providing any financial support. His spouse now knows about his past \nfinancial support but not the total amount he paid. He has not disclosed to his spouse his \nsexual relations with Alpha in 2007. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) apply in part to Applicant\u2019s female \nrelationships, because they can be deemed \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cforeign persons.\u201d \nThere is no evidence that any of Applicant\u2019s foreign friends has ever served \nin the Philippines\u2019 or any other foreign countries\u2019 military, government, or intelligence \nservices. They would not have any knowledge that he is currently undergoing a \nbackground check for security clearance. He has never been solicited by these friends \nfor information that was considered classified, sensitive, or proprietary in nature. He \nclaims no developed preference or feelings of sympathy, loyalty and/or allegiance to the \nPhilippines or any other foreign government, interest, individual and/or entity as a result \nof his foreign friends. There is no evidence that his financial support to his foreign friends \ncreated a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, or a conflict of interest between his \nobligation to protect classified information and his desire to help one or more of his friends. \nIn addition, in light of the nature of his relationships with these foreign friends, it is unlikely \nthat he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. The \nremainder of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) does not apply and, in any event, it is mitigated by AG \u00b6 \n8(a). I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior  \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

Moreover, although not pleaded in the SOR, there is no \nevidence of any behavior that is criminal, compulsive, caused him to be vulnerable, or \npublic in nature. There is no evidence that the women duped him or made demands on \nhim of any sort. On the contrary, the record shows that his financial assistance was \ncompletely voluntary and was supported by receipts. I find that the Government has not \nestablished a case under SOR \u00b6 2.a. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s sexual relations with Alpha is deemed to have \ntriggered AG \u00b6 13(c), his conduct is mitigated. The sexual conduct happened in 2007, 17 \nyears ago. That conduct occurred twice. He has ceased communications with and any \nfinancial assistance to Alpha. Any basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress is speculative \nand has long since evaporated. The Government does not believe his spouse would use \nhis infidelity to jeopardize national security.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-pleaded the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nto 1.e. For the reasons set forth under the Guideline B discussion, I find in favor of \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 3. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that the security concerns under \nGuideline B, foreign influence, Guideline D, sexual behavior, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, have been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n    Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 e.:  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nFor Applicant   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 b.: \n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n                 Subparagraph 3.a.: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(Tr. 31-39, 57-65)  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions.

I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his military service. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F arising out of his delinquent debts. This \ndecision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not \nattain the state of reform necessary for eligibility for access to classified information in the \nfuture. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline H.

On \nDecember 16, 2022, the parties agreed to schedule Applicant\u2019s hearing on February 21, \n2023.

I advised him that Applicant \nhad three options for submission of her case for my decision: (1) submit the file, including \ntranscript and exhibits, with no additional evidence; (2) submit the file, including transcript \nand exhibits, and add additional documentation; and (3) have a new hearing, which would \ninclude the existing file with transcript and exhibits. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 6) Applicant \nelected option two, and on November 4, 2024, her counsel submitted one exhibit, which \nwas admitted into evidence.

(Tr. 35) She did not experience these symptoms at work. \n(Tr. 35) She received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder. (Tr. 36) She was prescribed \nmedications; however, the side effects made their use impractical or ineffective. (Tr. 23-\n25, 48)  \nApplicant\u2019s therapist recommended that she try medicinal marijuana. (Tr. 23) A \nphysician prescribed cannabis oil for Applicant. (Tr. 23) With the support of her physician, \nApplicant applied for and received a certification from the state for medicinal marijuana \nuse on October 26, 2020. (Tr. 25-26; AE A) She received medicinal marijuana from a \nmedical dispensary in the state where she is a resident. (Tr. 26) The bottles of marijuana \nfrom the medical dispensary had prescription labels on them. (Tr. 27) She is required to \nrenew her marijuana prescription annually, and she sees her physician for her marijuana \nprescription on at least an annual basis. (Tr. 40) \nIn her August 27, 2021 SCA Applicant said, \u201cI use cannabis and cannabis oil \neveryday as prescribed by my doctor to help with anxiety.\u201d (GE 1) According to her SCA, \nshe used cannabis from December 2020 to July 2021. Id. In her October 22, 2021 Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant said she \nuses cannabis \u201ca couple of times a week, as prescribed by her doctor to help with anxiety \nand to prevent panic attacks. [She] currently has a medical marijuana card and [uses \nmarijuana] as needed at home. [She] began use on 12/2020 and usage continues to \npresent.\u201d (GE 2 at 2) \nAt her hearing, Applicant said she uses marijuana \u201cas needed.\u201d (Tr. 27) She uses \nIndica marijuana two or three times a week before going to bed, and Sativa marijuana \nwhen she is not working during the day, such as on weekends. (Tr. 27-28, 53-54) Indica \nmarijuana enables her to relax and helps her sleep. (Tr. 29) Sativa marijuana provides an \n\u201cuplifting effect.\u201d (Tr. 41) After December 2020, she inhaled marijuana using a vape; she \nhas never used marijuana recreationally; and she used it at home. (Tr. 28, 41) She has \nnever gone to work while under the influence of marijuana. (Tr. 29) Marijuana use has \nnever affected her work. (Tr. 32) She did not have any adverse side effects from using \nmarijuana. (Tr. 31) Maintenance of her security clearance is more important to her than \ncontinuing to use marijuana. (Tr. 32, 42-43) \nThe marijuana oil Applicant uses has a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of 10 \nto 18 percent. (Tr. 42) At her hearing, she said she stopped using marijuana and THC oil \nin July 2022. (Tr. 45, 50, 53) She renewed her marijuana card in case the federal policy \nagainst marijuana use changes. (Tr. 46) Her employer has a policy concerning marijuana \nuse; however, she was unaware of whether her employer\u2019s policy specifically prohibited \nmedical marijuana use. (Tr. 54, 58) Her rationale for not informing her employer of her \nmarijuana use was that it was after duty hours and medicinal. (Tr. 54) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used THC with varying frequency from about \nDecember 2020 to present.

(Tr. 36, 56-57, 60, 62) Applicant \nsaid that after the summer of 2022, she did not intend to use marijuana in the future.

(Tr. 62)  \nOn November 4, 2024, Applicant\u2019s Counsel said that after her hearing on February \n21, 2023, Applicant made important changes in her life. (AE F) He said: \n[Applicant] stopped using medical marijuana in early 2024 and does not \nintend to use medical marijuana going forward. She made a conscious and \ndedicated effort to find other ways to manage her anxiety, including \nmeditation, exercise, gardening and use of over the counter medications \ninstead of medical marijuana. Part of her current medication regimen is the \nuse of over the counter hemp/CBD products, however, none of those \nproducts contain THC or are otherwise comparable to marijuana. \n[Applicant\u2019s] commitment to this change is demonstrated by declining to \nrenew her medical marijuana card . . . . Moreover, she moved to [another \nstate] in March 2024 and medical marijuana is not legal in [her new state of \nresidence]. By relocating to a state without legalized medical marijuana . . . \n[Applicant] has demonstrated a sincere and long-term commitment to this \nnew treatment plan for her anxiety. She continues to be employed by [her \nDOD contractor-employer] in the same position and continues to receive \noutstanding performance reviews for her work. (AE F) \nIn the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, some members of the Senate \nand House of Representatives proposed removing cannabis from the Controlled \nSubstances Act in states that have chosen to legalize medical cannabis. (AE B) If \nenacted, it would also remove some restrictions on cannabis use for federal employees. \nId. This bill would also likely trigger a reduction in restrictions on cannabis use for DOD \ncontractors. \nCharacter Evidence \nA coworker who has worked with Applicant for five years lauded her diligence, \nenthusiasm, and strong moral character. (AE D) Applicant is knowledgeable, ethical, \ndedicated, mature, and committed to her work. Id. A federal employee who has worked \nwith her for four years praised Applicant\u2019s responsibility, trustworthiness, and \nconscientious compliance with security rules.

The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established \nbecause it is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s position when she used THC was a \u201csensitive \nposition\u201d as contemplated in the Directive. She did not explicitly indicate she used \nmarijuana while having access to classified information. Additional discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nPossession of Schedules I, II, and III controlled substances is a federal criminal \noffense (Schedule III substances may be possessed with a lawful prescription). Schedules \nI, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance.  \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana or THC from December 2020 to early \n2024. Sometimes her use was three times a week, and sometimes she did not use \nmarijuana for several months. Her decisions to repeatedly possess and use marijuana, \nespecially after her hearing, are an indication she lacks the qualities expected of those \nwith access to national secrets. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. She voluntarily and \ncandidly disclosed her cannabis use on her SCA, in her OPM PSI, in her SOR response, \nduring her hearing, and in her post-hearing exhibit. Her statements throughout the security \nclearance process have been credible and consistent. She expressed her intention not to \nuse cannabis in the future. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Based on medical advice, Applicant \ndecided that using cannabis would be beneficial and therapeutic. While cannabis use by \nfederal and non-federal employees has some support in the Congress, the Executive \nBranch and Congress may not approve future cannabis or marijuana use for security \nclearance holders or for those employees holding sensitive positions. In any event, \nsecurity clearance decisions are based on the laws as they exist in the present. \nApplicant might conclude in the future that resumption of her use of cannabis is \nnecessary for her health or for other reasons. Use of cannabis raises concerns about her \njudgment in the context of safeguarding classified information. \nI am not convinced Applicant\u2019s cannabis use \u201chappened under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur [and] does not cast doubt on [her] current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d A concern remains that she will continue to use \nmarijuana in the future.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old cyber security engineer or lead who has worked for \ndefense contractors for more than six years. In 2003, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin information systems technology or business administration. She worked for various \ncontractors from 2004 to present, and she held a security clearance since 2005. The only \nsecurity issue relates to her medicinal use of marijuana.  \nApplicant was honest and candid in her descriptions of her use of marijuana. She \nprovided two written character statements. Their statements support her access to \nclassified information. \nThe evidence against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is more \npersuasive. Applicant used cannabis, sometimes about three times a week, from \nDecember 2020 to early 2024 for medical reasons. She also stopped using cannabis \nbefore her hearing, and then she resumed cannabis use after her hearing. Her decisions \nto repeatedly possess and use cannabis, which is illegal under federal law, are an \nindication she lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and denied SOR \u00b6 1.d with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 45 years old. He is married and has two children. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 2010. Since January 2011, he has been consistently employed in various full-time positions. He has been with his current, sponsoring employer since January 2023. He has not previously held a security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 9, 19-22) The SOR alleges two private student loans totaling about $45,500 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); a federal tax debt of $4,568 for tax year (TY) 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and that Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax return for TY 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The allegations are established by his admissions, his responses to interrogatories, and by various credit reports and IRS account transcripts. (GX 1-5; AX C-D) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($13,004) and 1.b ($32,464) are two of four private student loans that Applicant cosigned for his then-girlfriend, now his wife, to attend nursing school in 2008 and 2009. The loans became due in 2012 and she began making timely payments of $600 per month. They married in 2013.

Department Counsel offered into evidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5. Applicant objected to GX 4, a credit report, over \nconcerns regarding its accuracy and reliability. I overruled that objection and admitted \nGX 1 through GX 5. Applicant testified and offered one document, Applicant Exhibit \n(AX) A, which I admitted without objection. I held the record open until December 1, \n2023, to allow both parties the opportunity to submit additional documents. Applicant \ntimely submitted an e-mailed narrative statement and five documents that I marked as \nAX B through AX G and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 21, 2023. The record closed on December 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and denied SOR \u00b6 1.d with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He is married and has two children. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 2010. \nSince January 2011, he has been consistently employed in various full-time positions. \nHe has been with his current, sponsoring employer since January 2023. He has not \npreviously held a security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 9, 19-22) \nThe SOR alleges two private student loans totaling about $45,500 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b); a federal tax debt of $4,568 for tax year (TY) 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and that \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal tax return for TY 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The \nallegations are established by his admissions, his responses to interrogatories, and by \nvarious credit reports and IRS account transcripts. (GX 1-5; AX C-D) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($13,004) and 1.b ($32,464) are two of four private student loans \nthat Applicant cosigned for his then-girlfriend, now his wife, to attend nursing school in \n2008 and 2009. The loans became due in 2012 and she began making timely payments \nof $600 per month. They married in 2013. (GX 1-3; Tr. 24-28) \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s wife became pregnant and eventually stopped working for \nseveral months. Applicant claimed that, during this time, he was unaware that she \nstopped paying on two of the loans. In 2016, the creditor began calling Applicant, but he \ninitially refused to answer because he believed the loans were being paid by his wife \nand he had no other accounts with the creditor. (GX 1-3; Tr. 25-32) \nFinally, by early 2017, Applicant communicated with the creditor and learned that \nthe two loans were behind. He testified that he applied for a resumption of payments at \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na reduced rate based on economic hardship. This request was denied. He then claimed \nto have offered a $3,000 payment from his emergency savings to bring the loans \ncurrent. The creditor informed him that the two loans had been charged off and that a \npayment would not change their status. Applicant believed the delinquent loans would \ntransfer to a collection agency and waited for someone to contact him. He further \nclaimed that no one ever reached out for payment. (GX 1-2; Tr. 26-30, 52-55) \nApplicant testified that his wife never stopped paying on the two loans that \nremained in good standing with the original creditor. In 2018, he researched his financial \noptions online and called the creditor quarterly to see if he could resolve the charged-off \nloans or pay to have the negative reporting of the loans be removed from his credit \nreports. He testified that the creditor took no action in response. (GX 2; Tr. 33-35, \n52-59) \nWith the birth of his second child in 2019, Applicant testified that he took a break \nfrom contacting the creditor about the charged-off loans. He resumed his efforts in 2020 \nand claimed his wife submitted an application to consolidate the loans. During the \napplication process, only the two active loans, and not the two charged-off loans, \nappeared in her paperwork. For unknown reasons, his wife did not qualify for any loan \nconsolidation. Payments on the two loans in good standing continued. (GX 1-2; Tr. 33, \n53-56, 62-65) \nIn 2021, Applicant\u2019s work transitioned to governmental services, and he knew \nthat the charged-off loans could be a concern in a background investigation. He testified \nthat, during this period, he contacted the creditor and asked to be removed from the \nloan as a cosigner. He also claimed to have offered $10,000 to settle the debt. In both \ninstances, Applicant claimed that the creditor refused to act as the loans had been \ncharged off. (GX 2; Tr. 57-60) \nApplicant disclosed the loans in his September 2021 SCA and claimed he was \nattempting to set up a payment plan with the creditor. During his October 2021 interview \nwith a background investigator, he clarified that he made additional attempts to contact \nthe creditor to negotiate the removal of the charged-off loans from his credit report. \nDuring this period, he learned from the creditor that the two loans in good standing were \nbeing transferred to another lender. He hoped the new lender would be able to provide \nsome information on the charged-off loans. (GX 1-2; Tr. 31-34, 62-65) \nIn early 2023, the original creditor transferred the two remaining loans to a new \ncreditor. Applicant testified that he and his wife continue to make timely payments on \nthose loans and estimates the combined balance to be about $40,000. He testified that \nhe also inquired with the new creditor as to the status of the charged-off loans. \nHowever, he was informed that the new creditor did not have the loans and he was \nreferred back to the original creditor. (GX 2; Tr. 28-34, 62-64) \nAt hearing, Applicant admitted that he never received an IRS Form 1099-\nCancellation of Debt or any documentation from the original creditor indicating that the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloans were closed.

(GX 5; Tr. 30, 48-49) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted correspondence from the original creditor, \ndated December 2023, regarding the two charged-off loans. It stated that \u201cdue to the \nage of your debt, we will no longer attempt to collect from you\u201d and that no additional \npayments on the loans were required. Applicant also submitted a budget that reflected \ncontinued payments on three student loans. He did not specify whether these were \npayments on any of his wife\u2019s student loans or his own student loans that remained in \ngood standing. This budget also showed that Applicant maintained a net monthly \nremainder, after expenses and retirement contributions, of about $4,800. (AX B, E-G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant owed $4,568 in past-due taxes for TY 2016. At \nhearing, Applicant admitted that he previously owed past-due taxes for TY 2016 and \nexplained that he experienced increased income that year and insufficient funds were \nwithheld by his employer. Applicant also described experiencing financial and marital \nissues during this time and admitted he was slow to address the problem, but that the \ntax return had since been filed and the taxes paid. (GX 1-2; Tr. 43-45) \nPost-hearing documentation included an IRS account transcript for TY 2016. It \nshows that Applicant filed the return in April 2018, and was assessed penalties for the \nlate filing and late payment. He made periodic payments between 2019 and January \n2023. The TY 2016 taxes have now been paid. (AX C) \nAn IRS account transcript for TY 2017 reflects that Applicant filed this return in \nMay 2018 and received a penalty for the late filing and late payment. Beyond the initial \nwithholding, Applicant made payments in 2019 and 2020 toward this tax debt, which \nhas now been paid. (GX 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his TY 2018 return. At \nhearing, Applicant provided documentation reflecting that he attempted to file this return \nlate, in 2020. However, he forgot to sign the return and it was rejected by the IRS. At \nthat time, Applicant also had a job offer fall through and moved his family twice in one \nyear. He admitted he forgot about resubmitting the tax return, but said that it had since \nbeen filed and paid. An IRS account transcript reflects that he refiled his TY 2018 return \nin January 2023 and received penalties for the late filing and late payment. In May \n2023, Applicant issued a payment to the IRS for $6,179, part of which resolved his \nremaining balance for TY 2018. (GX 1-2; AX A-B, D; Tr. 35-39) \nApplicant timely filed his TY 2019 return. A $723 credit was transferred to pay \nunspecified taxes owed for TY 2015. Similarly, Applicant timely filed his TY 2020 return \nand received a refund. However, $5,158 was credited towards his past-due taxes owed \nfor TYs 2015 and 2016.

At hearing, Applicant testified \nthat he had since filed the return and owed no additional taxes for that year, but did not \nprovide an updated IRS account transcript or other documentary evidence in support of \nthis assertion. (GX 2; Tr. 39-40) \nApplicant testified that he filed his TY 2022 return early, but owed between \n$9,000 and $10,000 in additional taxes. This was because of a miscalculation involving \nhis wife\u2019s income and several months of insufficient withholdings by her employer. To \naddress this tax debt, Applicant claimed that he submitted multiple payments to the IRS \nin 2023 from $500 to $1,000 and that the back taxes would be paid by the end of 2023. \nHis budget included a $500 monthly payment for taxes. (AX G; Tr. 39-42) \nApplicant testified that, in the last two years, his financial situation had \nsignificantly improved, and he was now financially stable and maintaining his monthly \nexpenditures as well as an emergency fund. He also followed general financial advice \nonline and used a web-based budgeting system that allowed him to closely monitor the \nfamily budget. Beyond the two charged-off student loans, he testified that he has no \nadditional delinquent debts. This is supported by his November 2023 credit report. (GX \n5; AX G; Tr. 45-46) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

All of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are several pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s wife became pregnant and eventually stopped working. \nApplicant described experiencing financial and marital issues during this period. While \nhe initially hesitated to communicate with the creditor, once he learned that two of his \nwife\u2019s student loans were not being paid, Applicant took action and attempted to \nnegotiate a payment plan. He was informed that the loans were charged off and that no \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \npayment was due. Still, he described continued efforts that he and his wife took to \nattempt to resolve the loans over the following years. Finally, in December 2023, he \nreceived documentation from the creditor stating that, given the age of the debt, the \nloans were closed. \nOutside of this debt and his tax issues, Applicant has no other financial issues. \nHis budget and credit report show that he has taken significant steps to strengthen the \nmarital finances and meet his ongoing financial obligations. This debt under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. Over time, Applicant took responsible actions \nto address the loans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b) are applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) is partially applicable based on his use of online financial advice and a web-based \nbudgeting system. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s tax situation is less settled. Although Applicant faced \nadditional challenges in 2016 that complicated his tax filing, he failed to file for an \nextension and did not file the return until April 2018. Even with the submission of his \nSCA in September 2021 and his awareness that his financial situation would be under \nreview, he still waited until January 2023 to complete paying the taxes for TY 2016. \nSimilarly, the IRS did not receive Applicant\u2019s TY 2018 return until January 2023, and his \nTY 2018 past-due taxes were not resolved until May 2023. \nWhile difficulty in meeting financial obligations may force an applicant to choose \nthe order in which he or she addresses unpaid debts, they do not provide a plausible \nexcuse for failing to meet an important legal requirement, such as filing returns when \ndue. ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017) Failure to file tax returns \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem complying with well-established governmental \nrules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002) \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s tax concerns were not isolated to TY 2016 and TY 2018.\nHis TY 2019 and TY 2020 IRS account transcripts show credit transferred out to pay \ntaxes for TY 2015. He also received a penalty for a late filing and late payment for TY \n2017. As of June 2022, an IRS transcript showed that his TY 2021 return had not been \nfiled and no extension had been requested. Applicant testified that his TY 2021 return \nhad since been filed. Even if that were established, that return would be late. He also \ntestified that he still owed, and was paying, taxes for TY 2022. These additional years of \ntax issues were not alleged in the SOR. However, they establish a history of non-\ncompliance with tax obligations that undercut assertions of mitigation, since his tax \nproblems are recent and ongoing.\n \n \nThe Appeal Board has stated that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, this does not preclude careful \nconsideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing a \n\u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s \nwell that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation). \nAlthough Applicant has since paid his TY 2016 debt and filed his TY 2018 return, \nnone of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are fully applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c or 1.d. His \ndifficulties in meeting his federal tax obligations are long-standing and continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or established \nthat he will be able to maintain compliance with his ongoing tax obligations. \nAfter experiencing some financial difficulties in 2015, Applicant is credited with \ntaking responsible action to communicate with the creditor regarding his wife\u2019s student \nloans and making multiple attempts over the years to resolve those debts. However, \nthose efforts do not fully mitigate the ongoing financial security concerns arising from his \nfederal tax issues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nFollowing financial difficulties in 2015, Applicant continued to communicate with \nthe creditor regarding his wife\u2019s private student loans and took reasonable actions over \ntime to attempt to resolve the debt, which is now closed. He also researched and \nengaged tools to better budget and manage the marital finances. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nHowever, Applicant was less diligent in meeting his tax obligations. Although he \nresolved his tax issues for TY 2016 and TY 2018 in 2023, he failed to establish a track \nrecord of tax compliance. At the time of the hearing, he continued to have outstanding \npast-due tax debt. His struggles to meet this annual obligation raises unmitigated \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the \npleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He married in 2008 and divorced in 2023. He has two \nchildren, one of whom is a minor. He attended college from 2014-2019 and has earned \nabout 80 credits, but has not yet earned a degree. He served in the Navy from 1999-2003 \nand received an honorable discharge. He has worked for a defense contractor since \n2010, and works as a test engineer. (Tr. 14-16; GE 1). \nIn 2018, Applicant\u2019s wife, who worked as a nurse, became addicted to prescription \nmedication. He did not realize the extent of her drug problem until she left him at the start \nof the COVID-19 pandemic and started living out of her car. During their marriage, they \nheld a joint checking account and she took responsibility for paying their bills and \nmaintaining their day-to-day finances. He discovered before she left that she was using \nthe money in their joint account to buy herself jewelry, trips, and other items, and at times \ndid not make payments on their bills. He asserted that they could easily afford their \nmonthly expenses on only one of their salaries. He stated that he still could not account \nfor some of her spending. (Tr. 18-52; AE A, B). \nAfter she left him, Applicant realized that his household had financial delinquencies \nthat he needed to resolve. During this time, he was also dealing with his children who had \ntrauma from their mother leaving and from the COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that he \ndid the best that he could at the time. (Answer; Tr. 18-52; GE 2, 3, 4). \nThe SOR alleges ten student loans in collection totaling about $52,000, a past due \nauto loan totaling $9,038, and four medical debts totaling $4,254. The status of the \nallegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j are ten student loans in collection totaling about $52,000. After \ntaking a break from college in 2019, Applicant had a temporary deferment on his student \nloans. He intended to restart school before the deferment ended. The problems with his \nmarriage required him to take a break and focus on their relationship. He did not realize \nthat these loans became due and delinquent prior to the start of the national COVID-19 \nstudent loan deferment. Since his wife was handling the finances, he never saw or \nreceived notice that loan payments became due. After she left him in early 2020, he did \nnot receive communication from the lender about his student loans. (Tr. 18-52; GE 2, 3, \n4, 5, 7). \nIn about September 2020, Applicant received notice from his facility security officer \n(FSO) that delinquent student loans had been found on his credit report in the continuous \nevaluation security process. He immediately reached out to the Department of Education \n(DOE) about establishing a payment plan on the loans.

(Tr. 18-52; GE 2, 3, 4, 7). \nApplicant reported that his mother passed away in late 2021 and left him about \n$90,000. He intended to immediately use a portion of this money to make a lump sum \npayment to resolve his student loans. He also considered liquidating part of his retirement \naccount to resolve the debt. However, his divorce attorney advised him against doing \neither option at the time, because it would impact the divorce proceedings with his ex-\nwife. Once issues in that ligation were resolved, he made a lump sum payment to the \nDOE in 2022. He stated that he thought this payment was made prior to receiving the \nSOR. These student loans are resolved. (Answer, Tr. 18-52; GE 2, 3, 4, 7). \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a past due auto loan with a balance of $9,038. This loan was for \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s car. After she left him, she was living in the car. Since she was \nhandling her car payments all along, this loan went unpaid. The lender eventually \nrepossessed the vehicle, and it was sold at auction. The lender used the proceeds from \nthe sale to settle the balance and sent Applicant a check for $3,643, which were the \nremaining proceeds from the sale. He provided supporting documentation with his \nAnswer. The account number on the check matches a significant portion of the account \nnumber on the credit report. While this debt still appears on his credit report, it is in error. \nThis debt is resolved. (Answer, Tr. 18-52; GE 2, 3, 4, 7). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-1.m are medical debts in collection for $4,125. Applicant reported that \nhe was unsure of the origin of these debts. He asserted that they had health insurance \nand that he never saw any medical bills. He provided documentation with his Answer \nshowing that he paid these medical debts in June 2022. These debts are resolved. \n(Answer, Tr. 18-52; GE 2, 3, 4, 7). \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a medical debt in collection for $92.

(Tr. 18-52; AE D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has resolved all of the debts except \u00b6 1.o. This debt is a $37 medical \ndebt in which the creditor cannot be determined, and it does not present a security \nconcern. The evidence and testimony in this case clearly demonstrate that the financial \nconsideration security concerns occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, and does \nnot cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. He \nprovided sufficient evidence to show that he has acted responsibly and has undertaken \ngood-faith efforts to repay his creditors and resolve his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and \n20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his military service, and his service to the government \nworking for a defense contractor. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nI had the chance to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and assess his credibility. The \ninformation he provided was thorough, he adequately explained the circumstances \nsurrounding the SOR allegations, and I found his testimony and explanations to be \ncredible and substantially corroborated by documentary evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant timely answered the SOR \nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on December 13, 2022. The \nhearing was held on May 23, 2023, by use of Microsoft TEAMS video teleconference. \nThe record was held open until July 28, 2023, to afford the Applicant an opportunity to \nsubmit additional post-hearing evidence. After reviewing the transcript and evidence, I \nproposed to the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Both parties had ten days to consider the matter and to provide \nwritten notice of their objections. Neither party objected. \nIn summary, this case centers on significant debt that Applicant and his wife \nincurred after they became the adoptive parents of their young niece and nephew after \nState A removed them from a mentally and physically abusive environment and placed \nthem in foster care. Applicant and his wife willingly accepted the responsibility of raising \nthese children and were granted complete custody in April 2015. \nAt the time Applicant and his wife were approached by State A to become the \nadoptive parents of these children, Applicant was and remains employed as a senior \nSharePoint Specialist at an overseas military installation. The significant debt Applicant \nand his wife incurred included, but was not limited to, hefty legal costs, international \ntravel, preparing their home for a home study, cribs, clothing, diapers, food, costs of \nmoving to a larger home, and uncovered medical expenses. And when the children \nbecame of school age, Applicant was required to pay $24,000 a year per child for their \neducation at their local DoD school. \nApplicant has made a determined and measured effort to pay off his SOR debts. \nHe enrolled in a debt consolidation program and sought financial counseling. He \nproduced mitigating evidence during his hearing and post-hearing demonstrating that he \nhas paid, settled, or otherwise resolved all of his SOR debts. In furtherance of his \ncommitment to regain financial responsibility, Applicant continued to pay off his two \nremaining debts post-hearing immediately after having open heart surgery. \nApplicant has worked for his defense contractor employer since 2020 and holds \na Top Secret clearance. He has successfully held a clearance for 22 years and has an \nexcellent work record. He submitted a budget that reflects that he leads a modest \nlifestyle and lives within his means. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that Department Counsel \npresented sufficient evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR under Guideline \nF. I also conclude that Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts admitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel. In particular, \nI conclude that the security concerns are resolved under the following mitigating \nconditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).  \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nand considered whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence \nor vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. This case is decided for Applicant. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n3 \n",

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and \ndetailed reasons why the DCSA CAS adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a statement, dated September 15, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR, and \nhe requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Government was prepared \nto proceed on December 19, 2022. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2023. A \nNotice of Microsoft TEAMS Video Teleconference Hearing was issued on February 21, \n2024, scheduling the hearing for March 7, 2024. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and GE 2, and \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through AE F were admitted into evidence without objection. \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on March 18, 2024. I kept the record open to enable the \nparties to supplement it with additional evidence. Applicant took advantage of that \nopportunity and timely submitted six documents, including an updated Response to the \nSOR, which were admitted as AE G through AE L without objection. The record closed \non March 26, 2024. \nRulings on Procedure \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take Administrative Notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan), appearing in extracts \nof 15 written submissions issued by various U.S. Government sources. Facts are proper \nfor Administrative Notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source and \nrelevant and material to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on source \ninformation regarding Kyrgyzstan in publications of the Department of State, the \nDepartment of the Treasury, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, and the Commander, U.S. Central Command. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n10, 2004)); and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 \n(3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is \nto notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, \nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts \nfor administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g., Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 \n(2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents).   \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below \nunder the Foreign Influence Section, found in the Kyrgyzstan subsection. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with substantial comments, all the \nSOR allegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). The \ninformation in his Answer to the SOR is incorporated herein. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nBackground \nApplicant is a 47-year-old Jamaican-born naturalized U.S. citizen. He came to the \nUnited States as a child with his parents in 1980 and became a U.S. citizen in June 2001, \nrelinquishing his Jamaican citizenship. He is an employee of a defense contractor and has \nbeen serving as a subject matter technical expert in Ecuador since November 2022. He \npreviously worked for other employers as a senior commercial solution for classified \narchitect (September 2015 \u2013 October 2022); a senior wireless engineer (January 2009 \u2013 \nSeptember 2015); senior wireless engineer (January 2009 \u2013 September 2015); a senior \nmobile communications specialist (January 2008 \u2013 January 2009); and a senior \nconfiguration management specialist (July 2003 \u2013 December 2007). (AE K) His \nemployment locations were in Kuwait, Afghanistan, Iraq, Oman, Jordan, Germany, and \nEcuador. (Tr. at 29-30) A 1996 high school graduate, he received an associate degree \nin electrical communications. (Tr. at 6) He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in July 1996 and \nserved on active duty until July 2003, when he was honorably discharged. He was granted \na U.S. security clearance and has held either top secret - with access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) - or secret clearances since 1998. He was married in \n2000 and divorced in 2020. He married again in 2021. He has six daughters. \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \nDuring his military service Applicant was awarded the following military awards and \ndecorations: the Air Force Achievement Medal (with one cluster), the Joint Service \nAchievement Medal, the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, the Air Force \nLongevity Service Award, the National Defense Service Medal, the NCO Professional \nMilitary Education Ribbon, the Combat Readiness Medal (with one cluster), the Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award, and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award. (AE I) \nForeign Influence \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents, and his brother, are Jamaican-born naturalized U.S. \ncitizens residing in the United States. His sister is a Jamaican-born citizen residing with their \nparents in the United States as a Permanent Resident. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife \u2013 a dual citizen of Ecuador and the United States \u2013 resides with their \nthree children -- also dual citizens -- in Ecuador. Their citizenship and residency are of no \nsecurity significance to the Government. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.: Applicant\u2019s wife was born, raised, and educated in Kyrgyzstan. She \nreceived a Bachelor of Economics and Finance specializing in credit banking at a Kyrgyz \nuniversity. She was considered a third-county national (TCN) employee of the Army & Air \nForce Exchange Service (AAFES) at a U.S. facility in Afghanistan when he met her in \n2012 during her one-year contract assignment. Before getting that job, she underwent an \nextensive background investigation, and upon being hired she was subject to weekly \nrandom searches and inspections for one year. Although she owned a residence in \nKyrgyzstan that her mother previously purchased, and it was worth about $32,000 (AE \nF), in about May 2018, she semi-relocated to Kuwait where she worked at a beauty salon \nand was travelling back and forth between the two countries. Applicant and his wife were \nmarried in 2021, and she resided in Kuwait with him since that time. When he relocated \nto Ecuador in October 2022, she joined him, and they both currently reside there, as legal \npermanent Ecuadorian residents, with their two children, including one that was born in \n2023. Applicant indicated that his wife\u2019s property in Kyrgyzstan was sold, and she no \nlonger has any financial ties or bank accounts in Kyrgyzstan. (Tr. at 20-24, 51) \nShortly after they were married, Applicant applied for a Petition for Alien Relative \n(Form I-130) with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as well as an \nApplication for Action on an Approved Application or Petition (Form I-824). The petitions \nwere received by the U.S. Department of State National Visa Center, and he was notified \nthat the case is being processed. (AE B; AE D; AE G) When approval is received, she \nintends to apply for U.S. citizenship. (AE L) She has never been affiliated with the \nKyrgyzstan government, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or \nintelligence service. (Response to SOR at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a minor child, born in Kyrgyzstan, from a previous marriage, \nand who was previously residing with her grandmother there even though Applicant\u2019s wife \nwas working in Kuwait part of the time. Since Applicant\u2019s marriage to the child\u2019s mother, \nand their relocation to Ecuador, the child has resided with them, and Applicant has legally \nadopted her. Applicant submitted separate petitions for the child. (AE C; AE E; AE G) The \nchild\u2019s citizenship and residency are of no security significance to the Government. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother \u2013 Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law \u2013 is a citizen and \nresident of Kyrgyzstan. She is a seamstress for a small clothing factory most of each \nweek but spends increasingly more time tending to her garden in her home in a small \nvillage near Bishkek. While Applicant\u2019s wife communicates with her mother frequently via \nWhatsApp, because his mother-in-law does not speak English, Applicant and his mother-\nin-law do not communicate with each other. (Tr. at 52) She has never been affiliated with \nthe Kyrgyzstan government, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or \nintelligence service. (Response to SOR at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.: Applicant previously had an intimate relationship with a woman who \nwas a citizen and resident of Kyrgyzstan working in Afghanistan at a U.S. military facility, \nand in 2015 they had a child. When Applicant\u2019s work took him to Kuwait in 2018, she and \nthe child moved back to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan where they currently reside. The woman is \nemployed as a social media content specialist.

(Tr. at 36-37) She has never been \naffiliated with the Kyrgyzstan government, military, security, defense industry, foreign \nmovement, or intelligence service. (Response to SOR at 3) \nKyrgyzstan \nThe Kyrgyz Republic (or Kyrgyzstan) is a landlocked, mountainous Central Asian \ncountry that was formally annexed by the Russian Empire in 1876. A major revolt against \nthe Tsarist Empire in 1916 resulted in almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population being \nkilled. It became a Soviet republic in 1926. It achieved independence on August 31, 1991, \nwhen the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics dissolved. Predominantly rural and Muslim, \nthe country has a population of over 7 million, of which over 77% are native Kyrgyz. \nInitially a parliamentary republic, it was governed by an elected president as head of state; \nby an appointed prime minister as head of the government; and by a Supreme Council of \n120 seats. The president holds substantial powers even though the prime minister \noversees the Kyrgyz government and selects most cabinet members. The president \nrepresents the country internationally and can sign or veto laws, call for new elections, \nand nominate Supreme Court judges, cabinet members for posts related to security or \ndefense, and numerous other high-level positions. \nNationwide protests because of violations in parliamentary elections led to the \noverthrow of the country\u2019s first president (Askar Akaev) in March 2005. Under a new \npresident (Kurmanbek Bakiev) elected in July 2005, Kyrgyzstan made tangible progress \ntowards meeting international standards. The country\u2019s human rights record improved \nconsiderably, although limitations on due process and other human rights problems \npersisted. Following a week of opposition-led street protests, the country adopted a new \nconstitution on November 9, 2006, which provided for greater checks and balances \namong the branches of government. On December 30, 2006, the parliament adopted a \nrevised version of the constitution that restored many powers to the president but also a \ngreater role for political parties. \nOn April 7, 2010, Kyrgyzstan had a violent change of government and approved a \nnew constitution and a temporary president (Roza Otunbaeva) in a June 27 national \nreferendum. October 10, 2010, parliamentary elections were generally free and fair, and \nAlmazbek Atambaev was sworn in as president in 2011. On October 15, 2017, former \nprime minister and ruling Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan member Sooronbay \nJeenbekov was elected to succeed outgoing President Atambaev, who became the first \nKyrgyz president to step down after serving one full six-year term as required in the \ncountry\u2019s constitution. Kyrgyzstan's 2017 presidential election marked the first peaceful \ntransfer of presidential power from one democratically elected president to another in \npost-Soviet Central Asia. It was the most competitive in the country\u2019s history, although \ninternational and local election observers noted cases of vote buying and misuse of public \nresources. Prime minister Abyl-Gaziev took office on April 20, 2018. In October 2020, \nprotests against legislative election results spread across the country, leading \nto \nPresident Jeenbekov\u2019s resignation and catapulting the previously imprisoned Sadyr \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nJaparov to acting president. In January 2021, Japarov was formally elected president, \nand a referendum to move the country from a parliamentary to a presidential system was \napproved. \nFollowing independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly implemented market reforms, such \nas improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was \nthe first Commonwealth of Independent States country to be accepted into the World \nTrade Organization. The government has privatized much of its ownership shares in \npublic enterprises. Significant impediments to Kyrgyzstan's development include endemic \ncorruption, aging infrastructure, high unemployment, and endemic poverty. \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with Kyrgyzstan on December \n25, 1991, following the country\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union. The United States \nsupports Kyrgyzstan in its development of an inclusive democracy based upon the rule \nof law and respect for human rights. U.S. Government assistance goals in Kyrgyzstan are \nto strengthen democratic institutions, support broad-based economic opportunity, \nenhance regional security, promote greater respect for human rights and the rule of law, \nand address development challenges in health and education. Kyrgyzstan and the United \nStates belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United \nNations, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. \nKyrgyzstan also is a participant in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) \nPartnership for Peace program. Kyrgyzstan and the United States have a bilateral trade \nagreement. Kyrgyzstan also signed a trade and investment framework agreement with \nthe United States and other Central Asian countries establishing a regional forum for \naddressing trade issues and enhancing trade and investment between the United States \nand Central Asia. \nManas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, which had served as a transit and logistics base \nfor U.S. troops heading to Afghanistan, was turned over to the Kyrgyz military in June \n2014 after Kyrgyz\u2019s parliament passed legislation to end the U.S.\u2019 lease on the base. As \nof February 2018, the U.S. Defense Department was concerned about Russian influence \nin Central Asia and Kyrgyzstan\u2019s increasing alliance with Russia and China. \nAt a hearing before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee held on February \n27, 2018, the Commander of the U.S. Central Command stated, in part: \nThe Kyrgyz Republic has increasingly aligned its interests with Russia and \nChina. The U.S.-Kyrgyz security relationship has declined since the closure \nof the Manas Transit Center and the termination of the bilateral Defense \nCooperation Agreement in 2014. Despite the Kyrgyz armed forces\u2019 desire \nto improve military-to-military cooperation with CENTCOM, Kyrgyz senior \ncivilian leaders have shown little interest in improving military relations. \nKyrgyzstan\u2019s counterterrorism efforts continue to concentrate on rooting out \n\u201cterrorists\u201d and preventing those from returning from conflicts abroad from engaging in \nterrorist activities, by bolstering reintegration and rehabilitation efforts.

Ethnic, political, and socio-economic tensions continue to simmer in Kyrgyzstan. \nKyrgyzstan remained vulnerable to transnational threats, especially in the remote south. \nThe U.S. Embassy reviews travel of Embassy employees to Batken Oblast because ill-\ndefined and porous borders allow for the relatively free movement of people and illicit \ngoods, rendering the region vulnerable to transnational threats and could facilitate the \nestablishment of terrorist safe havens. Rugged terrain and a lack of resources prevent \nauthorities from adequately controlling the borders. Lack of economic opportunity was \nidentified as a significant driver of violent extremism in the country, which forces a large \nportion of the population to seek employment opportunities in Russia, where they are \nparticularly susceptible to recruitment. According to government statistics, some 850 \nKyrgyz citizens have left the country to join ISIS or other terrorist groups, but the true \nnumber is likely higher. The government faces limitations on its ability to investigate, \nprosecute, and rehabilitate returning foreign terrorist fighters because of a lack of \nexpertise, resources, and potential shortcomings in the legal framework. \nAreas along the Kyrgyz-Uzbek and Kyrgyz-Tajik borders continue to have small, \nbut sometimes violent and deadly, skirmishes between border guards on both sides, \nwhich have affected civilians. These skirmishes often result from land use disputes. \nOrganized crime related to smuggling and narcotics trafficking are widespread in the \nsouthern corridors of Kyrgyzstan. Due to the exit of Coalition Forces from Afghanistan in \n2014, the Kyrgyz government is concerned that terrorist and extremist groups may move \nnorth into Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. \nAs of June 2022, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security \nassessed Bishkek as a low-threat location for crime and political violence and as a \nmedium-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. government \ninterests. U.S. citizens visiting the country have been robbed by groups of young men \nwho followed them back to their residences from hotels and bars. In addition, U.S. citizens \nhave been victims of rape, assault, sexual harassment and kidnapping. Attackers do not \nalways avoid violent confrontation with their victims. Harassment and extortion by people \nwho purport to be Kyrgyz police officers has happened in local markets and in areas \nfrequented by Westerners. Even so, the State Department\u2019s travel advisory to Kyrgyzstan \nwas Level I: Exercise Normal Precautions. \nSignificant human rights issues persisted in Kyrgyzstan involving law enforcement \nand security services officers\u2019 use of torture and arbitrary arrest; increasing pressure on \nindependent media; harassment of journalists; selective and politically motivated \nprosecutions; pervasive corruption; forced labor; and attacks, threats, and systematic \npolice-driven extortion of sexual and ethnic minority groups. Official impunity was a \nsignificant problem. While authorities investigated reports of official abuse in the security \nservices and elsewhere, they rarely prosecuted and punished officials accused of human \nrights violations, or complicity in trafficking. While the law provides for an independent \njudiciary, judges were subject to influence or corruption. Throughout the year there were \nmultiple instances where the conduct and outcomes of trials appeared predetermined. \nNumerous sources, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), attorneys, \ngovernment officials, and private citizens, asserted judges paid bribes to attain their \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions. Many attorneys asserted that bribe taking was ubiquitous among judges. \nAuthorities generally respected court orders. Numerous NGOs described pervasive \nviolations of the right to a fair trial, including coerced confessions, use of torture, denial of \naccess to counsel, and convictions in the absence of sufficiently conclusive evidence or \ndespite exculpatory evidence. International observers reported threats and acts of \nviolence against defendants and defense attorneys within and outside the courtroom, as \nwell as intimidation of trial judges by victims\u2019 relatives and friends. Law enforcement \nofficers, particularly in the southern part of the country, frequently employed arbitrary \narrest, torture, and the threat of criminal prosecution as a means of extorting cash \npayments from citizens. \nKyrgyz law provides for freedom of expression, including for members of the press, \nand citizens generally were free to exercise these rights. Self-censorship was prevalent, \nand some journalists reported pressure from editors and political figures to bias their \nreporting on sensitive topics. Some journalists reported intimidation related to coverage \nof sensitive topics, such as inter-ethnic relations, \u201creligious extremism,\u201d or the rise of \nnationalism. In recent years there were attempts to proscribe independent media from \noperating freely in the country. Tight government controls over news content on state \ntelevision was widely acknowledged. The Kyrgyz government failed to enforce laws \nagainst rape effectively, and rape cases were underreported. Police generally regarded \nspousal rape as an administrative, rather than a criminal, offense. While the law \nspecifically prohibits domestic violence and spousal abuse, violence against women and \ngirls remained a significant yet underreported problem. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n7: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, an ex-girlfriend, and one child (the child of Applicant and \nhis ex-girlfriend) are residents of Kyrgyzstan. The child is a dual U.S. \u2013 Kyrgyzstan citizen \nand the others are Kyrgyzstan citizens. His wife is a Kyrgyzstan citizen residing in \nEcuador with Applicant, and their two children, awaiting the naturalization process to \nproceed to enable her to eventually become a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nmother-in-law, ex-girlfriend, and his child are manifestations of his or his wife\u2019s care and \nconcern for relatives residing in Kyrgyzstan. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility.

May 23, 2018)). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an Applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nDecember 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nApplicant\u2019s continuing relationship with his child and his child\u2019s mother, as well as his \nwife\u2019s continuing relationship with her mother are the current concerns for the \nGovernment. However, the security significance of these identified concerns requires \nfurther examination of those relationships and financial interests to determine the degree \nof \u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an Applicant\u2019s relatives \nor friends in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors, including the \ntotality of an Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the realistic potential for \nexploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the foreign power in \nquestion, including the government and entities controlled by the government, within the \nrelevant foreign country. Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is limited to countries that are \nhostile to the United States. In fact, we must avoid reliance on overly simplistic distinctions \nbetween \u201cfriendly\u201d nations and \u201chostile\u201d nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline \nB. \nThe nature of the foreign government involved, and the intelligence-gathering \nhistory of that government are among the important considerations that provide context \nfor the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another important \nconsideration. Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood \nthat an Applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government \ncoercion or inducement. Nevertheless, as noted above, the U.S. State Department\u2019s \nBureau of Diplomatic Security assessed Bishkek as a low-threat location for crime and \npolitical violence and as a medium-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or \naffecting official U.S. government interests. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law, \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists \ncause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to \nconduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of \nKyrgyzstan with the United States, the situation in Kyrgyzstan, including crime and \nterrorism, place a burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith any family member or friend living in Kyrgyzstan does not pose a security risk. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist relatives or a friend living in \nKyrgyzstan. \nThere are criminal and terrorist groups active in Kyrgyzstan; increased levels of \nterrorism, violence, and insurgency; and human rights problems in Kyrgyzstan that \ndemonstrate that a heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present due to \nApplicant\u2019s ties to his family and a friend. However, that risk is not generated by the \nKyrgyzstan government, but by criminals and terrorists striking out against the central \nKyrgyzstan authorities and foreigners. Applicant\u2019s family members and his friend residing \nin Kyrgyzstan are potential targets in this war on civilized society and humanity. The \npresence of criminal and terrorist groups and increased levels of terrorism, violence, and \ninsurgency in Kyrgyzstan have also been described concerning events occurring on 9-\n11, and more recently in Fort Hood, Boston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, San Bernardino, and \nNew York City. However, as noted above, based on their relationships, there is a \npotential, but greatly reduced, \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security \nclearance.  \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in Kyrgyzstan seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family members or his friend, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out \nsuch a possibility in the future, especially since the Russian\u2019s and Communist Chinese \nare becoming more active in the country. International criminal and terrorist groups are \nknown to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state intelligence \nservices, and Kyrgyzstan has a significant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s \nfamily members and his friend in Kyrgyzstan could be a means through which Applicant \ncomes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \npotentially attempt to exert coercion upon him. \nI am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and \nundivided and he has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., \nthat he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. In this instance, because of his background, the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \npotential conflict of interest is dramatically reduced to nearly zero. Nevertheless, because \nof the evidence related to his family and a friend in Kyrgyzstan, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) \nhave been established. Further inquiry is appropriate to determine potential application \nof any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists some conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such \nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States;  \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  \nAs indicated above, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, his ex-girlfriend, and his child \n(whose mother is the ex-girlfriend), are all citizen-residents of Kyrgyzstan, although his \nchild is a dual U.S. \u2013 Kyrgyzstan citizen. While Applicant\u2019s wife communicates with her \nmother frequently via WhatsApp, because his mother-in-law does not speak English, \nApplicant and his mother-in-law do not communicate with each other. Applicant furnishes \nhis ex-girlfriend $600 per month as financial support through a separate debit card that \nhe gave her several years ago. He occasionally communicates with her and their child \nthrough WhatsApp messages (three times in 2024; eight or nine times in 2023), \nspecifically on the child\u2019s birthday, New Year\u2019s Day, or in a dire emergency. His wife \nresides with him in Ecuador, and she has no further financial interests in Kyrgyzstan. \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or more frequently \nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent.) Frequency of contact is not the sole determinant of foreign interest security \nconcerns based on connections to family. \u201c[I]nfrequency of contact is not necessarily \nenough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his \nor her own immediate family as well as his or her spouse\u2019s immediate family.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). Applicant cares for his family. \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He has significant connections to the United States \nwhere his parents have resided for over four decades. He and his family followed the U.S. \nimmigration rules and waited in Jamaica before coming to the United States legally, not \nby ignoring the laws and joining the masses of undocumented individuals who came \nacross the border without proper authority. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for \nabout 23 years. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force, and since the end of his \nmilitary service in 2003, he was worked on behalf of the U.S. Government in a variety of \noverseas locations, including some that were considered combat zones. His wife and \nyoungest child reside with him in Ecuador as permanent residents awaiting naturalization \nas U.S. citizens. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s wife, mother-in-law or ex-girlfriend are or \nhave ever been political activists, challenging the policies of the Kyrgyzstan government; \nthat criminals or terrorists have approached or threatened them for any reason; that the \nKyrgyzstan government or any criminal or terrorist organization have approached them; \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \nor that they currently engage in activities that would bring attention to themselves. As \nsuch, there is a reduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation \nby the Kyrgyzstan government or the terrorists, which may seek to quiet those who speak \nout against them. Under these circumstances, the potential heightened risk created by \ntheir residence in Kyrgyzstan is greatly diminished. Under the developed evidence, it is \nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates. \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 relationship with and historical \ninvestments in Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan was and is an important U.S. ally in combatting \nterrorism. The United States leased the Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, which had served \nas a transit and logistics base for U.S. troops heading to Afghanistan. The sole \ndestabilizing factor in the U.S. \u2013 Kyrgyzstan relationship is the Russian attempt to \nincrease its powers over the former Soviet Republic and diminish U.S. influence in the \narea. Applicant has met his burden of showing there is little likelihood that relationships \nwith his mother-in-law, ex-girlfriend, and child could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nI am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and \nundivided, and that he has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S. that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) have been established and they fully mitigate foreign \ninfluence security concerns under Guideline B.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant proffered substantial \nmitigating evidence, which was more than sufficient to overcome the disqualifying \nconditions established under Guideline B. \nLargely due to the balance between Russia\u2019s imperialistic motivations and \nKyrgyzstan reluctance to returning to be a Russian province, after many decades of a \nvolatile relationship between Russia and Kyrgyzstan, changes have occurred in the \nrelationships between Kyrgyzstan and the United States and Russia. Kyrgyzstan has \nincreasingly aligned its interests with Russia and China, and the U.S.-Kyrgyzstan security \nrelationship has declined since the closure of the Manas Air Base and the termination of \nthe bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement. Nevertheless, the Kyrgyzstan armed \nforces desire to improve military-to-military cooperation with CENTCOM, but Kyrgyzstan \nsenior civilian leaders have shown little interest in improving military relations. However, \non the local level, Bishkek \u2013 the home of Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, his ex-girlfriend, and \nhis child \u2013 has been assessed as a low-threat location for crime and political violence and \nas a medium-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. \ngovernment interests. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and youngest child are permanent Ecuadorian residents residing \nwith him awaiting U.S. naturalization. Applicant has met his burden of showing there is \nlittle likelihood that relationships with his wife, mother-in-law, ex-girlfriend, and child could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nalleged foreign influence concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He married a citizen of The Gambia in September 2020. \nHis wife is working with an immigration attorney to apply for legal resident status after her \noriginal visa expired. They do not live together and keep their finances completely \nseparate. Applicant has no children. He earned a high school diploma in June 2010 and \na Certificate of Completion from a two-year trade school program in July 2015. He began \nhis current employment as an aviation maintenance technician with a major defense \ncontractor in August 2018.

(GE 1; GE 2; GE 4; Tr. 26-29, 31-34.) \nOn February 5, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for national security eligibility that he needed \nto move into a position involving access to classified information. His work for the defense \ncontractor up to that point had comprised only commercial projects that did not involve \naccess to sensitive or classified information His Facility Security Office (FSO) required \nhim to submit the 2021 e-QIP to clarify or renew his eligibility because it had been more \nthan four years since he left the Marine Corps and was involved with any duties requiring \na clearance. Applicant\u2019s belief that his previous security clearance was no longer active \nin any way was affirmed by his interactions with his managers and the FSO. (GE 1; GE \n4; Tr. 26-29, 35-36, 41-44, 65-66.) \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to the question in Section 23 \nof his February 2021 e-QIP that asked, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally \nused any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes \ninjecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any \ndrug or controlled substance.\u201d He was still regularly using marijuana at the time.

He further confirmed in response to \ninterrogatory questions that he had used marijuana several times per month from about \nAugust 2018 to May 2021, which he knew to be in violation of his employer\u2019s no-drug-use \npolicy. During the July interview, he admitted his knowing illegal use of marijuana, as well \nas his intentional concealment of this conduct from his employer and on his 2021 e-QIP \nin order to avoid known potential adverse consequences. These facts were also \nconfirmed by his hearing testimony. (GE 2; Tr. 44, 49-50, 52-56.) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing testimony was forthright and credible. The evidence in this \ncase strongly confirms that he was not employed in a national security sensitive position \nand had no access to classified information during his 2018-2021 period of marijuana \nuse. It further establishes that he had neither knowledge nor reason to believe that he \npossessed a security clearance at the time. (Tr. 8-9, 27-29, 34-36, 41-44, 65-66.) \nAs noted above Applicant admitted that he knew he was violating employer\u2019s \nwritten no-drug-use policy to which he had agreed. He was subject to pre-employment, \nrandom, and potential incident-related urinalysis testing during his assignments to work \non some projects. (GE 3; Tr. 44-53, 57.) \nApplicant submitted no documentary evidence in extenuation or mitigation of the \nsecurity concerns raised by his conduct, after acknowledging his opportunity to do so \nwhile the record remained open after his hearing. He testified that he has substituted a \nhealthy routine of physical activities as his preferred alternative to marijuana use for \nrecreation and stress reduction. (Tr. 54-55, 57-63, 67-69.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying based on the SOR allegations in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admittedly used marijuana on a regular basis from about August 2018 to \nMay 2021. He knew that his marijuana use was illegal under Federal law and violated his \ncompany\u2019s employee substance abuse policies. The record evidence establishes that he \nwas neither granted access to classified information nor holding a national security \nsensitive position during the period at issue. This establishes security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 25(a) but negates any concerns under AG \u00b6 25(f). Accordingly, the burden to mitigate \nthe established concerns shifts to Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides two conditions that could mitigate the drug-related security \nconcerns raised in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021. \nIn her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have legalized or \ndecriminalized the use of marijuana. She reaffirmed the 2014 SecEA memorandum \nregarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of \nmarijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal \nmarijuana policy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance \nadjudications, \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns \nraised by his or her past use of marijuana. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his regular recreational \nmarijuana use from about August 2018 through May 2021. He knew that his drug \ninvolvement was illegal under Federal law and contrary to his employer\u2019s safety and \nsecurity policies, yet it continued until at least three months after he submitted his e-QIP \nseeking to obtain national security eligibility. He claimed to have no intention to abuse \ndrugs in the future, and to have only used the marijuana at home by himself. However, \nonly his statements support these assertions, which were not corroborated by any \nevidence from those who work with or otherwise know him. His admitted history of drug \nabuse ended less than two years before his personal appearance hearing, and only when \nhe knew that he would soon undergo an OPM background investigation. \nThis evidence does not sufficiently establish that drug abuse is unlikely to recur, \nand it casts continuing doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. Substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) was not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified his 2021 e-QIP concerning his regular use of \nmarijuana since 2018, because he knew it to have been illegal under Federal law and \nviolative of his employer\u2019s no-drug-use policy for employees. He sought to avoid \nsignificant risks to his potential for continued employment with the defense contractor, as \nwell as his ability to obtain national security eligibility to open new opportunities there. He \nadmits that he intended to conceal this drug involvement because, at the time, it was an \nongoing course of conduct, and he knew that it would negatively affect his personal and \nprofessional standing. He honestly denied that this drug use occurred while possessing \na security clearance because he actually and reasonably believed that his previous \nclearance had lapsed. The record evidence clearly establishes \u201cspecial interest\u201d security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(a), 16(e), and 16(f). \nAG \u00b6 17 includes three conditions that could mitigate the security concern arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant provided insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the \nforegoing conditions. He finally admitted the falsification in July 2021 when asked to \nconfirm its truth during his OPM interview, but this was neither a prompt nor a good faith \neffort to correct the concealment of drug use that he had attempted to continue for the \npreceding five months. This was not the type of \u201cpositive step\u201d that would demonstrate \ntrustworthiness or significantly reduce vulnerability. Applicant\u2019s falsification and \nconcealment were not minor offenses. They occurred over a recent three-year period, \nand under circumstances that were not unique. He engaged in purposeful deception \nconcerning information that he knew to have security significance, in pursuit of his \nperceived self-interest. This recent conduct casts continuing doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment, despite his subsequent admissions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nintentionally attempted to conceal his ongoing drug abuse, failing to demonstrate either \nrehabilitation or accountability for his misuse of marijuana before and during the time he \nwas working for a defense contractor and after applying for a security clearance. He failed \nto convincingly demonstrate his intention to abstain from further substance misuse. He \nprovided insufficient evidence to demonstrate his trustworthiness, responsibility, and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. The potential for pressure, exploitation, \nor duress remains undiminished. \nOverall, the evidence creates significant doubt as to Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising under the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and the \nPersonal Conduct guidelines. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.

He has worked in the defense industry since about 2015. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since 2002 when he was an active-duty Marine. He joined the military after the 9/11 attacks. His military occupational specialty (MOS) involved computer administration. He deployed for a year to a combat zone. He was discharged honorably in December 2014. He has a associate\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2018. He is married and has two middle school aged children.

In his Answer he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which are cross alleged under Guidelines M (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and E (SOR \u00b6 3.e), that he used his company computer to view pornography and resigned in lieu of being fired. He testified that while working at the IT help desk, as the system administrator, he used his company computer to view pornography while at the worksite. He cited working at a site where all the employees were working from home because of COVID and the possibility of catching COVID because of having to come into work as the reason for his decision to look at pornography on his work computer.

The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 16, 2023, scheduling \nthe hearing for November 7, 2023. The Government amended the SOR on November 1, \n2023. After confirming Applicant had sufficient notice and was prepared to proceed the \nhearing was convened as scheduled. (Tr. at 7.) Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called a witness, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. \n1 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant's Answer contained a number of administrative documents, AE A through AE \nC had been assigned different letters by Applicant's counsel. (Tr. 17, 19.) The record \nremained open until November 21, 2023. Applicant timely submitted two exhibits ((AE D \nemployee evaluation) and (AE E Military Awards)), which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript on November 22, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 39-year-old information technology (IT) project manager employed \nby a defense contractor since June 2022. He has worked in the defense industry since \nabout 2015. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since 2002 when \nhe was an active-duty Marine. He joined the military after the 9/11 attacks. His military \noccupational specialty (MOS) involved computer administration. He deployed for a year \nto a combat zone. He was discharged honorably in December 2014. He has a associate\u2019s \ndegree, which was awarded in 2018. He is married and has two middle school aged \nchildren. (Tr. at 23-25; GE 1 at 12, 31-32, 38.) \nApplicant is an admitted sex addict, whose addiction is to pornography. In his \nAnswer he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which are cross alleged under Guidelines M \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) and E (SOR \u00b6 3.e), that he used his company computer to view pornography \nand resigned in lieu of being fired. He testified that while working at the IT help desk, as \nthe system administrator, he used his company computer to view pornography while at \nthe worksite. He cited working at a site where all the employees were working from home \nbecause of COVID and the possibility of catching COVID because of having to come into \nwork as the reason for his decision to look at pornography on his work computer. (Tr. at \n28.) He estimated he spent \u201cfour to five hours, maybe more\u201d viewing pornography at work \nduring his eight-hour workday. (Tr. at 52.) As a result, in September 2020 he was fired by \nhis employer for viewing pornographic material on his company computer. He \nacknowledged he knew it was a violation of rules, procedures, and regulations. (Tr. at 55, \n76.) He admitted he did not want to disclose during the security clearance eligibility \nprocess his viewing pornography at work, the misuse of his government computer, or \nlosing his job because of viewing pornography because he knew that it would be \nproblematic for his security clearance. (Tr. at 81-82.) He did list on his February 2021 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he had been caught viewing \npornography at work, which resulted in him relinquishing his government issued computer \nand access card and being escorted off the installation. (GE 1; Tr. at 81.) \nApplicant testified the last time he looked at any pornography was June of 2021. \nHe has been undergoing marriage counseling and therapy for sexually compulsive \nbehavior since June 2021. (Tr. at 30-31; GE 3; AE B; AE C.) He did not stop viewing \npornography until he went into therapy in June 2021. (Tr. at 36-37.) His treatment provider \nand sponsor for Sex Addicts Anonymous both noted he had made significant strides in \nbeing sober and dealing with his sexually compulsive behaviors. (AE B; AE C.) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied that he falsified his SF 86 responses and \nadded after the denial \u201cwith the mitigating evidence provided.\u201d (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, 3.d) He \nacknowledged his actions but cited his intent at the time was not to falsify his answers \nbased on his understanding of the situation. (GE 1; Tr. at 72.) He testified he believed the \nstatements were the truth at the time. He denied falsifying the SF 86 because when he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas escorted out of his facility he was not specifically told why. He acknowledged he \nknew that what he had been doing was wrong and that he should not have done it. \nBecause he did not get an official statement saying why he was relieved of his position at \nthe time, he thought he was putting in the correct information. (Tr. at 77-78.) \nApplicant did not report on his SF 86 that between April 2020 and August 2020, he \nused his company computer to view pornography. In Section 27 he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nuse of information technology systems questions, which stated: \nIn the last seven (7) years have you introduced, removed, or used \nhardware, software, or media in connection with any information technology \nsystem without authorization, when specifically prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations, or attempted any of the above? \n[He] answered \u201cNo\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose that information set \nforth in subparagraph 1.a., above. \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2021. The \ninvestigator asked him if he had used media with any information technology system \nwithout authorization when specifically prohibited by rules procedures, or regulations, and \nhe answered \"no.\" (GE 2 at 8; Tr. at 80-81.) Upon being confronted with information, he \ntold the investigator that he had viewed pornographic material and pictures while \nemployed as the system administrator for his company. (Tr. at 81; GE 2 at 8.) He told the \ninvestigator during his interview in July 2021 that he was aware that he was violating \ngovernment policy and procedures by viewing pornography and having sexually explicit \nchats while working and on a government computer. He acknowledged to the investigator \nthat he was extremely embarrassed and that was a reason he did not disclose the \nincident. (Tr. 55-57; GE 2 at 8.) \nApplicant did not report on his SF 86 that in September 2020, he resigned in lieu \nof being fired by his employer for viewing-pornographic material on his company \ncomputer. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.d alleged he falsified his answers to Section 13A \u2013 \nEmployment Activities: \n[I]n the last seven (7) years?... Fired\u2026Quit after being told you would be \nfired\u2026Left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct\u2026Left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance.\u201d [He] answered \u201cNo\u201d and deliberately failed to disclose that \ninformation set forth in subparagraph 1.b, above. \nProvide the reason for leaving the employment activity. [He] answered \nthat [he] left because the contract was canceled and deliberately failed to \ndisclose that information set forth in subparagraph 1.b, above. \nApplicant cited a misunderstanding based on how he was removed from the facility \nby two security guards. He testified the guards said you know what you did, when they \nremoved him from the property, and he was never told why he was being escorted from \nthe property. (Tr. at 33, 60, 77; GE 1 at 16.) When he gave his answers, he believed he \nwas telling the truth. (Tr. at 77-78.)

(Tr. at 80.) He did not disclose the \ncircumstances until confronted by the investigator in his security clearance interview. (Tr. \nat 81-82.) Applicant did not disclose in his SF 86 the circumstances of him being caught \nviewing pornography at work, his subsequent termination, or that he was escorted off the \nsite by security and his government devices were confiscated. He stated he \u201chad \nconvinced [himself] that those were the correct answers.\u201d (Tr. at 81, 83-84.) \nApplicant attributed his denials as \u201cacting out and during [his] addiction, I had \nconvinced myself that those were accurate statements.\u201d (Tr. at 84.) After going through \ntherapy and speaking with other people with the similar addiction and similar experiences, \nhe realized that as he had been lying to himself, the Government, his wife, his friends, \nand his family. (Tr. at 84.) He then went on to explain the lack of communication about \nthe circumstances of his termination from his former employer and that he did not receive \nan official email or document advising him of the reasons for his termination. (Tr. at 84; \nGE 2 at 8-9.) \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, that he did not deliberately falsify his SF 86, was not \ncredible. He was the system administrator, and he knew viewing pornography on his work \ncomputer at his worksite was prohibited. (Tr. at 53-57.) The conduct that required him to \nfind a new job had happened just five months prior to completing the SF 86. He was \naware of each falsification on his SF 86 when he completed it. When he was interviewed \nby the investigator a few months later, he denied his actions and only discussed them \nafter being confronted by the investigator. He acknowledged that putting these matters \non his SF 86 would jeopardize his employment chances. (Tr. at 55, 80-82; GE 2 at 8.) \nApplicant has now configured his life to prevent him from accessing pornography. \nHis home is now behind a wireless router that he has set up to completely block explicit \nmaterial. He also blocks TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and porn sites. He has made sure \nhis other laptops and the tablets have profiles that are configured to block inappropriate \nsites and the laptops do not leave the house. (Tr. at 88.) Applicant offered four character \nletters attesting their trust and confidence in him to deal with his addiction. (AE A.) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nApplicant admitted he used his employer\u2019s computer to view pornography while \nworking as his company\u2019s system administrator. He knew that his behavior was against \ncompany policy, which resulted in him resigning from his position, in lieu of being fired. \nHis behavior reflected a severe lack of judgment and made him vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, and duress. The above disqualifying conditions have been established. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the \nbehavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant behavior is recent, and his treatment is ongoing. His actions occurred in \na nonprivate place, his workplace. His viewing pornography cannot be considered strictly \nprivate or discreet because it occurred on his work computer. He spent a significant \namount of time at work engaged in viewing pornography during working hours. While he \nhas made progress in his treatment, insufficient time has passed to determine whether \nhis treatment has been effective. I find that Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(d) are \nnot applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(c) and 14(e) may have some applicability, but they are \ninsufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s unacceptable behavior and rule violations. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nApplicant knew he was violating company policy when he accessed pornography \non his employer\u2019s computers while working in the IT component of his company. The \nabove disqualifying condition is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe above analysis under sexual behavior also applies here. Applicant\u2019s conduct \nis recent, and he did not acknowledge it until he received the SOR. His conduct continues \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 41(a) is not \napplicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole- person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

Applicant willfully did not \ndisclose his viewing pornography at work; the misuse of his government computer; and \nlosing his job because of viewing pornography on his SF 86, because he knew that it \nwould be problematic for his security clearance. His explanation that he was never \ninformed why he was terminated after having been escorted out by security was not \ncredible. He spent half of his workday viewing pornography and having sexually explicit \nonline chats. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator and asked if he \nused media information technology without authorization in the last 7 years he responded \n\u201cno\u201d and did not disclose that he was viewing pornography on a work computer until he \nwas confronted. He admitted to the investigator he did not disclose his actions because \nof extreme embarrassment. He also cited that he was not informed by his company \nbecause he had not received any further communication, so he assumed his clearance \nwas in good standing. This later response is not credible.   \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about what he believed when he completed the SF 86 was \nnot credible. Stating on the SF 86 that he left because the contract had been cancelled, \nwhen he had been the system administrator and had been escorted out of his workplace \nby security after viewing pornography on his company computer, is not credible.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,  \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant was not credible when \nhe says, he convinced himself that when he was completing the SF 86, he believed he \nwas not lying and was not deliberately providing false information. He did not make a \nprompt effort to correct the omissions. He denied his misuse of information technology in \nmultiple sections of his SF 86 and during his security clearance interview, as well as not \ndisclosing his employment history on his SF 86. He continued blame his former employer \nfor not fully communicating with him. His conduct is recent. The above analysis under \nsexual behavior also applies here to his personal conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, M, and E \nin my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service, \ncharacter evidence, and the progress he has made in treatment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n         \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the sexual behavior, use of information technology security, and personal \nconduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n   Paragraph 1, Guideline D: \n \n \n \n \n                 Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:                 \n \n \n            Paragraph 2, Guideline M: \n \n \n \n                        \n \n \n \n            Paragraph 3, Guideline E: \n \n \n \n \n                Subparagraphs  3.a-3.e: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(AE G) \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Pakistan \nPakistan is a parliamentary Islamic republic with significant internal problems \ncaused by terrorist organizations concentrated in several locations within the country. In \nSeptember 2012, the United States officially declared the Haqqani Network a foreign \nterrorist organization. \nAs of 2014, parts of Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa province, and Balochistan province were regarded as safe havens for \nterrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, \nLasahkar I Jhangvi, and the Afghan Taliban. These groups create ongoing security \nproblems by targeting western interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority \npolitical groups, and religious entities. \nPakistani military operations in 2014 against some of the terror groups had only \nmarginal success. With the passage of time, there has been an overall decline in the \nscope and frequency of terrorist attacks. In 2019, the country took coordinated action \nagainst several terrorist groups by disrupting their financing and indicting some of their \nleaders. However, terrorist activity increased substantially in 2021, with insurgents \nattacking various targets, implementing tactics like improvised explosive devices, \nvehicle explosive devices, suicide bombing, and assassinations. \nThe human rights record of Pakistan is not good. Extrajudicial killings, torture, \nand disappearances have been reported, along with intrusive government surveillance \nof politicians, political activists, and the media. Government and police corruption, \nsexual harassment, and gender discrimination are persistent problems. Pakistani \ngovernment authorities seldom punish government officials for human rights violations. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nThe nature of a country\u2019s government, its relationship to the United States, and \nits human rights record, are relevant subjects to consider in evaluating the chances that \nan applicant\u2019s foreign family members are vulnerable to pressure or influence by a \nforeign government or interest that may cause Applicant to violate security regulations. \nTerrorist organizations continue to operate against the United States and Pakistani \ninterests from safe havens within the country. The government has a poor human rights \nrecord that is exacerbated by the country\u2019s terrorism and violence. When evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s ties to foreign family members, the totality of an applicant\u2019s foreign family \nties as well as each individual family tie must be considered. Conditions under AG \u00b6 7 \nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nContacts and ties with family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation. Applicant has a sister, a brother-in-law, two uncles, and multiple \nfriends, who are citizens and residents of Pakistan.

(SOR \u00b6 1.f) The totality of these contacts and the threat of \nterrorism in Pakistan generates a heightened risk of coercion or exploitation under AG \u00b6 \n7(a) and a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 (7(b). \nApplicant\u2019s financial and property interests identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, \nand 1.k raise a heightened risk of foreign influence within the purview of SOR \u00b6 7 (g) of \nthe foreign influence guideline. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; and \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s sister, uncles, cousin, and friends are \nresidents and citizens of Pakistan. Government operatives or insurgent groups could \nexert pressure on Applicant through his foreign family members to obtain U.S. classified \nor sensitive information, or to damage the United States in some other way. \nThere is insufficient mitigating evidence to find AG \u00b6 8(b) in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHe has a 61-year-old sister, a naturalized U.S. citizen, living in State F, and a cousin, a \npermanent resident of the United States. While Applicant has been a U.S. citizen for \neight years, between 2014 and August 2018, he was employed at least part time by \nuniversities or agencies affiliated with the Pakistani government. He has been working \nfor his current employer since August 2018, but there is no documented character \nevidence from supervisors and coworkers. In addition, there is no documented \nperformance evidence. He belongs to no civic associations in the United States. He has \nnever owned a home or a car in the United States. In sum, Applicant has provided \ninadequate evidence of deep and longstanding relationships in the United States. \nThe frequency of Applicant\u2019s trips to Pakistan to visit family members and \nfriends demonstrates that his connection to his foreign family members is not casual \nand infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nThe size of Applicant\u2019s financial interests in Pakistan compared to his financial \ninterests in the United States removes AG \u00b6 8(f) from consideration. His financial and \nproperty interests in Pakistan amount to more than $2,000,000. In contrast, his financial \ninterests in the United States are about one tenth of that amount. Though Applicant \ntestified that he was trying to divest himself from his Pakistani interests as soon as he \ncould, he provided no documentation to substantiate his claims of resolving any of the \nPakistani financial interests or real property. Furthermore, his testimony contradicts his \nroommate\u2019s statements indicating that he could easily divest, but was bound by the \nwishes of his relatives to hold onto the property of his mother and father. \nForeign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 sets forth the security concerns under Guideline C: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an \nindividual's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in \nconflict with U.S. national interests or when the individual acts to \n11 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconceal it. By itself ; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of \nanother country is not disqualifying without an objective showing of \nsuch conflict or attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. \ncitizen's exercise of any right or privilege of foreign citizenship and any \naction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship. \nAG \u00b6 10. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued \nby any country other than the United States; \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of \nemployment, position, or political office in a foreign \ngovernment or military organization; and \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in any way that \nconflicts with U.S. national security interests; and \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests \nin another country in violation of U.S. law. \nAG \u00b6 10(a) applies because Applicant was born in Pakistan and is a dual citizen \nof the country and the United States. I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 10(b) due to the \nabsence of evidence requiring him to report his possession of a Pakistani identity card \nand there is no indication that he endeavored to conceal the card. \nAG \u00b6 10(d)(1) applies to Applicant\u2019s employment in the entities identified in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.l through 1.o as he was being paid between $2,000 and $2,500 a month on a part-\ntime basis by three of the four agencies or universities associated with the Pakistani \ngovernment. Reference J, who was familiar with Applicant\u2019s work during the period \n2014 to 2020, considered that Applicant\u2019s contributions to the research project relating \nto climate and flood control for the university identified at SOR \u00b6 1.o, was in the U.S. \ninterest. The record shows that Applicant\u2019s employment with these foreign universities \nor agencies affiliated with the Pakistani government ended in 2020. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 11 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n12 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in \na foreign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the \nforeign citizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n(d) the exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen; \n(e) the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship \ndo not present a national security concern; and \n(f) the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, \nentity, or association that poses a low national security risk. \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security interests \nand there is no evidence that Applicant has acted in a way that indicates a preference \nfor a foreign country over the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a) and 11(b) apply. Applicant has \nnot expressed a willingness to renounce his Pakistani citizenship. However, there is no \nobjective evidence that his foreign citizenship is in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests. AG 11(c) applies. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(d) and 11(e) apply because the SOR does not allege that Applicant \nexercised rights of foreign citizenship before he became a U.S citizen. His use of the \nPakistani identity card does not present a national security concern. Judging by the \ntotality of all the evidence, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 11(f). While the presence of \nterrorists in Pakistan and the human rights abuses exacerbate the potential for foreign \ninfluence being exerted on Applicant, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that he \nhas a preference for Pakistan over the United States. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \n13 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 1.l-1.o:   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the context of all the surrounding \ncircumstances in this case, including the heightened risk of terrorism in Pakistan. \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence concerns, because of his regular \ncontacts with his foreign family members and considerable financial interests in \nPakistan. Conversely, I conclude that his part-time employment in research projects for \nentities affiliated with the Pakistani government do not indicate a preference for \nPakistan over the United States. Nor does the employment indicate an inclination to \nmake decisions harmful to the United States. \nOne final item that warrants comment is the brief filed by Applicant\u2019s counsel in \nadvance of the hearing. He has cited several hearing level cases to support his \nargument that Applicant merits a security clearance. The DOHA Appeal Board has \nrepeatedly indicated that hearing level judges are not required to align their decisions \nwith other hearing level judges. ISCR Case No. 19-00657 at 3 (July 21, 2021) See also \nISCR Case No. 19-00327 at 3 (App. Bd. May 20, 2020). Under the Directive 5220.6, \nEncl 2. App. A \u00b6 2(b), at page 21, every security clearance case must be resolved on its \nown merits. Considering the evidence from an overall commonsense point of view, \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by the foreign influence \nguideline. He has mitigated the foreign preference concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C):  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.j, and 1.m), except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since July 2021, as a senior systems engineer. His current annual gross salary is approximately $150,000 per year. He has worked for government contractors since 2011, which is also when he first received a security clearance. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He attended graduate school from 2009 to 2010, but he did not complete his master\u2019s degree. He married in 2010, and has three children, ages 12, 6, and 4. (Items 3-4). The SOR alleged Applicant incurred nine delinquent debts, comprised of student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f), federal and state tax debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.l), and one consumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) totaling approximately $121,307. Approximately $116,000 of the total debt is derived from his student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f). The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2016-2019 and 2022 federal income tax returns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m); his State A income tax returns for tax years 2016 to 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); his State B income tax returns for tax years 2018 to 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); and his State C income tax return for tax year 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). Non-tax Debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g): Applicant explained that this debt",

Upon the resumption of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to \namend the SOR to add another allegation under Guideline F (see discussion, infra). \nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested, and I granted a continuance to allow Applicant additional \ntime to address the amended SOR allegation. A rescheduled hearing was held on \nFebruary 5, 2024 by mutual agreement. \nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit \n(HE) I and its discovery letter sent to Applicant was marked as HE II. The SOR \namendment reflected in Department Counsel\u2019s January 18, 2024 email was marked as \nHE III, and Applicant\u2019s response was marked as HE IV. The Government\u2019s January 26, \n2024 email request for me to take administrative notice of DOHA hearing decision # 17-\n01960, dated December 3, 2018, which also involved this Applicant, was marked as HE \nV. This exhibit also included Applicant\u2019s August 4, 2017 SOR from that case. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-TT, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcripts as follows: December 19, 2023 \ntranscript received January 4, 2024 (Tr1); January 18, 2024 transcript received January \n25, 2024 (Tr2); and February 5, 2024 transcript received February 12, 2024 (Tr3). \nProcedural and Evidentiary Issues \nAs refenced above, on January 18, 2024, Department moved to amend the SOR \nto add an additional allegation under Guideline F. That allegation is noted as SOR \u00b6 1.m \nand states: \u201cYou failed to timely file, as required, your federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax year 2022.\u201d (HE III) I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend, \nbut I also allowed Applicant a continuance to consider his response to the new \nallegation. The hearing was recessed until February 5, 2024. Applicant responded to \nSOR \u00b6 1.m, in writing through counsel, on February 5, 2024, by admitting the allegation \nand stating that further mitigating evidence would be submitted during the hearing. (HE \nIV) \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of Appellant\u2019s \nearlier DOHA case. This case is # 17-01960, in which a decision was issued by a \ndifferent hearing judge granting Applicant\u2019s access to classified information on \nDecember 3, 2018. The SOR in that case was included in the request for administrative \nnotice. That SOR included, inter alia, allegations involving delinquent student loans that \nare also alleged in this SOR. Appellant objected to my taking administrative notice \nbased upon relevance. I overruled the objection and took notice of the previous decision \nand SOR because the decision and SOR were issued by a government agency and not \nsubject to dispute. The relevance of the previous decision and SOR to this case is that \nthe same student loans had gone back into a default status after Applicant stopped \npaying on a payment plan from April 2020 to March 2023, which was recognized in the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nearlier decision.

(HE V; Tr1 at 151; Tr3 at 24; AE OO) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.j, and 1.m), except \nfor \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since July 2021, as a senior systems engineer. His current annual gross \nsalary is approximately $150,000 per year. He has worked for government contractors \nsince 2011, which is also when he first received a security clearance. He holds a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He attended graduate school from 2009 to 2010, but he did not \ncomplete his master\u2019s degree. He married in 2010, and has three children, ages 12, 6, \nand 4. (Items 3-4). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant incurred nine delinquent debts, comprised of student \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f), federal and state tax debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.l), and one consumer \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) totaling approximately $121,307. Approximately $116,000 of the total \ndebt is derived from his student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f). The SOR also alleged that \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2016-2019 and 2022 federal income tax returns (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m); his State A income tax returns for tax years 2016 to 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); \nhis State B income tax returns for tax years 2018 to 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); and his State C \nincome tax return for tax year 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). \nNon-tax Debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g): \nApplicant explained that this debt resulted when he switched telecommunication \ncarriers and did not initially return equipment to the discontinued carrier. He was \ncharged $716 by the carrier. He returned the equipment on May 11, 2021, and provided \na receipt showing the return. This debt is resolved. (Tr1 at 68; AE E) \nStudent Loan Debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.f; SOR \u00b6 1.b): \nApplicant admitted that by the time he left graduate school he had incurred \nstudent-loan debt. He incurred two types of student loans. The first type were privately \nfinanced and represent the greater SOR balance and will be referred to hereinafter as \nprivate student loans (PSLs) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.f). Applicant believed these PSLs went \ninto default status in 2012 or 2013. These loans were not covered by the CARES Act \nstudent loan forbearance and zero interest rate relief during the Covid pandemic from \nMarch 2020 to approximately October 2023. His second type of student loans were \nfederally guaranteed and were serviced independently from the PSLs. These federal \nstudent loans will be referred to hereinafter as FSLs (SOR \u00b6 1.b). These loans were \ncovered by the CARES Act forbearance and interest relief features, but Applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadmitted these loans were delinquent before the CARES Act relief was instituted. (Tr1 \nat 24, 65, 94-95, 101, 117-118, 151-152) \nIn order to understand when Applicant incurred his student loans and when they \nwere defaulted, in relationship to other life events going on at the same time, I have set \nforth a timeline based on the evidence. That timeline is as follows: \n2006-2007: Applicant testified that he made some payments on his student loans during \nthis time between his graduation from undergraduate school and his entrance into \ngraduate school. He did not indicate if these payments were toward PSLs or FSLs. A \ncredit report shows five PSLs were assigned for collection in 2002, 2005, 2006, and two \nin 2007. (Tr1 at 96-98; GE 3) \n2009-2010: Applicant\u2019s student loans were deferred while he attended graduate school. \nWhen he stopped going to grad school, his deferment ended, in approximately October \n2010. He approximated his student loan total was $145,000 at that time. He married in \nJuly 2010. He also received an engineering job offer with a government agency. This \njob offered necessitated that he and his wife move to another state. After moving, the \njob offer was rescinded because of a federal hiring freeze that occurred. He found \nseveral temporary jobs for about the next eight months in order to support his family. \nHis wife was hired for a teaching position which paid about $50,000 annually. (Tr1 at 24, \n28-29, 32-34, 99, AE O) \n2011: In April, Applicant was hired for a fulltime engineering position with a defense \ncontractor. His starting annual salary was approximately $56,000. At about the same \ntime, his wife found out she was pregnant. This came as a surprise to them because \npreviously, doctors told them there was only about a 10% chance she could ever \nbecome pregnant. Because of medical complications, doctors placed his wife on \ncomplete bed rest and she had to stop working in June or July 2011. In December, their \nfirst daughter was born. (Tr1 at 35-37, 39-43) \n2012: Applicant\u2019s wife was able to go back to work in approximately October 2012. \nDuring this time Applicant was able to pay all his monthly debts except his student \nloans. (Tr1 at 43-45) \n2012-2013: Sometime during this timeframe, and after a period of forbearance by the \nlenders, Applicant\u2019s student loans went into default status. He did not specify whether \nthey were the PSLs, or the FSLs, or both. (Tr1 at 100-102) \n2014: Applicant attempted to consolidate his student loans. (Tr1 at 48) \n2012-2015: Between these years, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished by the FSL \nservicer based upon the defaulted loans. The amount was $1,000 monthly. Applicant \nadmitted he was not proactive about setting up an alternative payment plan to the \ngarnishment. He believed the garnishment served as a forced payment plan, so he left it \nin place. What he did not realize was that his defaulted FSLs continued to accrue daily \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterest during the garnishment period.

(Tr1 at 49-50, 106) \n2015-2017: Sometime during this period, Applicant consulted a debt counseling service. \n(Tr1 at 51) \n2017: Early in the year, Applicant\u2019s wife found out she was pregnant with their second \nchild. She was ordered on bed rest for the entire pregnancy and stopped working again. \nIn August 2017, Applicant\u2019s SOR from his first case was issued. Their second daughter \nwas born in October. (Tr1 at 52-53; HE V) \n2017-2018: Sometime during this period, Applicant made double monthly payments on \nhis FSLs to have the garnishment removed. (Tr1 at 51) \n2018: Applicant was hired by another defense contractor in a higher paying position. His \nwife was working as a consultant, which did not pay as well as her teaching position. On \nOctober 4th, Applicant had his DOHA hearing in his first case. The decision in that case, \ngranting his clearance, was published on December 3rd. Applicant entered into a \npayment plan for his PSL on October 19th. His payments were $250 monthly. He made \nhis first payment in October 2018 and continued making monthly payments through \nMarch 20, 2020, when he stopped because he could no longer afford them and the \nPSLs went into default status again. (Tr1 at 54, 151; AE OO, SS; HE V) \n2019: In the fall, Applicant\u2019s wife went back to teaching fulltime. Shortly thereafter, they \nfound out she was pregnant with their third child. (Tr1 at 54) \n2020: In January, Applicant\u2019s wife was ordered on bed rest and again had to stop \nworking. In May their third daughter was born. Their daughter was born with health \ncomplications and required extensive medical services. As stated above, Applicant \nmade no payments on his PSL payment plan from April 2020 until April 2023. His FSLs \nwere in a default status before the CARES Act put them in forbearance. (Tr1 at 56-58, \n151-152; AE OO) \n2022: The SOR in this case was issued on October 4, 2022. (SOR) \n2021-2023: Applicant testified that during this timeframe he received several pay raises, \nwhich increased his annual salary to about $150,000. This was more than both he and \nhis wife made previously. In March 2023, the servicer of his PSLs changed. In April \n2023, he entered into a settlement agreement with the new servicer of his PSLs. Under \nthe agreement, over $161,000 of Applicant\u2019s PSLs would be settled for a total payment \nof approximately $20,000, payable in 48 monthly payments of $420, beginning April 18, \n2023. He made the monthly payments starting in April 2023 through August 2023. In \napproximately September, the loan servicer experienced a problem with its automatic \nonline payment system and Applicant\u2019s payments for September through December \n2023 were not made.

(Tr1 at 23, 59, 62, 110-114, 151; AE C, OO, TT) \n2023: On December 18, 2023, Applicant was approved for the Fresh Start Initiative for \nhis defaulted FSLs. This process will allow him to rehabilitate his FSLs under a payment \nplan. He was awaiting further information from the servicing company concerning the \ndetails of his payment plan. He speculated that his monthly payments would be about \n$650, which he believes he can make without a problem. (Tr1 at 66-67; AE KK) \n2024: In January 2024, Applicant was told by the former servicer of his PSLs that he \nshould begin making payment back to it because the payment system for the \nsubsequent provider was still inoperable. Appellant documented making a payment to \nthe former servicer by paper check on January 23rd  for $420. In February 2024, the \nservicer for Applicant\u2019s FSLs provided him a copy of an account summary, including a \ntotal amount owed of over $35,000. While this summary did not include the monthly \namount he would pay, Applicant was told by a representative the amount would be \n$487. As of the last hearing date, February 5, 2024, he had not started making \npayments on his FSLs. (Tr3 at 16-17; AE NN-PP) \nFederal and State Tax issues: \n2016-Federal Taxes Owed ($2,716; SOR \u00b6 1.k): \nApplicant initially thought that he did not owe federal taxes for tax year 2016, \nbecause he mistakenly believed he received a refund after 2016 and that would not \nhave happened if he owed the IRS for past taxes. A 2016 federal return prepared by a \ntax service on April 26, 2021, showed that Applicant would owe $2,716, for that year. \nThe IRS denied receiving this return, as reflected by a September 2022 IRS account \ntranscript. Applicant mailed a paper return for tax year 2016 on January 30, 2024. As of \nFebruary 5, 2024, he could not confirm that the IRS received his 2016 federal income \ntax return. By his calculations, based on the paper return, he owed approximately $700 \nfor tax year 2016. This debt is unresolved.

He then provided \ndocumentation showing he entered into a payment plan with State A in April 2023. That \ndocumentation shows a larger balance owed of $4,457.

Applicant claims part of the \nreason his 2022 tax return was late was because when it was due his wife was not yet \nworking and they could not afford to hire a tax preparer. He does not believe he will be \nin this situation in the future because both he and his wife have well-paying jobs and \nthey will not have any more children because he recently underwent a vasectomy.

(AE N, P-R) \nApplicant\u2019s counsel also requested consideration of a waiver or granting of a \nconditional clearance, in the event Applicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. This request \nwill be discussed in my Analysis section. (SOR Answer; AE Z) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nThe evidence established that Applicant has delinquent student loans, failed to \ntimely file federal and state income tax returns for the years indicated, failed to pay his \nfederal taxes in 2016, and his State A taxes in 2016 and 2018. He resolved the sole \nconsumer debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g and that is concluded for him. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised regarding the remaining SOR allegations. \nBefore addressing the applicability of any mitigating conditions, the nature of \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues and student loan defaults merit specific comment. Failure to \ncomply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-\nestablished government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-\n01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that the while CARES Act provisions effectively \nplaces qualifying student loans in a deferment status, it does not excuse Applicant's \npast inactions in the context of security clearance eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 20-\n01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021) \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans originated back in 2006 and are ongoing and remain \nunresolved. Both his PSLs and his FSLs have been in default status multiple times. \nMost recently he defaulted on his PSL payment plan from April 2020 to March 2023. \nThis is the payment plan the administrative judge in Applicant\u2019s case # 17-01960 \n(December 3, 2018) partially relied upon to mitigate his delinquent student loans at that \ntime. While he provided proof that he made a payment on his PSL plan in January \n2024, he failed to show that he paid the current loan servicer for the uncollected \npayments of October through December 2023. His defaulted FSLs were recently turned \nover to a new servicer. He believes his monthly payments on his FSLs will be \napproximately $487, but as of February 2024, he had not yet made any payments. \nOver the years Applicant has had several events that affected his financial \npicture that were beyond his control. The most significant of which was his wife\u2019s \nunemployment during her three pregnancies due to medical necessity. However, \noverall, he has not acted responsibly with his student loans. An example of this is when \nhe allowed his FSL to remain subject to a garnishment action rather than trying to work \nout a payment plan. He admitted he just looked at the garnishment as a forced payment \nplan. Payment of a debt through garnishment is not a good-faith effort to repay it. \nAnother example is when he allowed his PSL to go back into default in 2020, after \nestablishing a payment plan in 2018. Applicant has sought financial counseling, \nhowever, despite that counseling, his student loans are not yet under control. Applicant \nhas an erratic student-loan payment history. He was also given an opportunity in his first \nDOHA case to rectify these defaulted student loans by adhering to his payment plan but \nfailed to do so. These actions continue to put his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment into question. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b)-20(d) \nhave some application, but are not controlling for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f. \nApplicant admitted the reason he failed to timely file his federal and various state \ntax returns for the years indicated was because he and his wife argued over who would \nprepare and file these returns. When neither committed to preparing the returns, they \nwent unfiled for several years. This is the height of irresponsibility and reflects \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment.

However, the evidence shows that his 2016, 2017, and 2022 federal returns were \nnot filed until January 2024, long past their filing due dates. As of February 5, 2024, \nthere was no acknowledgement that the IRS received his 2016 or 2017 returns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) and 20(b) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j and 1.m.

He documented \nhis payment plan to State A for his tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.l, but not to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.m. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s work as a \ncontractor, his family\u2019s medical issues, his character testimony and letters, and his work \naccomplishments. I also considered his failure to resolve his student loans over the \ncourse of 18 years and his irresponsibility in refusing to timely file his state and federal \ntax returns as required as indicated by the evidence. I also note that Applicant was \ngiven a chance back in 2018 to right his financial ship when the judge in his prior DOHA \ncase mitigated the financial concerns and granted his clearance. It seems he learned \nlittle from that experience. Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nWaiver-Conditional Clearance (SEAD 4) \nApplicant\u2019s long history of student loan defaults and intentionally failing to comply \nwith his tax filing requirements do not support the application of issuing either a waiver \nor granting a conditional clearance. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. The benefit of continued eligibility does not outweigh \nthe existing security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.k, 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g, 1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 24, 2021, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application \n(SCA). \n(Government \nExhibit \n(GE) \n1) \nOn \nJanuary \n9, \n2024, \nthe \nDefense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services \n(CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, and on June 10, 2024, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an amended SOR. The SORs \nwere issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR and Amended SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS and DOHA \ndid not find under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the SOR and Amended SOR set forth \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline H. (HE 2, HE 4) On April 5, 2024, Applicant \nprovided a response to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3) On June 10, 2024, \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed.  \nOn June 25, 2024, the case was assigned to me. On July 12, 2024, DOHA issued \na notice, setting the hearing for August 15, 2024. (HE 1) The hearing was held as \nscheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered two exhibits into evidence; and Applicant offered 20 \nexhibits into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 14-16; GE 1-GE 2; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE T) \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of GE 2, summarized results of Applicant\u2019s \npersonal subject interview. (Tr. 9) Department Counsel did not oppose Applicant\u2019s \nobjection, and I sustained the objection to admissibility of GE 2. (Tr. 10) There were no \nother objections, and I admitted the other proffered exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 14, 16; GE \n1; AE A-T) On August 23, 2024, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. The record \nclosed on September 16, 2024. (Tr. 191) No post-hearing documents were received. \nProcedural Issues \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, there were no \nobjections, and I granted the motions. (Tr. 8-9, 14) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted in part the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.

(HE 3 at 7-10; \nAE J-R) He has held a public trust position since December 2021. (Tr. 86, 96-99) In 2002, \nhe received a bachelor\u2019s degree. (AE G) He attended several post-graduate educational \ninstitutions. (AE G) After around July 2022, Applicant was not interested in seeking a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 87) Additional information about his professional background is in \nhis resume. (AE J) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nBefore working for a defense contractor, Applicant worked in an area where \nimagination and creativity were prized, and use of illegal drugs was common. Applicant \ndid not believe use of illegal drugs adversely affected his life. (Tr. 26-27) He has never \nbeen arrested. (Tr. 27) He has never been addicted to illegal drugs.

(Tr. 32; GE 1) His current employer prohibits the use of \nillegal drugs. (Tr. 58) He volunteered in his community. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nAugust 1994 to at least April 2021. (HE 2) The Amended SOR alleges he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about August 1994 to at least December 2023. (HE 4) SOR \n\u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant used psilocybin with varying frequency from about August 1997 \nto at least December 2019. (HE 2) The Amended SOR alleges he used psilocybin \nmushrooms with varying frequency from about August 1997 to at least December 2023. \n(Tr. 14; HE 4) \nApplicant began using marijuana when he was 14 years old. (Tr. 61) In his \nSeptember 24, 2021 SCA Applicant said, \u201cI have been a fairly consistent user of cannabis \nthroughout much of my life, but over the past year [2021] have tapered off and switched \nto [cannabinoids or] CBD. (Tr. 60; GE 1 at 39) He said he used drugs \u201cto relax and unwind, \nrelieve anxiety, help with sleep, or help with creativity, Frequency - 1 - 2x/week, but have \nnot used in 6 months, have switched to CBD.\u201d (GE 1 at 39) The last time that Applicant \nsmoked marijuana was around April 2021. (Tr. 35) He switched to tetrahydrocannabinol \n(THC)-free CBD. (Tr. 60-61) \nIn his SCA, Applicant also said, \u201cI have experimented with psilocybin recreationally \non and off in my life. [M]y use has tapered off over the past few years.\u201d (GE 1 at 40) The \nfrequency of his psilocybin use was experimental, about one to two times per year.\u201d (Tr. \n70; AE B at 40) He estimated that he used psilocybin a total of about 10 to 20 times from \n1997 to 2019. (Tr. 70; GE 1 at 40) In his SCA, he said that he did not intend to use \nmarijuana or psilocybin mushrooms in the future. (Tr. 71; SCA at 39-40) He meant that \nhe did not intend to engage in recreational use of these drugs in the future. (Tr. 72) He \ndid not use illegal drugs recreationally after completion of his SCA. (Tr. 103) \nApplicant accepted the manufacturer\u2019s statement that the CBDs he purchased \nwere THC-free. (Tr. 64-65) He used THC-free CBDs about once a week. (Tr. 66) He \nmaintains friendships and infrequently associates with marijuana users. (Tr. 52) On \nFebruary 5, 2024, and July 11, 2024, he submitted hair follicles for drug testing, and all \ntests were negative for the presence of illegal substances. (Tr. 53; HE 3 at 6; AE F; AE \nT) A February 8, 2024 substance use assessment of Applicant did not diagnose him with \na substance use disorder. (Tr. 53; HE 3 at 5; AE D) Applicant has attended mental-health \ncounseling. (AE E)  \nIn his SOR response, Applicant said he used psilocybin, marijuana, and THC \nproducts \u201crecreationally and therapeutically between approximately August 1994 and \nDecember 2023.\u201d (HE 3 at 3) Around September 2023, he took some micro-doses of \npsilocybin and small amounts of THC, primarily to help with sleep, control of his thoughts, \nand anxiety. (Tr. 39-40, 61) He believes that taking small amounts of THC is therapeutic \nand does not have psychoactive effects. (Tr. 40) In his state, micro-doses of psilocybin \nand therapeutic marijuana use have been decriminalized. (Tr. 40-42) He had chronic \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninsomnia starting in early 2022. (Tr. 33) He took CBDs to help with anxiety and insomnia. \n(Tr. 33-34) \nIn 2023, Applicant was feeling lonely, isolated and some displacement. (Tr. 36-37) \nIn September 2023, a man living with Applicant, who suffered from depression, committed \nsuicide. (Tr. 38, 87) In September 2023, Applicant decided to resume THC and psilocybin \nuse for therapeutic reasons. (Tr. 88-89) From September 2023 to December 2023, he \nused a micro-psilocybin dose about once or twice a week during the day, and a CBD with \na small amount of THC every other night for sleep. (Tr. 90-93) His use of psilocybin and \nTHC was based on his personal research and not based on medical advice. (Tr. 90) His \nuse of psilocybin may have been criminal under state law because the psilocybin he used \nwas not medically supervised. (Tr. 90) \nApplicant realized in November 2021 that his use of illegal drugs such as marijuana \nand psilocybin violated federal law and was incompatible with holding a security \nclearance. (Tr. 104) He believed he may have held a sensitive position when he was \nusing illegal drugs in 2023. (Tr. 104-105) Applicant said in his SOR response: \n[he] very much regrets his decision to use [psilocybin,] marijuana and THC \nproducts, but emphatically denies that this is evidence of a current pattern \nor of habitual drug use. He further disagrees that his history of use of \n[psilocybin.] marijuana and THC products rises to the level of a security \nconcern that can reasonably form the basis of a security clearance denial \nor revocation. (HE 3 at 3) \nApplicant has never received a urinalysis test for the presence of illegal drugs in \nhis body. (Tr. 45, 57) His last use of micro-doses of psilocybin and therapeutic THC were \nin December of 2023. (Tr. 46) He uses other therapies and prescription drugs to help him \nsleep and manage his anxiety. (Tr. 47, 94-95) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges and Applicant admitted that he used ecstasy with varying \nfrequency from about August 1998 to at least April 2018. (HE 2; HE 3 at 3-4) He used \necstasy about 10 times in his life. (Tr. 73) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges and Applicant admitted he used cocaine with varying frequency \nfrom about August 2000 to at least September 2018. (HE 2; HE 3 at 4) Applicant said he \nused cocaine four times. (Tr. 29, 73-74) \nApplicant used ketamine two or three times in his life. (Tr. 74) His ketamine use is \nnot alleged in the SOR, and it will not be considered for disqualification purposes. (Tr. 74-\n75) \nApplicant made the following pledge: \nI, [Applicant], wish to proudly and confidently state that I pledge to continue \nto remain free from all drugs, including CBD and marijuana, and refrain from \nany and all substance abuse. Furthermore, I fully acknowledge, understand, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nand embrace that any future involvement with drugs or misuse of same will \nbe grounds for revocation of my security clearance and any national security \neligibility. I further agree to submit to random urinalysis inspections to prove \nmy compliance and adherence to the above. (HE 3 at 5; AE C) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant provided eight written character statements, and six witnesses made \nstatements on his behalf at his hearing. (Tr. 106-168; AE K-AE R) The statements are \nfrom coworkers, family, and friends. Some friends or coworkers have known him for more \nthan 20 years. The general sense of the character evidence is that Applicant is talented, \ngenerous, exceptionally creative, friendly, intelligent, diligent, dedicated, honest, \nprofessional, and trustworthy. He has the potential to make significant contributions to the \nnational defense. Their statements support his access to classified information. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established \nbecause it is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s position from September to December 2023, \nwhen he used THC and psilocybin was a \u201csensitive position\u201d as contemplated in the \nDirective. Additional discussion of the disqualifying conditions is in the mitigation section, \ninfra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nPossession of Schedules I, II, and III controlled substances is a federal criminal \noffense (Schedule III substances may be possessed with a lawful prescription). Schedules \nI, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana, psilocybin, and ecstasy are Schedule I controlled substances; \ncocaine is a Schedule II controlled substance; and ketamine, is a Schedule III controlled \nsubstance. \nSee \nDrug \nEnforcement \nAdministration, \nSchedules, \nchrome-\nextension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/sche \ndules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf. (HE 5)   \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant frequently possessed and used marijuana or THC and psilocybin \nincluding during the period September to December 2023. In his SCA he said he did not \nintend to use marijuana and psilocybin in the future. His decisions to repeatedly possess \nand use marijuana and psilocybin after completion of his SCA are an indication he lacks \nthe qualities expected of those with access to national secrets. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ketamine possession and use were not alleged in the SOR or Amended \nSOR. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). These non-SOR allegations will not \nbe considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He voluntarily and \ncandidly disclosed his illegal drug use on his SCA, in his SOR response, and during his \nhearing. His statements throughout the security clearance process have been credible \nand consistent. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He does not frequently associate \nwith users of illegal drugs. \nApplicant possessed and used cocaine four times, ecstasy about 10 times, and \nketamine several times; however, his possessions and uses of these illegal substances \nwere not recent. Security concerns pertaining to these substances are mitigated. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant did not fulfill his promises \non his SCA not to use THC and psilocybin. He decided that using these illegal drugs would \nbe beneficial and therapeutic. He made the same promise in his SCA response about not \nusing illegal drugs and at his hearing, and he might conclude in the future that resumption \nof his use of illegal drugs is necessary for his health or other reasons. Use of illegal drugs \nraises concerns about judgment in the context of safeguarding classified information. \nI am not convinced Applicant\u2019s marijuana or THC and psilocybin possession and \nuse \u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur [and] does not cast \ndoubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d A concern remains \nthat he will continue to use marijuana and psilocybin in the future. More time without illegal \ndrug use is necessary to fully mitigate Guideline H security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a large defense contractor. He has made \nsignificant contributions to his employer\u2019s business goals. He has held a public trust \nposition since December 2021. In 2002, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nattended several post graduate educational institutions. He has tremendous experience \nin the private sector that the defense contractor can use to support the national defense. \nApplicant was honest and candid in his descriptions of his use of illegal drugs. He \nprovided eight written character statements, and six witnesses made statements on his \nbehalf at his hearing. The statements are from coworkers, family, and friends. Some \nfriends or coworkers have known him for more than 20 years. The general sense of the \ncharacter evidence is that Applicant is talented, generous, exceptionally creative, friendly, \nintelligent, diligent, dedicated, honest, professional, and trustworthy. Their statements \nsupport his access to classified information. \nThe evidence against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is more \npersuasive. Applicant has a long history of use of illegal drugs including marijuana, \ncocaine, ketamine, ecstasy, and psilocybin. In his September 24, 2021 SCA, he disclosed \nhis history of use of illegal drugs, and he said he did not intend to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. From September to December 2023, he used marijuana or THC and psilocybin \nbecause he believed those substances would help treat his insomnia and anxiety. His \ndecisions to repeatedly possess and use substances which are illegal under federal law \nare an indication he lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under his current \ncircumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, he may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 22) \nIn October 2016, Applicant was hired by a state government agency as an \nacquisition specialist. He was laid off in April 2018 due to restructuring of his position. \nWhile laid off, he worked as a ride-share driver. He was hired in June 2019 as a telecon \nengineer for a defense contractor.

(AX K)  \nApplicant testified that when he was laid off, he contacted his creditors to ask for \na forbearance on his payments for a couple of months. However, they were unwilling to \ndo so. He did not take any further action or seek any credit counseling at that time. (Tr. \n30-31) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in August 2020, he disclosed three of the debts \nalleged in the SOR.

Applicant testified that most \nof the debts alleged in the SOR were incurred after he was laid off in April 2018. (Tr. 20) \nOn January 23, 2023, Applicant hired a credit-counseling service that assisted him in \ndevising a debt management program (DMP) to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.e. However, he subsequently decided not to implement the DMP. Instead, he \ndecided to save money until he can offer lump-sum settlements for these five debts. He \ntestified that he has already saved about $10,000 at a rate of $750 per month.

(AX G) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro.

Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment was a condition \nlargely beyond his control. At first, he acted responsibly by contacting his creditors. \nHowever, when they refused his requests for forbearance, he took no further action until \nhe received the SOR. His timing indicates that he took no further action until he realized \nthat his security clearance was in jeopardy. An applicant who waits until his clearance is \nin jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant received financial counseling but chose \nnot to implement the DMP. The record falls short of \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial \nproblems are being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. He submitted no evidence of recent efforts to resolve \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through1.e. At the hearing, he articulated a plan for resolving \nthose debts, but his plan consists of a promise to save up money and then negotiate \nsettlements at some time in the future. \u201cPromises to pay or otherwise resolve delinquent \ndebts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner \nor otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. \nBd. Sep. 26, 2019). He did not resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.i until \nhe received the SOR. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of \ndebts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 \n(App. Bd.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Additional \nsecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulated delinquent debts that exceed \n$6,000 Applicant\u2019s filing lapses and accumulated delinquent accounts raise trust, \nreliability, and judgment concerns about her current and future ability to manage her \nfinances safely and responsibly. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple tax-filing lapses and accumulated delinquent dets warrant the \napplication of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines. DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), inability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nas required,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses and unresolved debt delinquencies require \nno independent proof to substantiate them.

Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing and payment \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

In the \npast, the Appeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to \nprovide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, \nwhether the issues relate to back taxes or other debts and accounts. See ISCR Case \nNo. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJan. 20, 2020). \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her history of multiple tax-filing and payment lapses and \naccumulated delinquent accounts are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a security clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her work in the \ndefense industry, her efforts are not enough at this time to overcome her repeated \nfailures or inability to address her tax-filing and payment responsibilities in a timely way \nover the course of many years. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment \nhave not been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for her to establish the requisite levels of \nstability with her finances to establish her overall eligibility for holding a security \nclearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 57 years old, divorced from his third wife, and has one adult child and one adult stepchild. He served in the United States Navy from 1992 to 2017, retiring as a senior chief petty officer (E-8). He has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2018 and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 3 at Sections 13A, 15, 17, and 18.) 2 Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR stated that Applicant had seven debts that were past due, charged-off, or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $80,323. He also had one foreclosure of a time share. The existence and amount of these debts is supported by his admissions to three SOR allegations in his Answer and by credit reports dated April 14, 2022; August 22, 2022; and March 6, 2023. They are also confirmed by Applicant\u2019s answers during an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that was held on December 6, 2021. (Items 4, 5, 6, and 7.)

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on November 21, 2022. (Item 2.) \nIn his Answer he admitted allegations 1.b, 1.d, and 1.h in the SOR with explanations. He \ndenied the remaining allegations, also with explanations. \nOn page 2 of his written Answer Applicant stated, \u201cIf this matter is not resolved by \nthe additional information in this Response, I respectfully request a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d However, attached to his Response is a pre-printed election sheet, \nalso dated November 21, 2022. Applicant signed the sheet and initialed the box that \nstates he is requesting: \nA decision based on the administrative (written) record, without a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. This will include a memo \nprepared by DoD Department Counsel. You will have an opportunity to \nrespond to the memo and to provide documents or other evidence before \nthe record is submitted to the Administrative Judge for decision. (Emphasis \nin original.) \nIn order to resolve this conflict Department Counsel contacted Applicant on \nDecember 6, 2023, asking that he, \u201cPlease clarify how you would like your case to be \nreviewed.\u201d Applicant replied to Department Counsel\u2019s request on January 2, 2024, \nstating, \u201cI feel that I have made significant progress and that I do not require a hearing. I \nelect not to attend a hearing.\u201d Accordingly, this case will be decided based on the written \nrecord. The email communication between Department Counsel and Applicant is included \nin the record as Hearing Exhibit I. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s earlier request, Department Counsel submitted the \nDepartment\u2019s written case to him on March 7, 2023. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was provided to Applicant, who received the \nfile on March 13, 2023. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit any additional \ninformation. The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2023. Based upon a review of the \npleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 57 years old, divorced from his third wife, and has one adult child and \none adult stepchild. He served in the United States Navy from 1992 to 2017, retiring as a \nsenior chief petty officer (E-8). He has been employed by a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2018 and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment.

He also had one foreclosure \nof a time share. The existence and amount of these debts is supported by his admissions \nto three SOR allegations in his Answer and by credit reports dated April 14, 2022; August \n22, 2022; and March 6, 2023. They are also confirmed by Applicant\u2019s answers during an \ninterview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that was \nheld on December 6, 2021. (Items 4, 5, 6, and 7.) \nApplicant stated in his Answer, \u201cThe condition which resulted in my financial \nhardship as alleged in the Statement of Reasons were [sic] largely beyond my control, as \nit resulted from my separation and subsequent divorce. I have acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances and worked to ensure all outstanding financial problems are resolved.\u201d \n(Item 2 at 4.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant denied owing $11,777 for a judgment to a creditor. He stated in his \nAnswer that he had paid the creditor $12,072 on November 14, 2022. No documentary \nproof of this payment was provided by him. This debt appears on the April 14, 2022 (Item \n5 at 4); and August 22, 2022 (Item 6 at 2-3) credit reports. The debt does not appear on \nthe most recent credit report in the record, dated March 6, 2023 (Item 7). As set forth \nbelow, Applicant\u2019s statements about payments to other creditors are supported by \ndocumentation. That fact provides support for his statement that he paid this debt as well. \nBased on the state of the record, I find by a preponderance of the evidence Applicant \nresolved this former debt. \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing $16,566 for a delinquent credit card debt. He further \nstated that he has been making $388 monthly payments towards this debt since October \n2020. Support for this statement is found in the March 6, 2023 credit report. That report \nshows a reduced balance for the debt and that the last payment was in March 2023. (Item \n7 at 8.) This debt is being resolved by mutually agreed payments. \n1.c. Applicant denied owing a charged-off debt to a creditor in the amount of \n$9,855. The latest credit report in the record states, \u201cAccount paid for less than full \nbalance, paid charge off.\u201d (Item 7 at 12,) This debt has been resolved. \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $21,068 for a charged-off account. In his\nAnswer he stated that a third party now held the account.

He stated in his Answer \nthat he had reached a payment arrangement with this creditor and had paid the debt in \nNovember 2022. The latest credit report in the record states, \u201cAccount paid for less than \nfull balance, paid charge off.\u201d (Item 7 at 11,) This debt has been resolved. \n1.f. Applicant denied owing $10,103 for a charged-off debt. He stated in his Answer \nthat he had reached a payment arrangement with this creditor and had paid the debt in \nNovember 2022. The latest credit report in the record states, \u201cAccount paid for less than \nfull balance, paid charge off.\u201d (Item 7 at 11,) This debt has been resolved. \n1.g. Applicant denied owing $7,689 for a charged-off debt. He stated in his Answer \nthat he had reached a payment arrangement with this creditor and had paid the debt in \nNovember 2022. The latest credit report in the record states, \u201cAccount paid for less than \nfull balance, paid charge off.\u201d (Item 7 at 10,) This debt has been resolved. \n1.h. Applicant admitted that he had a timeshare foreclosed on in 2022 for failure to \nmake monthly payments. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had incurred approximately $80,000 in past-due indebtedness over the \nlast several years. The debts were unresolved at the time the SOR was issued. He also \nrecently had a foreclosure of a timeshare. These facts establish prima facie support for \nthe foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe evidence establishes that all the above mitigating conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s debt situation. His recent divorce had a deleterious impact on his finances, \nincluding the timeshare foreclosure, but he has worked hard to resolve the resulting \nissues. He has paid or otherwise resolved six of the seven past-due debts that are of \nconcern to the Government. One debt, 1.d, remained unresolved as of the date he \nanswered the SOR. However, Applicant showed a sustained track record of making \npayments towards his other past-due debts in fulfillment of payment arrangements. Under \nthe circumstances of this case, that evidence supports a finding that Applicant can be \nrelied upon to resolve the remaining debt, if he has not already done so. Paragraph 1 is \nfound for Applicant. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that \nhe has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is \nthat an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at a \ntime. (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns over his past-due indebtedness. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or \nduress has been vitiated. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt \nas to his suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

On March \n20, 2023, he amended his election and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge with the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The Government did \nnot object to his request, and the matter was converted to a hearing. The case was \nassigned to me on December 5, 2023. The hearing was convened as scheduled on \nFebruary 13, 2024. I received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on February 21, 2024. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEvidence \nI admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified but did not offer any documents in evidence. At Applicant\u2019s request \nand without objection, I left the record open until February 23, 2024, for the parties to \nprovide post-hearing documentation. Applicant timely provided Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA and B, which I admitted without objection. \nOn the Government\u2019s motion, and without objection, I took administrative notice \nof certain facts about the country conditions in the Islamic Republic of Iran and its \nrelationship with the United States, as contained in official U.S. Government documents \n(HE I). Those facts are summarized in the official government documents, so I will not \nrecite them verbatim here, but I will expound upon them in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen. He has an employment offer \nfrom a U.S. defense contractor that is conditioned upon his being granted security \nclearance eligibility. He was born in Iran to Iranian parents. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nand a master\u2019s degree from an Iranian university. He was working toward his Doctor of \nPhilosophy (PhD) degree at an Iranian university, but he was \u201cfired\u201d from the program \nbecause he practices a religion not authorized by the Iranian government. Applicant first \ncame to the United States in 2011. He was assisted in this effort by the Hebrew \nImmigrant Aid Society (HIAS). (Tr. 23-27, 31-33, 42, 51-52; GE 1-3) \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2017. He solely holds U.S. \ncitizenship, as he renounced his Iranian citizenship in 2017. He has been married and \ndivorced twice. His first marriage was to an Iranian woman from 2008 until 2014. They \nwere married in Iran and divorced shortly after entering the United States. His second \nmarriage was to a U.S. citizen from 2019 until August 2021. From his first marriage, he \nhas a 14-year-old child, who is a dual U.S. and Iranian citizen and who resides with him \nin the United States. (Tr. 23-27, 31-33, 42, 51-52; GE 1-3) \nApplicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), sister (SOR \u00b6 1.b), three brothers (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \nand several aunts and uncles (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are citizens and residents of Iran. All these \nfamily members, except for one of his brothers, are in various stages of emigrating from \nIran to come to the United States. Applicant is not aware of the whereabouts of this one \nbrother. He has not seen or been in contact with this brother after the Iranian Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) abducted this brother without charge in 2003. (Tr. \n29-30, 36-42, 54-61; GE 1-3; AE A, B) \nApplicant and the rest of his family members listed in the SOR have left or are in \nthe process of leaving Iran with the assistance of HIAS because they are part of a \nreligious minority in Iran. As a result of their religious beliefs, the Iranian government \nhas repeatedly and consistently violated their human rights. In addition to his brother \nbeing abducted, his now-deceased father was arrested without charge. Also, in about \n2007, the IRGC arrested Applicant for playing unapproved religious music in a public \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsquare and held him in jail for several days. A few weeks later, the IRGC took him from \nhis workplace and held him in a cage in an unknown location for several weeks without \ncharge. The IRGC tortured him physically and psychologically and repeatedly \nthreatened to kill him. (Tr. 27-42, 44-46, 50, 54, 66-69; GE 1-3; AE A, B) \nWhen the IRGC finally released Applicant, one of their members told Applicant \nthat it would be best for him to leave the country but took his passport and told him he \nhad to buy it back. Without his passport, Applicant could not leave and was subjected to \nfurther abuse such as receiving threatening phone calls and having his vehicle \ndamaged. In the meantime, Applicant applied with HIAS for assistance to leave Iran for \nthe United States. In 2011, two days before he was scheduled to leave Iran with HIAS\u2019s \nassistance, he bought back his passport for $20,000. When he asked the individual to \nwhom he paid for his passport if it was valid, the individual responded that it was valid \nbecause the Iranian Government wanted him to leave. (Tr. 31, 33-38, 42-45; GE 3) \nApplicant, his ex-wife, and his daughter left on a flight for Vienna, but were not \nsure if the Iranian Government would stop the plane until a flight attendant announced \nthat they were in Austrian airspace. He flew to the United States after staying for about \nfive months in Vienna while finalizing his U.S. immigration paperwork. The entire \nprocess of working with HIAS until he came to the United States took a little under three \nmonths. He has not been back to Iran since then and has vowed never to go back \nagain. He has not received any threats or been contacted by the Iranian Government \nafter he came to the United States, but the Iranian Government has continued to target, \nharass, and intimidate his family members that remain in Iran. Suspected members of \nthe IRGC also caused Applicant\u2019s family to close their business by repeatedly targeting \nit for theft and vandalism. (Tr. 31, 42-45, 47-48, 53-54, 60, 66-69; GE 3) \nApplicant described the process that HIAS is using to assist him and his family \nmembers. After obtaining a sponsor in the United States and applying for immigration to \nthe United States, HIAS provides its enrollees with a case number. HIAS then works \nwith U.S. immigration officials to facilitate their entry into the United States. Once that \nprocess reaches a certain point, each enrollee must pay HIAS $3,100, which it will later \ngive back to the enrollee so that the enrollee has enough resources to support \nthemselves in the United States. After an enrollee pays the money, HIAS books a flight \nfor them to leave Iran for the United States via either Croatia or Vienna. It is unclear \nhow long this process normally takes. (Tr. 44-49, 54-60; GE 2, 3; AE A, B) \nGiven U.S. immigration policy from early 2017 until early 2021, the HIAS program \nfrom Iran was paused and only recently began again. Applicant\u2019s mother and sister first \napplied for relocation to the United States with HIAS in 2015. They have each paid the \n$3,100 and they are scheduled to fly to Croatia in early March 2024, where Applicant \nwill meet them and assist with his elderly mother. Applicant expects that they will stay a \nfew days in Croatia finalizing paperwork before coming to the United States. (Tr. 44-49, \n54-60; GE 2, 3; AE A, B) \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s brothers that are listed in the SOR have case numbers from \nHIAS, as well. They first applied for relocation in 2017.

They are \nbeing sponsored by U.S. citizens who live in the United States. They have not received \nflight information, nor have they paid the required $3,100. However, they have the \nrequired money to provide when it is requested. It is not clear when or whether they will \nleave Iran, but they intend to do so. (Tr. 60-62; GE 1-3; AE A, B) \nApplicant has not seen any of his family members in Iran in about 14 years. He \ndoes not often communicate with them because he is worried the Iranian Government \ncould be monitoring them and cause them trouble. In addition to his daughter, he has an \nolder sister, nieces and nephews, many cousins, and an aunt and uncle who are \ncitizens and residents of the United States. While he does not currently own real \nproperty in Iran or in the United States, he has a bank account with a U.S. based bank \nwith about $30,000 in it. He also has a U.S.-based retirement account with about \n$17,000 in it. He works here and he is a member of a U.S.-based linguists\u2019 organization. \n(Tr. 46, 53, 63-66; GE 1-3) \nApplicant considers himself an American and does not identify as Iranian. He has \nnever been associated with the Iranian Government. He attempted to join the U.S. \nmilitary but could not for health reasons. He applied to work for another government \nagency, but it did not hire him. It was clear from his testimony that he has nothing but \ncontempt for the current Iranian regime. He is not looking for more money by attempting \nto be hired for this new job, and he will be making about the same amount as with his \ncurrent job. He wants to obtain a security clearance and work this new job as a way of \nshowing his loyalty to the United States, and showing his gratitude for the freedoms that \nliving here has afforded him. He has not told any of his family that he is attempting to \nobtain a security clearance. (Tr. 51-53, 70-71; GE 1-3) \nRepublic of Iran \nIn HE I, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nabout the United States' relations with Iran and the current conditions in that country. I \ntake administrative notice of the information contained in those documents including, \nbut not limited to: \nIran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic political system. \nShia clergy and political leaders vetted by the clergy dominate key power structures in \nthe country. Iran's Supreme Leader is the head of state and holds constitutional \nauthority over the judiciary, government-run media, and other important institutions. \nThe U.S. Department of State advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to \nthe risk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens.

Its \nsupport of terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East creates instability in the \nregion.

As of 2018, all previously \nsuspended sanctions imposed on Iran were reinstated with the goals of permanently \npreventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, ceasing Iran's development of ballistic \nmissiles, and ending Iran's broad range of malign activities. \nThe U.S. Department of State has identified significant human rights issues in \nIran. The issues include unlawful and arbitrary killings by the Iranian Government or its \nagents; forced disappearances attributed to the government; torture and inhumane \ntreatment by the government and its agents; the imprisonment of political opponents; \nsevere restrictions on free expression and the media; serious restrictions on political \nparticipation; and government corruption. (HE I) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation's government, including its level of control, its relationship \nwith the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant's family members and foreign contacts are vulnerable to \ncoercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member or \nfriend is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence-collection operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with one or more family members living \nin Iran is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B; however, if an \napplicant has a close relationship with even one relative living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-02382 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). There \nis a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, their \nimmediate family members. \nApplicant's mother, sister, three brothers, and several aunts and uncles are \ncitizens and residents of Iran. The Iranian Government has consistently targeted \nApplicant and his family with serious human rights violations because of their religious \nbeliefs and religious practices. Applicant's connection to his Iranian family members \nresiding in Iran presents a potential conflict of interest. The administratively noticed \ncountry conditions in Iran, such as its religious based autocratic rule, its dire human-\nrights record, and its willingness to target U.S. interests and personnel with violence and \ncyberattacks, raise these security concerns to the level of a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Application of the AG is \nnot a comment on an applicant's patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people \nmay act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a \nloved one, such as a family member. (ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2009)). AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nCountry conditions in Iran and its government\u2019s hostility towards the U.S. \nGovernment and citizens raise security concerns to the level of a heightened risk. \nApplicant has several close family members in Iran. While he does not necessarily \nmaintain close and frequent contact with them, this lack of contact is because he cares \nabout them and fears for their safety; not because he is not close to them or does not \ncare deeply about them. He has not provided sufficient evidence to rebut the \npresumption that he has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his immediate family \nmembers. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s family members listed in the SOR are known by the Iranian \nGovernment and that regime has subjected and continues to subject his family to \nhorrific human rights abuses. Prospective targeting of family members residing in a \nforeign country controlled by an authoritarian government that engages in human rights \nabuses is a security concern. Here, there is actual targeting by such a government. \nWhile he has established a life here in the United States and clearly has loyalties here, I \ndo not find that those loyalties are stronger than his bonds with his family, such that he \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. I acknowledge that \nhis family members want to flee Iran and are in the process of doing so. However, while \nthey remain there, I do not find that any of the Guideline B mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. While circumstances may \nchange in the future for Applicant if things go as planned and his relevant family \nmembers relocate from Iran to the United States, I cannot decide this matter based \nupon those possibilities. I note that this decision may seem harsh considering how the \nIranian Government has mistreated Applicant and his family. Unfortunately, this poor \ntreatment tends to work against him, as it provides actual as opposed to theoretical \nevidence of the Iranian Government\u2019s willingness and ability to mistreat him and his \nfamily. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(GE 2) \nApplicant provided different information at his hearing. He asserted that he was \nonly involved with two women between 2014 and 2017, Ms. B and his wife. He testified \nthat he met Ms. B online in about 2014. Ms. B is a citizen and resident of the \nPhilippines. He stated that they maintained a friendly relationship that was not sexual. \nThey never met in person. He sent her about $1,000 to help her have \u201ca better life.\u201d He \nfelt that she was looking for a romantic relationship. He did not share her feelings and \nended the relationship in about 2016. He admitted in his SOR response that she \u201cmay \non occasion (at most 15 times) sent illicit sexual pictures via instant messages,\u201d but it \nhappened before he and his wife married. He initially testified that they never shared \nany naked pictures. He stated that the investigator must have misreported the \ninformation. After it was pointed out that the information was not from the ROI, but from \nhis response to the SOR, he admitted receiving some pictures from Ms. B, but he never \nreciprocated. His wife stated that Applicant told him of his contacts with Ms. B before \nthey married. She wrote that he \u201chas been a 100% faithful and caring husband during \n[their] marriage.\u201d (Tr. at 73-78, 107-108, 113-115; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, \n2; AE F) \nApplicant testified that he chatted with a few women on the dating website where \nhe met his wife, but never became serious with any of them, and their chats were not \nsexual in nature. He asserted he never sent any money to any foreign women besides \nhis wife and Ms. B. He stated that he told the interviewer that he met his wife through a \nstandard online dating site, and the investigator misconstrued that statement to be an \nadmission that he participated in online sexual liaisons with women from Thailand and \nthe Philippines. (Tr. at 71-73, 78-79, 97-113; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant was evaluated at his own expense by a licensed clinical psychologist \nwith extensive experience in sexual matters and disorders. The psychologist wrote in \nhis report about Ms. B that \u201c[t]hey exchanged nonsexual pictures with each other, never \ntalked sexually, and from time to time, she asked for help paying some expenses.\u201d He \nconcluded that Applicant \u201chas no diagnosable mental health conditions, including any \nsexual disorders, and he does not need any treatment.\u201d Applicant testified that he did \nnot tell the psychologist about the explicit pictures from Ms. B because he \u201cdidn\u2019t recall\u201d \nthe pictures. (Tr. at 115; AE I, J) \nI did not find Applicant credible.

The witnesses and authors \npraised him for his loyalty to the United States, trustworthiness, honesty, \nprofessionalism, reliability, work ethic, dedication, and integrity. (Tr. at 20-38; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B-F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest; and  \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nApplicant\u2019s wife, stepchild, and in-laws are citizens and residents of Thailand. \nThailand is a close ally of the United States. There was no evidence presented that it \ncommits espionage against the United States. Applicant\u2019s family and small bank \naccount in Thailand do not create a potential conflict of interest or a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), and 7(f) have not been raised by those foreign connections. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d are concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant was living overseas from 2014 to 2017 when he had online sexual \nliaisons with women from Thailand and the Philippines. He admitted in his background \ninterview that he thought they were sex workers, and he sent them about $1,000 a \nmonth. He was in a relationship with his wife at the time and married her in 2016. His \nconduct made him vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, and coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(i) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not had any ongoing contact with the foreign women after 2017. I \nfind that his foreign ties are outweighed by his deep and long-standing relationships and \nloyalties in the United States. It is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the United States and the interests of Thailand or the \nPhilippines. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are \napplicable. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \nApplicant was arrested in December 1997 and charged with the felony offenses \nof child molestation and deviate sexual assault of a minor. He had online sexual liaisons \nwith women from Thailand and the Philippines, who he described as sex workers. He \nadmitted in his background interview that he sent them about $1,000 a month. He was \nin a relationship with his wife at the time and married her in 2016. His conduct reflected \na lack of judgment and made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nThe 1997 charges were nolle pros in 1998. Applicant adamantly denied \ncommitting any kind of sexual assault or indecent act upon his daughter. He stated that \nhis ex-wife made the complaint in order to gain a custody advantage. There is no police \nreport in evidence to counter his assertions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b) and 13(c) are applicable to \nthat conduct. \nApplicant asserted that he was only involved with two foreign women between \n2014 and 2017, Ms. B and his wife. He stated that he chatted with a few women on the \ndating website where he met his wife, but never became serious with any of them, and \ntheir chats were not sexual in nature. He asserted he never sent any money to any \nforeign women besides Ms. B and his wife. He stated that the interviewer misconstrued \nhis statement that he met his wife through a standard online dating site to his having \nparticipated in online sexual liaisons with women from Thailand and the Philippines. \nApplicant responded to DoD interrogatories in which he was asked to \nauthenticate the ROI of his background interview. He corrected six parts of the ROI, and \nhe submitted additional information, none of which had anything to do with the \nparagraphs about his online sexual liaisons with sex workers from Thailand and the \nPhilippines, which were not corrected. I did not find Applicant credible. I find the ROI to \nbe far more reliable than Applicant\u2019s version of the events. I further find that his \ntestimony was intentionally false. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge his \nmisconduct or accept responsibility for it seriously undercuts a finding that the applicant \nhas mitigated his misconduct.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 22-00761 at 6 (Jun. 13, 2024). \nSince I cannot trust Applicant\u2019s testimony, I cannot find that problematic sexual behavior \nis unlikely to recur. It continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficiently applicable to \nmitigate sexual behavior security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and D in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s work for defense contractors in support of the U.S. military, his injury \nsustained while doing so, and his favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline B, but he did not mitigate security \nconcerns under Guideline D. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z, which he denied. He is 39 years old, married, and he has a three-year-old daughter. He graduated from high school in 2004 and earned an associate degree in 2006.

During his periods of unemployment, as previously discussed, he did not \nhave medical insurance. He incurred additional medical expenses related to the birth of \nhis daughter in 2021. His spouse took a leave of absence from her job as a high-school \nteacher, where she earned approximately $40,000 to $43,000 annually, so she could care \nfor their child.

He also hired another attorney to pursue \nthe issue with his spouse\u2019s car, as it was supposed to be covered under warranty. He \nalso placed his family on his medical insurance at a cost of $800 monthly. He stated he \nrecently paid the medical debts associated with his spouse\u2019s birth of their daughter.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of \u201ccompromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. He also failed to file his \nrelevant federal and state income tax returns, as required. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) \nare established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, including a head-on car accident and \nrelated medical expenses, contributed to his debts. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder his circumstances. He enrolled his defaulted student loans in the ED\u2019s Fresh Start \ninitiative in February 2024, and the most recent CBR reflects that his loans are no longer \ndelinquent. When payments commence under the initiative, he has allotted between $300 \nand $500 of his monthly net remainder to repay his student loans. He also filed his federal \nand state income tax return for TY 2018 in April 2022, he filed his federal income tax \nreturn for TY 2019 in January 2023, and he filed his state income tax returns for TYs \n2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 in December 2023. As such, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.z \nin his favor, and I also find SOR \u00b6 1.y, in part, in his favor.  \nApplicant has not submitted evidence of responsible conduct for his remaining \nfinancial issues. He did not submit proof of payments toward his medical debts alleged in \nthe SOR or of his efforts to locate two of his medical creditors. He did not provide \ndocumentation reflecting he filed his federal income tax returns for TYs 2020, 2021, and \n2022, that he paid his outstanding federal and state taxes for TY 2018, or that he paid his \noutstanding state taxes for TYs 2020, 2021, and 2022. \nAlthough Applicant has received financial counseling and his monthly net \nremainder reflects that he has the financial means to pay his medical debts and his \noutstanding taxes, he needs more time to establish he has his finances under control. I \nfind that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e) and 20(g) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c-1.x or, in part, to SOR \u00b6 1.y. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.y \nFor Applicant, in part (filed federal \nincome tax returns for tax years \n2018 and 2019), and Against \nApplicant, in part (failure to file \nfederal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2020 and 2021) \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 13-41; AE B) \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, including 11 federal student loans totaling \n$32,604, and two medical debts totaling $433. The status of the allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k and 1.n are 11 federal student loans placed for collection for \n$32,604. Applicant reported that in 2021, she tried to get her student loans resolved by \nlooking at the Department of Education (DoE) website. She stated that it was confusing, \nand she could not figure out what to do. She did not contact DOE, the lender, or anyone \nelse for assistance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts are small and do not appear to be part of a larger pattern \nof delinquent debt or financial irresponsibility. I find the medical debts do not represent a \nsecurity concern. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m. are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe other debts alleged in the SOR are established by the credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k and 1.n. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged student loans are being paid or otherwise resolved, or \nbecame delinquent under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur.

Applicant\u2019s difficulty finding sufficient employment in \nher field after graduation and having her work hours curtailed by her employer are \ncircumstances beyond her control. However, she failed to provide sufficient evidence \nshowing that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. The DoE website may have \nbeen hard to navigate in 2021, however, she has a college degree, and should have been \nable to contact someone at the DoE, the lender, or find some way to get assistance from \nanother source to get her loans out of a collection status.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 50 years old. He was married in 1989 and divorced in 2008. He remarried in 2010 and has two adult children and one adult step-child. He attended some college from 1991 through 1996.

After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old. He was married in 1989 and divorced in 2008. He \nremarried in 2010 and has two adult children and one adult step-child. He attended \nsome college from 1991 through 1996. He returned to college in 2014 and completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. From about 2003 through 2016, he worked as a director of \nworship in a church. In April 2015, he began working part-time with his current \nemployer. In 2016, he switched to full-time with his employer and continued to work \npart-time as an independent contractor for the church. In 2023, he changed positions \nwith his current employer to business development. He also described earning a small \namount of income from royalties he collects from his work as a musician. (GX 1, 3; \nTr. 17-25, 41-44) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years (TYs) 2018, 2019 and 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) and that he owed \ndelinquent taxes of $3,409 for TY 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $3,368 for TY 2019 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e). The allegations are established by his admissions, his responses to \ninterrogatories, and by various IRS and state tax documents. (GX 1-4) \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues began with TY 2018 when he tried to deduct additional \nexpenses from his part-time work for the church as an independent contractor while he \nwas full-time with his current employer. In early 2019, Applicant hired an individual to \nprepare his TY 2018 federal and state income tax filings. That person was slow to \nrequest necessary information from Applicant and Applicant was slow to respond. He \ntestified that, as the deadline drew near, \u201cthere [were] additional things that they were \nasking for that I did not have at the time \u2026 I became frustrated with the preparer, and \nwe missed the filing deadline, and it continued to drag on into the summer, into the fall, \nand I did not file an extension. They didn't even recommend that I file an extension.\u201d At \nan unspecified date, he hired another tax preparer who, similarly, was unable to \ncomplete his TY 2018 filing. He testified then, \u201cI tried to do it myself and tried to put my \nhead through a wall, trying to figure it all out.\u201d (GX 1-3; Tr. 24, 39-43, 48-50) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith TY 2018 unresolved, Applicant also failed to timely file his TY 2019 federal \nand state income tax returns and his tax situation began to \u201csnowball.\u201d He testified that \nhe began to look for another tax preparer that would be more responsive, but also \nadmitted that he procrastinated during this period out of frustration over the process. \n(GX 1-3; Tr. 42-45) \nApplicant disclosed both delinquent tax returns in his November 2020 SCA and \nstated that he \u201cexpect[ed] the situation to be resolved before January 2021.\u201d However, \nhe then failed to file his TY 2020 return on time. He hired a new tax preparer in late \n2021. In December 2021, he filed his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2018, \n2019 and 2020. (GX 1-3; Tr. 42, 48-54) \nFederal tax account transcripts, printed in October 2022, reflect that Applicant \nreceived penalties for the late filing of his TYs 2018, 2019 and 2020 income tax returns \nand that he owed about $6,784 in delinquent federal taxes for TYs 2018 and 2019. \nApplicant did not owe any additional taxes for TY 2020. An installment agreement was \nestablished in June 2022 where Applicant would pay $75 per month. However, \ndocuments only show a $44 payment made in August 2022 and a $75 payment made in \nSeptember 2022. He testified that payments were ongoing but did not provide any \nadditional payment records. (GX 2-3; Tr. 21, 27-28) \nAlthough Applicant claimed to have continued working with the tax preparer, he \nfailed to timely file his TY 2021 and TY 2022 federal and state income tax returns. At the \nhearing, he testified that his work as an independent contractor as well as royalties he \ncollected from his music again complicated his income tax returns. He also described \ndifficulties in communicating with the tax preparer as a cause for the delays. He \nswitched to another tax preparer in early 2023 and was scheduled to meet with her the \nday after the hearing to finalize his TY 2021 and TY 2022 income tax returns. He \ntestified that this new tax preparer was great to work with and he intended to retain her \nservices to prepare his TY 2023 and future income tax returns. (GX 4; Tr. 37-40, 52-55) \nOutside of his delinquent tax filings and back taxes owed, Applicant had no other \nfinancial issues. Based on his salary, his work as an independent contractor and a small \namount of royalties, he estimated that he earned about $135,000 to $140,000 annually \nand was able to meet his monthly expenditures. (GX 1, 3; Tr. 44-46) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes one condition that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19 potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TYs \n2018, 2019 and 2021. Records reflect that he owes about $6,784 in back taxes for TYs \n2018 and 2019. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThere are several pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nWhile difficulty in meeting financial obligations may force an applicant to choose \nthe order in which he or she addresses unpaid debts, they do not provide a plausible \nexcuse for failing to meet an important legal requirement, such as filing tax returns when \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndue. ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017) Failure to file tax returns \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem complying with well-established governmental \nrules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TYs \n2018, 2019 and 2021 as alleged in the SOR. He referenced several reasons for his \ndelay including the need to submit a complicated income tax return based on \ndeductions he wanted to take as a part-time independent contractor as well as his \ninability to hire competent tax preparers. However, he also admitted that his own \nfrustration and procrastination played a part in the delayed filings. Although he stated in \nhis November 2020 SCA that he was committed to resolving his TY 2018 and TY 2019 \nfederal and state income tax filings by January 2021, he did not submit the returns until \nDecember 2021. Additionally, as of the November 2023 hearing, Applicant still had not \nfiled his TY 2021 federal and state income tax returns. \nApplicant also acknowledged that he owed back taxes for TYs 2018 and 2019. \nWhile there is evidence in the record that an installment agreement was established in \nJune 2022, documents only show two payments occurring after that agreement, through \nSeptember 2022. Applicant did not provide any additional documentary evidence of \npayments. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s tax concerns were not limited to TYs 2018, 2019 and \n2021. He also failed to timely file his TY 2020 federal and state income tax returns and, \nas of the hearing date, still had not filed his TY 2022 federal and state income tax \nreturns. These additional tax issues were not alleged in the SOR. However, they \nestablish a history of non-compliance with tax obligations that undercut assertions of \nmitigation, since his tax problems are recent and ongoing. \nWhile Applicant appeared motivated to resolve his tax issues and has otherwise \nmaintained sound financial circumstances, his inability to consistently meet his federal \nand state income tax obligations continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. He has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or established that he will be able to maintain \ncompliance with his future tax obligations. None of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are \nfully applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nBeginning with TY 2018, Applicant struggled to collect the necessary documents \nto submit a complicated income tax return. A combination of poor service from his tax \npreparers and his own procrastination allowed the issue to \u201csnowball\u201d into several years \nof delayed tax filings and back taxes owed. Although he testified to finally finding a tax \npreparer capable of timely managing his filings and reiterated his own commitment to \ntimely addressing his future tax obligations, he failed to establish a track record of tax \ncompliance. His struggles to meet this annual obligation raise unmitigated questions \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

He claimed he filed his federal income \ntax returns through TY 2021. He was asked to provide copies of his IRS account \ntranscripts for TY 2015 through 2021; however, he provided IRS wage and income \ntranscripts.

He did not provide \nan updated account transcript after the hearing.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or  \notherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues are current, ongoing, and frequent. He testified his tax issues \nstarted in approximately 2000. When the record closed, he failed to prove that he filed his \nfederal income tax returns for TYs 2013, 2014, and 2018. Additionally, the documentation \nin the record indicates he owes the IRS approximately $2,288 for TYs 2016, 2017, and \n2018. His failure to file his federal income tax returns in a timely manner over several \nyears, make payments, or establish a payment plan with the IRS reflects a lack of \nresponsibility, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAccording to Applicant, his tax issues are the result, in part, of withdrawals from \nretirement plans. However, he has not demonstrated he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to address and resolve his self-created tax issues in a timely manner. He \nprovided documentation he resolved two of his non-tax related debts; therefore, AG \u00b6(d) \napplies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1g. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(g) was not \nestablished for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant failed to file and pay his federal income tax returns in a timely \nmanner between 2013 and 2020, and to resolve these issues after the SOR was issued. \nOverall, he has not demonstrated the actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy \nperson. I conclude he did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f - 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant had criminal and disciplinary problems before and during his service in \nthe military, primarily alcohol related. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and \nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was arrested for DUI in October 2015. SOR \u00b6 \n1.d alleges that Applicant was counseled for that DUI by the military. They both allege \nthe same underlying conduct. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR \nunder the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\n1.d is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was counseled for failing to comply with his \nmilitary branch\u2019s tattoo policy. Applicant was not disciplined, and he was not given an \nunfavorable administrative action. His tattoos were photographed and entered as a \ncounseling entry in his military record for administrative and identification purposes. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant, \u201cwithout consent, grabbed the penis and \ntesticles of another [servicemember] twice in a 45-minute period.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges \nthat: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn or around May 2019 you were counseled for violating Articles 128 on\ntwo counts for being Drunk and Disorderly, due to an alcohol related\nincident where you were accused of sexually assaulting a coworker\u2019s\ngenitals on two occasions. As a result of this incident, you were given a\nGeneral Discharge from the [military branch]. \n \n \n \n \nThere are several problems with this allegation. Applicant did not receive a \ngeneral discharge; he was honorably discharged. Article 128 of the UCMJ is the assault \narticle, not the drunk and disorderly article. Finally, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h both allege the \nassault on another servicemember\u2019s genitals. Because SOR \u00b6 1.h also alleges that the \nassault was alcohol related, whereas SOR \u00b6 1.g only alleges the assault, I am finding \nSOR \u00b6 1.g as the duplicate allegation and concluding SOR \u00b6 1.g for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant falsified information during his July 2021 \nbackground interview when he \u201cstated that a coworker claimed you \u2018tapped him on the \ngenitals\u2019 when in fact [Applicant] engaged in the conduct alleged in subparagraph 1.g \nabove,\u201d which alleged that Applicant \u201cwithout consent, grabbed the penis and testicles \nof another [servicemember] twice in a 45-minute period.\u201d Applicant does not remember \ntapping or grabbing the genitals of the other servicemember because of the alcohol, but \nhe does not deny that it likely occurred. I do not find that Applicant intentionally provided \na false description of the incident to the background investigator. AG \u00b6 16(b) is not \napplicable. SOR \u00b6 1.i is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s problematic conduct was primarily alcohol related. He had two DUIs, \nmost recently in 2015, and he got drunk at a formal military function in May 2019, \nblacked out, and tapped or grabbed another servicemember\u2019s genitals. I do not believe \nApplicant did that for sexual gratification. I do not mean to downplay the conduct, as \nthere is a victim involved, but I believe it was an immature, degrading, and possibly \nhurtful form of humor. It is likely the military agreed because Applicant was not punished \nfor the conduct, and he was honorably discharged. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant regrets his problematic conduct, particularly his alcohol-related \nincidents. It has been more than five years since his last incident. He has matured and \nreduced his drinking. He has three young children, and he coaches two youth-soccer \nclubs. He credibly testified that he has not driven after consuming alcohol since his \n2015 DUI. I find that problematic conduct is unlikely to recur, and it no longer casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The above mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The debts are listed on one or more credit reports from \nNovember 2020, December 2021, August 2022, and September 2023. \nAll four credit reports list the for $19,547 charged-off joint auto loan alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. The last payment was made in July 2017. The two most recent credit \nreports include the comment: \u201cConsumer Disputes After Resolution.\u201d Applicant denied \nresponsibility for the debt. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4, 12) \nApplicant stated that he did not report this debt on the Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) he submitted in October 2020 because he was not \nresponsible for the loan. He discussed the loan during his background interview in \nDecember 2020. The unauthenticated, and therefore less reliable, report of investigation \nof Applicant\u2019s background interview indicated that Applicant told the investigator that he \ndiscovered the loan when he applied for a mortgage about a month after he submitted \nthe SF 86. He stated that his ex-wife took the loan out partially in his name without his \nconsent or knowledge, and he did not cosign for the loan. He stated that he planned to \ncontact his ex-wife and ask her to pay the debt, which he did not expect her to do. He \nalso told the investigator that he had been separated from his ex-wife for a very long \ntime before his divorce. He stated that if she did not pay the debt, he would contact the \ncreditor and set up a settlement arrangement for the debt. He stated that he intended to \naddress the debt sometime in 2021. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 11) \nApplicant testified at his hearing that it was an ex-girlfriend who presumably took \nout the loan, not his ex-wife. He indicated that after they broke up, the ex-girlfriend \nmoved to a state where he never lived. His credit report listed that an address in that \nstate was reported in November 2018. The credit report also listed that Applicant had \nanother auto loan in his name alone from September 2016 through February 2018. He \nsubmitted a letter from the auto financing company purportedly to show that he did not \nhave an account with the company. However, the September 2022 response from the \ncompany indicated they were responding to Applicant\u2019s inquiry dated September 20, \n2022, \u201crequesting the removal of an [auto financing company] credit inquiry from [his] \ncredit report issued by one or more credit reporting agencies.\u201d The company indicated it \nwas unable to locate any information about Applicant in their records and requested \nadditional information such as his full name and the last four digits of his Social Security \nnumber. Applicant never responded to the request for additional information. He stated \nthat he read the letter as indicating the company was unable to locate his account.

(Tr. at 33-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 11) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his March 2015 Declaration \nfor Federal Employment when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked: \u201cDuring the \nlast 7 years, have you been convicted, been imprisoned, been on probation, or been on \nparole? (Includes felonies, firearms or explosives violations, misdemeanors, and all \nother offenses.)\u201d Applicant was arrested for DWI in 2007, which was beyond the seven-\nyear period, but his conviction in September 2009 should have been reported. Applicant \ndenied intentionally providing false information on the declaration. He stated he thought \nthe crime was beyond the reporting period. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his October 2020 SF 86 \nwhen he failed to report his 2005 felony charge under the question that asked, \u201cHave \nyou EVER been charged with any felony offense?\u201d Applicant was charged with a felony, \nbut his guilty plea in a deferred adjudication was to a misdemeanor charge of hindering \napprehension or prosecution. He was sentenced in January 2007 to probation for six \nmonths, a fine, and court costs. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d also alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his October 2020 SF \n86 when he failed to report his 2007 DWI that resulted in a 2009 conviction under the \nquestion that asked, \u201cHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or \ndrugs?\u201d Applicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He stated that he misread \nthe question to only going back ten years. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his October 2020 SF 86 \nwhen he failed to report the three delinquent debts alleged in the SOR under the \nfollowing specific questions: \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? and \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had any account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? (Include \nfinancial obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as well as those \nfor which you were a cosigner or guarantor). \nIt is unclear why those specific questions were alleged when there were other \nquestions that were more appropriate.

However, the \nGovernment did not prove that any of the alleged debts were turned over to a collection \nagency. The Government also did not prove that when Applicant submitted the SF 86, \nhe knew that he had an account that was suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed. There is insufficient evidence to establish that Applicant \nintentionally falsified the two specific questions alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \napplicable to those questions. SOR \u00b6 2.e is concluded for Applicant. \nHaving considered all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, education, \nexperience, other factors, and credible testimony, I am not convinced by substantial \nevidence that he deliberately falsified the 2015 Declaration for Federal Employment or \nthe 2020 SF 86 (including financial questions that were not alleged in the SOR). I found \nApplicant to be unsophisticated but honest. I note the criminal offenses were well known \nto the military when they occurred and did not prevent him from serving an additional six \nyears after the DWI arrest and receiving an honorable discharge. I believe his testimony \nthat he would not lie about his past because \u201cI know you guys know more about me \nthan I do, so I wasn\u2019t trying to hide nothing. I just don\u2019t remember everything.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not applicable to any of the questions on the 2015 and 2020 documents. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d are concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal offense occurred in 2007, more than 16 years ago. He \nhas since been honorably discharged and steadily employed. I find the conduct is \nunlikely to recur, and it no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. The above mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant paid two of the SOR debts in August 2021 and September 2022, which \nwas after they were discussed during his background interview. I found his testimony \nthat he does not believe he is responsible for the joint auto loan to be credible. It was \ncorroborated in part by the credit report that lists an address in a state where he never \nlived, but where his ex-girlfriend moved after they broke up. I also believe his testimony \nthat he thought the letter from the auto financing company was proof that he was not \nresponsible for the loan. Applicant found out during and after the hearing that the letter \ndoes not mean what he thought it meant. It is unclear how he will proceed, but the debt \nis old and will shortly fall off his credit report. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are otherwise in reasonable shape. He received financial \nclasses when he was in the military, but no formal financial counseling. He and his \ngirlfriend share their expenses, and his children do not live at home. Credit reports \nindicate he paid a small collection account in November 2016. Excepting the SOR \ndebts, he has not accrued any additional delinquent debts since 2016. Additional \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant\u2019s finances do not \ncast doubt on his current judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service. \nAppendix C of the adjudicative guidelines gives me the authority to grant \nconditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue information that can be partially but \nnot completely mitigated, with the provision that additional security measures shall be \nrequired to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the issues are \ncompletely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/31/2024 \nDecision \nOn September 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption, and Guideline I, psychological conditions. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017 (AG). \nOn September 20, 2022, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on January 26, 2023. A hearing was scheduled and held on March \n7, 2023. I was assigned to the case on October 16, 2024. I contacted Applicant offering \nto reopen his case for another hearing since so much time had passed. He accepted \nthe offer, and a supplemental hearing was scheduled and held on October 22, 2024. \nDuring the course of the supplemental hearing, and after completely reviewing the \nrecord from the first hearing, I stated on the record that I believed this case was \nappropriate for a Summary Disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel did not \nobject. \nThis case involves four allegations of alcohol consumption concerns under \nGuideline G, and two cross-allegations of psychological conditions concerns under \n \n \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nGuideline I. Applicant had two alcohol incidents in 2012 while attending college. In \n2015, while intoxicated, he made a suicide attempt by overdosing on prescribed \nmedication. He was admitted to a hospital and later diagnosed with Unspecified \nEpisodic Mood Disorder, Personality Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorder-moderate. In \n2021, he underwent a DOD-directed psychological evaluation, where he was again \ndiagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder-moderate, in early remission. \nApplicant credibly testified that he has been sober for over three years. His last \nalcoholic drink was in approximately August 2021, while attending a friend\u2019s wedding. \nHe acknowledged that the Alcohol Use Disorder is accurate and understands that he \ncannot drink in the future, and he is committed to that course of behavior. He also \nacknowledged that he was young and immature when the two alcohol incidents \noccurred while in college. He is an outstanding performer at work and has the full \nsupport of his wife and family in his efforts to remain sober. \nThe November 2021 psychological evaluation found that Applicant did not meet \nthe diagnostic criteria for any other mental health concerns other than the Alcohol Use \nDisorder. The evaluator offered a guarded prognosis concerning future alcohol abuse \ngiven the short amount of sobriety at the time of the evaluation (about three months). \nThat concern has been refuted by Applicant\u2019s continued sobriety of over three years. \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems and mental health no longer \ncreate doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified information. His established period of sobriety and his recognition that \nhe must abstain from alcohol in the future show maturity and a willingness to deal with \nthis condition in a straight-forward manner. In reaching these conclusions, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. This case is decided for Applicant. Clearance is granted. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n2 \n",

The venture of \nestablishing and maintaining his business eventually proved to be unsuccessful and \nbusiness-related debts (unanticipated renovations and unexpected breakdown of various \nsystems) started to develop and increase. He acknowledged that he failed to recognize \nthe pending failure sooner as he was trying to reverse the situation. (Response to SOR \nat 2) In an effort to reduce his debt, Applicant took on a second job, first within the state, \nand then in Iraq. (Tr. at 33) \nOn December 30, 2016, Applicant engaged the professional services of a debt \nrelief program under which he agreed to make monthly payments of $2,604 for a period \nof 53 months commencing in January 2017. (AE R) It remains unclear if he continued the \nprogram for an unspecified period and if any of his 18 listed creditors received any \npayments out of it. \nIn September 2017, in an effort to try to pay off his debts, totaling about $667,512,\nApplicant voluntarily filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \nAs part of the Chapter 13 process, through December 5, 2018, Applicant was paying \nabout $8,500 per month, an amount he found difficult to sustain, and he eventually paid \nthe Trustee $5,550.62 for expenses of administration ($4,009 in attorney\u2019s fees; $310 in \ncourt costs, and $1,231.62 in trustee expenses and compensation); and $30,699 (minus \n$4,510.13 that was refunded) that was paid by or on behalf of the debtor. There were \n$21,838.65 in secured principal payments and $7,799.60 in priority unsecured payments. \n(GE 3 at 24, 76-77; Tr. at 29, 35) While the Chapter 13 process was continuing, Applicant \naccepted an overseas position in Iraq.

After \nprocrastinating for some time, the conversion motion was finally filed. (GE 1 at 48; Tr. at \n35) The Order granting the conversion was granted in November 2018. (Response to \nSOR at 2; GE 3 at 9) \nApplicant\u2019s new bankruptcy attorney purportedly followed the Chapter 11 \nbankruptcy process, but at one point suggested to Applicant that they should convert the \nprocess to Chapter 7. The conversion was approved in February 2020. (GE 3 at 15; Tr. \nat 36) Applicant initially agreed but remembering the warning he had previously received \nwhen he was granted his security clearance in 2017 (AE M), he changed his mind and \ntold his attorney to withdraw the Chapter 7 request. (Response to SOR at 3) Unfortunately \nfor Applicant, he was at that time employed in Afghanistan, and he was unable to address \nthe situation with his attorney until he returned. The Chapter 7 process was dismissed on \nJune 29, 2020, not because Applicant\u2019s attorney had withdrawn it, but because no actions \nhad been taken to comply with the trustee\u2019s requirements, including Applicant\u2019s failure to \nappear for a meeting of creditors because he was still in Afghanistan. No delinquent \naccounts were discharged under Chapter 7. (GE 3 at 16; Tr. at 38) \nWhen Applicant returned from Afghanistan, he and his attorney discussed a new \nrepayment plan under which they would address each creditor individually. Applicant paid \nthis attorney over $11,000 to handle everything. He also claimed that the attorney settled \nor paid off between $60,000 and $80,000 of the debt through negotiations, but Applicant \nwas unable to obtain specific information from the attorney to verify those negotiations \nand results. (Tr. at 37, 40) Applicant also initially contended that he had personally paid \noff several debts when he refinanced his residence in 2023, but he could only identify one \nof them. (Tr. 41-43) When he responded to the SOR, Applicant was \u201cawaiting guidance \nand direction from [his] attorney as how to proceed.\u201d (Response to SOR at 3) As of the \ndate of the hearing \u2013 some 18 months later \u2013 Applicant had received no such guidance \nand direction. \nIn addition to the multiple related bankruptcy filings, the SOR alleged 12 different \nfinancial accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, totaling \napproximately $136,354, as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers Applicant\u2019s successive bankruptcy filings under Chapter 13, \nChapter 11, and Chapter 7. (GE 3; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 1) As noted above, only \nthe Chapter 13 involved verified payments made by Applicant to the Trustee and \npayments made by the Trustee to creditors. Neither the Chapter 11 nor the Chapter 7 \nwas successful. Applicant was relying on the professional advice and guidance of his \nbankruptcy attorneys, and it appears that while the first attorney was at least partially \nsuccessful, his second attorney\u2019s verifiable performance is questionable at best. The \nChapter 13 process resolved some of Applicant\u2019s financial issues as well as partially \nresolved other delinquent accounts. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a bank account with an unpaid balance of $18,638 that was \nplaced for collection and charged off.

The insufficiency of the allegation in furnishing \nnecessary specifically alleged facts enables me to conclude that the facts in the allegation \nare too general to be effectively presented. Accordingly, the allegation is concluded in \nfavor of Applicant. \nWhile not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also had other debts for which he made \nsubstantial payments under his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, including approximately $6,107 \nto the state department of revenue, and approximately $1,692 to the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS). (GE 3 at 77) Starting in September 2020, under a separate installment plan \nwith the state department of revenue, he was and is still paying them $835.34 each month \nas part of a 60-month payment plan. (Tr. at 45-46) As of March 14, 2024, he had already \ncompleted 42 payments of that plan. (AE L) \nAs of February 29, 2024, according to a Personal Financial Statement, Applicant \nreported a family monthly net income of $11,891; monthly expenses of $10,310 (including \nmortgage/rent of $3,352), leaving a remainder of about $1,581 available for saving or \nspending. He also reported actual monthly debt payments totaling $6,256, but that figure \nerroneously again included the $3,352 for mortgage/rent. As corrected, his debt payments \ntotal $1,504, leaving a true remainder of about $77. He also reported approximately \n$2,889 in bank savings, and about $28,219 in his 401K. (AE I) \nApplicant received guidance in budgeting, cash flow management, unsecured \ndebt, and debt negotiation in December 2016, and completed on-line credit and debt \ncounseling, including budget analysis, when he initially filed for bankruptcy in September \n2017.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2015, Applicant and a friend decided to open his own business \u2013 a restaurant \nand lounge with 11 employees. His partner was not an investor in the business but had \nthe expertise while Applicant was the sole investor. The venture of establishing and \nmaintaining his business eventually proved to be unsuccessful and business-related \ndebts started to develop and increase. By September 2017, his business debts totaled \nabout $667,512. In an effort to try to resolve those debts, with the assistance of attorneys, \nhe started successive bankruptcy filings under Chapter 13, Chapter 11, and Chapter 7. \nAlthough the Chapter 13 involved verified payments made by Applicant to the Trustee \nand payments made by the Trustee to creditors, neither the Chapter 11 nor the Chapter \n7 was successful, and many accounts remained delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have \nbeen established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his \ndebts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. A debt that became delinquent several \nyears ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nApplicant noted that his financial problems commenced when he tried to fulfil his dream \nof opening his own business in 2015. Before 2016, he had never had any financial \nproblems and had never even bounced a check. The start-up expenses and other \nbusiness-related expenses started mounting despite his best efforts to control them. \nWithout taking any funds from the business, he intended to live off his retirement and his \nwife\u2019s salary. He attributed his initial financial issues essentially to a combination of factors \nincluding unanticipated renovation expenses and unexpected breakdown of various \nsystems. He failed to recognize the pending business failure sooner as he was trying to \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreverse the situation. In an effort to reduce his debt, Applicant took on a second job, first \nwithin the state, and then in Iraq. \nIn December 2016, Applicant engaged the professional services of a debt relief \nprogram under which he agreed to make monthly payments of $2,604 for a period of 53 \nmonths commencing in January 2017. It remains unclear if he continued the program for \nan unspecified period and if any of his 18 listed creditors received any payments out of it. \nIn September 2017, with about $667,512 in debts, Applicant voluntarily filed for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Through December 5, 2018, \nhe made $21,838.65 in secured principal payments and $7,799.60 in priority unsecured \npayments. While the Chapter 13 process was continuing, Applicant accepted an overseas \nposition in Iraq to generate additional funds. He disengaged from his original bankruptcy \nattorney and hired a friend\u2019s attorney who recommended the bankruptcy be converted \nfrom Chapter 13 to Chapter 11. After procrastinating for some time, the conversion motion \nwas finally filed, and the conversion was granted in November 2018.  \nApplicant\u2019s new bankruptcy attorney suggested to Applicant that they should \nconvert the process to Chapter 7. The conversion was approved in February 2020. \nApplicant initially agreed but then changed his mind and told his attorney to withdraw the \nChapter 7 request. Unfortunately for Applicant, he was at that time employed in \nAfghanistan, and he was unable to address the situation with his attorney until he \nreturned. The Chapter 7 process was dismissed on June 29, 2020, not because \nApplicant\u2019s attorney had withdrawn it, but because no actions had been taken to comply \nwith the trustee\u2019s requirements, including Applicant\u2019s failure to appear for a meeting of \ncreditors because he was still in Afghanistan. No delinquent accounts were discharged \nunder Chapter 7. Upon his return from overseas, Applicant and his attorney discussed a \nnew repayment plan under which they would address each creditor individually. Applicant \npaid this attorney over $11,000 to handle everything. He also claimed that the attorney \nsettled or paid off between $60,000 and $80,000 of the debt through negotiations, but \nApplicant was unable to obtain specific information from the attorney to verify those \nnegotiations and results. Applicant also initially contended that he had personally paid off \nseveral debts when he refinanced his residence in 2023, but he could only identify one of \nthem. When he responded to the SOR, Applicant was \u201cawaiting guidance and direction \nfrom [his] attorney as how to proceed.\u201d As of the date of the hearing \u2013 some 18 months \nlater \u2013 Applicant had received no such guidance and direction. \nHowever, despite receiving questionable legal support from his second bankruptcy \nattorney, Applicant apparently had a repayment plan as far back as 2016, and there is \nverifiable documentary evidence that through his varied efforts, he initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors by making substantial \npayments for accounts that were both alleged in the SOR as well as accounts that were \nnot alleged. Of the 11 alleged delinquent accounts, not including the one for which I \nindicated the allegation was too broad with insufficient facts to consider, Applicant has \nresolved 8 such accounts. In addition, he has resolved or is in the process of resolving \nseveral identified but unalleged accounts. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board.

See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged delinquent \naccounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). In \nthis instance, Applicant commenced his resolution plan in 2016 and then took verifiable \naction under Chapter 13 in September 2017 \u2013 five years before the SOR was issued. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there are substantial voluntary \npayments to creditors as well as resolved accounts. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd.

Far more important is the \nverifiable documentary evidence of his successful efforts to resolve the eight accounts \nand his declared intentions of eventually addressing the remaining delinquent accounts. \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been as he has a small \nmonthly remainder and his delinquent debts have been reduced significantly. Applicant\u2019s \nactions for such a long period between 2016 and today, under the circumstances, no \nlonger cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See \nISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve his debts is \npositive and extremely favorable. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude that Applicant proffered substantial mitigating evidence, which was \nmore than sufficient to overcome the disqualifying conditions established under Guideline \nF. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

As a result, he assumed financial \nresponsibility for all her living expenses in Peru. Because they did not live together, she \nwould often meet Applicant at his work locations abroad.

He was required to \nreturn to the United States. Because Peru closed its borders, his wife could not return \nhome and had to remain in Colombia. Between March 2020 and June 2020, Applicant \nhad financial responsibility for his wife\u2019s financial obligations in Peru, her housing and \nliving expenses in Columbia, as well as his living expenses. Because he was not \ntraveling, he paid these obligations on his base salary, which was $99,000. (Tr. 21, 34, \n67-71) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife, who worked in the beauty industry, returned to Peru, she \nremained unable to work during the pandemic. He would visit her as often as possible. \nAfter she became pregnant, Applicant paid her prenatal and labor and delivery \nexpenses out-of-pocket, totaling $6,000. He continued to work with an immigration \nattorney to secure the immigration status his wife required to immigrate to the United \nStates. He believes he incurred approximately $2,000 in legal expenses. She \nimmigrated to the United States in September 2023. (Tr. 22, 24, 29, 37, 41, 74) \nBetween March 2020 and September 2023, Applicant supported multiple \nhouseholds, and struggled to pay his financial obligations. He stopped paying his \nconsumer credit accounts and incurred the delinquent debt alleged in the SOR. He \nengaged a credit repair company to help him rehabilitate his finances. He did not \nprovide a copy of the contract with the company describing the statement of work. It \nappears that Applicant wrote settlement offer letters to the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b. He testified that the creditors did not respond. In October 2021, he entered \ninto a settlement agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($5,502) to make 76 \npayments to resolve the debt. He did not provide any proof of payments. The credit \nreports in the record do not show any reduction of the balance owed. (Tr. 21-24, 43-\n66,73) \nSince 2019, his income has increased from $96,000 to $108,000. He also \nreceives disability income from the Department of Veterans Affairs. After paying his \nrecurring obligations, he does not have much disposable income. He has not made any \npayments toward any of the other alleged debts. (Tr. 32-33, 71; AE A-D). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk \nof having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 \n18) The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant owed \n$45,350 on six delinquent debts. The following financial considerations disqualifying \ncondition applies: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) an inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by events beyond his control \u2013 the \nunexpected economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the four years it took his \nwife to immigrate to the United States after their marriage in 2019. However, since his \nfinances stabilized with his return to full travel schedule, increases in salary, and the \nreunification of his family since his wife\u2019s immigration to the United States, he has not \ndemonstrated that he acted responsibly to repay his creditors. Although he claims to \nhave retained a credit repair company, he did not provide any evidence of the work \ndone on his behalf. The alleged debts remain unpaid, and Applicant did not present a \nplan for their repayment. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Furthermore, applicants are not held to a \nstandard of perfection. All that is required is that he develop a plan for handling his \ndelinquent accounts and executing that plan. He did not present evidence of his plans \nor efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. He is \ndivorced with two minor children; ages 11 and 13. He served in the military from 2005 \nuntil 2016 when he was honorably discharged.

He responded \u201cno.\u201d In Section 18 (Relatives), he marked the blocks for Mother and \nFather only. He did not list his two children. Applicant completed a prior SCA in October \n2014 in which his answers to Sections 18 and 26 were the same as in his August 2019 \nSCA. He stated he would not knowingly say he did not have children when he does, and \nthat he has been paying child support for both. (Items 3, 10) \nIn June 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in an \nenhanced subject interview (ESI). He volunteered that he had failed to list his two children \nand three half-siblings in both his October 2014 and August 2019 e-QIPs. He volunteered \nto the investigator that he had failed to disclose that he had multiple accounts (four or five \ncredit cards and three personal loans) that were delinquent and in collection. During his \ninterview, he specifically addressed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a & 1.n and stated he had \nadditional debts in collection. He did not disclose these debts on the SCA.

(Item 13) \nOn August 18, 2022, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. His debts were \ndischarged on November 15, 2022. In his answer to the SOR, he stated the debts alleged \nin the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.n (all except the child support arrears) were included in his \nbankruptcy filing and most were confirmed with his bankruptcy documents but not all. \nApplicant\u2019s June and September 2022 CBRs do not show these debts. As his Chapter 7 \nfiling is extensive, I find all of his debts were likely were included in the $174,000 that was \nsuccessfully discharged. Though this action resolves the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.n, they \nwere not due to his own good faith efforts.

Applicant volunteered this information when he met with the Government \ninvestigator for his June 2020 ESI. In his answer to the SOR, he states neither of these \nomissions were intentional. He further states he knows a credit report is part of the \nprocess, know he had some debts in collection and, therefore, would not have concealed \nit.

It is \nunclear how those debts were resolved, though this credit report is by now almost 10 \nyears old, it does show a history of failure to handle debts.

(Items 12 & 13) \nWhile there is no evidence of financial counseling, Applicant did hire an attorney \nto handle his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy filing. For his bankruptcy and in response to the DoD \nCAF\u2019s interrogatories, he provided budget worksheets. He calculated in his response to \nthe interrogatories that he had a monthly remainder of $812. In his Chapter 7 filing, his \nnet monthly income was calculated as negative $145. (Items 6 & 8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nI have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR \nfor disqualifying purposes. I may consider it in the application of mitigating conditions and \nin my whole-person analysis. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including numerous delinquent debts. \nMost of these debts continued without attempted resolution for several years. Applicant \nfiled Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in August 2022, after his ESI but prior to the SOR being issued. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 20 wholly apply. While Applicant\u2019s \nsuccessful Chapter 7 Bankruptcy case has resolved a significant amount of debt, his child \nsupport arrearages could not be discharged and will only increase. Though his children \nwill eventually age-out, that is at least five years away for the oldest child and does not \nextinguish the arrearages. This debt is large, growing, and not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. Applicant already had debts in collection in November 2014 and accrued \nadditional debt within the year prior to filing for bankruptcy. At least one of these more \nrecent debts was charged off. Though not alleged and, therefore, not disqualifying, it \ndemonstrates the behavior was recent, may recur, and casts doubt on his good \njudgement and reliability. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies in that the initial conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem appear to have largely been beyond Applicant\u2019s control (divorce, large child \nsupport payments, and unemployment). But AG \u00b6 20(b) is a two-part test and the second \npart requires the individual to have acted responsibly under the circumstances. The \nrecord does not demonstrate he did so. There is no evidence he had made any effort to \nrepay or otherwise resolve these debts prior to filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. He filed \napproximately two months after answering the DoD CAF\u2019s interrogatories regarding these \ndebts. Applicant admitted in his ESI he had forgotten about some of his debts. In addition, \nhe accrued new debt in the time-frame between Applicant\u2019s ESI and his answer to the \nCAF interrogatories which was also discharged in his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. A discharge \nin bankruptcy (particularly Chapter 7) resolves those debts but is not evidence of a track \nrecord of steady payments towards the debts, which would show good faith. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to question him about the specifics of his actions and whether he \nmade any additional effort to resolve his delinquent debts or evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.o, that Applicant had filed an unresolved Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy action, is mitigated as the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy is complete and his debts \nhave been discharged. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national.    \nApplicant admitted that he failed to mark that he had two children in Section 18 on \nhis October 2014 and August 2019 SCAs. He also admitted he answered \u201cno\u201d to the \nSection 26 questions regarding delinquencies involving routine accounts. I find \nApplicant\u2019s answer that he mistakenly failed to list his children in Section 18 of the SCA \ncredible. In light of all the circumstances, the evidence is insufficient to establish that the \nomission of his children was deliberate. Therefore, I find that no disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) applies to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant also admitted he marked \u201cno\u201d when he should have marked \u201cyes\u201d to \nSection 26 regarding delinquency involving routine accounts. While he states this was \nalso oversight, the amount of debt he was facing plus the specificity and detail of the \nquestions in Section 26 make this less likely. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) applies to the allegation in SOR \n\u00b6 2.b. \nWith regard to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b, I have also considered all of the \nmitigating conditions for personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17 and considered the following \nrelevant: (a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nApplicant volunteered to the Government investigator during his June 2020 ESI \nboth that he had two children he had failed to list and that he had delinquent debts he had \nfailed to disclose in his August 2018 SCA. In his answer to the SOR, he stated he \nmistakenly answered incorrectly and did not intend to falsify, deceive, or omit these facts. \nHe stated he would \u201cnot knowingly say I do not have kids when I do and have been paying \nchild support on them during the last two questionnaires. Regarding Section 26 he stated \nthat he knew the investigation would include a credit check so he had no reason to answer \n\u201dno\u201d and that he had just \u201cdefaulted.\u201d His ESI was his first opportunity to correct his \nomission. He volunteered the correct facts before being confronted with them.

See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion regarding the financial considerations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) but failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n::::, \nRobert B.

Applicant has a long history of \ncriminal conduct, going back over 40 years, to as recently as 2020. Most of the personal \nconduct security concerns relate to a variety of employment terminations between 2011 \nand 2019. Applicant also has accrued several delinquent debts, but financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated since the debts are largely resolved. The \nemployment-related personal conduct security concerns are either not established as \ndisqualifying conduct or are mitigated. However, Applicant\u2019s established history of \ncriminal conduct is too extensive, too long-term, and too recent to be considered \nmitigated under either the criminal conduct guideline, or, as cross-alleged, under the \npersonal conduct guideline. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 2, 2020, \nin connection with his employment.

The DSCA CAS issued the SOR under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an undated answer to the SOR, in which he answered all but \none of the allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On January 10, 2023, he completed \nhis SOR response by answering SOR \u00b6 3.a. The case was forwarded to the DOHA \nhearing office on March 1, 2023, and assigned to me on October 31, 2023. \nThe case was initially scheduled for hearing on December 13, 2023. On \nDecember 11, 2023, Applicant requested a continuance, essentially because he was \nnot prepared and wanted time to gather documentation. I granted his request, and the \nhearing was rescheduled to February 7, 2024, by mutual consent. \nThat hearing convened briefly but was continued when it became clear that \nApplicant had moved months before and had not received the Government\u2019s proposed \nexhibits in the mail. (Feb. 7, 2024 Tr. at 1-8) Once he confirmed that he had received \nthose documents, a new date was arranged. On February 13, 2024, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for February 27, 2024. \nApplicant\u2019s hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were all admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified but did not submit any documents. At the end of the hearing, I held \nthe record open to allow him the opportunity to do so. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted five documents regarding alleged debts \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E) and three other documents: a cover e-mail from \nApplicant; a screenshot of a text from his ex-girlfriend, B; and a letter from his current \ngirlfriend, P. (AE F through H). They were all admitted without objection. The record \nclosed on March 13, 2024. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 6, \n2024. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant admitted all of the Guideline J allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n) but for \nSOR \u00b6 1.l, which he denied. Under Guideline E, he admitted the cross-allegation of his \ncriminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.i. Under Guideline F, \nhe admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c and he denied SOR \u00b6 3.d. His admissions are incorporated \ninto the findings of fact.

He has a general equivalency degree (GED). He said \nhe needed a clearance to work at a federal building once but has never had access to \nclassified information. (GE 1; Tr. 10, 20-21, 64) \nApplicant began his most recent job in May 2020 and applied for a security \nclearance in October 2020. He works in a warehouse. (Tr. 19) On his SCA, he reported \na variety of other jobs in prior years, some of which led to terminations that are the \nsubject of most of the Guideline E allegations. They are discussed in turn, below. (GE 1) \nOn his SCA, Applicant reported certain criminal offenses, including an arrest for \nsecond degree trespass in February 2019, a domestic violence charge in September \n2019, and a January 2020 arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI). (GE 1 at 44-47) \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.n) These offenses, and other, earlier ones, are also discussed in \nturn, below. \nApplicant also disclosed on his SCA that he used cocaine about 12 times \nbetween about June 2014 and about August 2019. He said he had not used cocaine \nsince then and did not intend to use it again. (GE 1 at 47-48) (SOR \u00b6 2.b) In discussing \nhis financial record, he also disclosed a late-filed tax return and past-due debts to a \ndoctor and to a credit card company. (GE 1 at 50-53) \nApplicant had a background interview in June 2021. He discussed his \nemployment history, his arrest record, history of drug use, and his debts. In a \nSeptember 2022 interrogatory response, he authenticated the summary of his interview \nas accurate without making any edits. He said his finances were improving and that he \nhad had a chance to reflect on his past. (GE 2) \nGuideline J (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m, 2.a): \nIn July 1982, when he was about 16 years old, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with larceny. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Records indicate that he was found guilty and \nreceived probation. (GE 3) \nIn February 1983, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony larceny and \nbreaking and entering. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (GE 3) He was 17 years old at the time. He and \nsome friends broke into a factory and stole keys to the factory\u2019s vending machines to \nget the money inside. He was sentenced to eight months in jail. (GE 2 at 10) He \nacknowledged during his hearing that when he was young, he \u201chung out with the wrong \npeople\u201d and was \u201crunning with the wrong crowd.\u201d (Tr. 47) \nIn May 1996 (GE 4), Applicant was charged with assault on a female. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c) (GE 2 at 12; GE 4 at 3) He did not recall this charge during his interview or at his\nhearing.

(SOR \u00b6 1.d) The \ncharge was later dismissed. (GE 3, GE 4) He denied ever assaulting a female. In 2002, \nhe and his then girlfriend got into an argument. She hit him with a hammer, and he \nshoved her back, in self-defense, he said. They were both taken to jail for 48 hours. The \ncharges were later dropped. (GE 2 at 11-12; Tr. 50) \nAs a result of the same incident, Applicant was charged with simple possession \nof marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. (GE 4 at 5) The marijuana was the \nproperty of the woman he was involved with at the time. These drug charges were later \ndismissed after he took a drug education class. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 45) (The drug charges \nwere not alleged in the SOR). \nApplicant does have a history with illegal drugs, as he reported on his SCA. He \nbegan using cocaine in 2001. He used it sporadically until about four years ago, before \nhis current job. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) He said he had been in rehab twice, about 15 years ago, \nincluding 30 days of inpatient treatment. Before that, he has also attended Alcoholics \nAnonymous. He also used marijuana as a teenager. He has not used illegal drugs in \nseveral years, and he does not intend to do so in the future. (GE 1; Tr. 37-40, 53-56) \nIn February 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) He \nhad been drinking at a bar and was pulled over afterwards. His license was revoked for \nsix to twelve months, and the records indicate that he received 18 months of probation \nin October 2003, though he denied that at his hearing. (GE 2, GE 4; Tr. 44-45) \nIn December 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under a \nsuspended license, and in March 2008, he was arrested and charged with driving while \nhis license was revoked. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h) (GE 3; Tr. 43-44) \nIn December 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with unauthorized use of \na motor vehicle. (SOR \u00b6 1.i) (GE 3) He took the car of his then-girlfriend, R for the night, \nperhaps without permission, since she reported it stolen. The case was resolved \nthrough mediation. (GE 3, GE 4; GE 2 at 11; Tr. 43-44) \nIn August 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault on a female. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j) (GE 3, GE 4) He did not recall this charge during his interview. The charge \nwas later dismissed. (GE 2 at 12) He was with B, and he said \u201cshe got a kick out of \nsending me to jail.\u201d He denied assaulting her. (Tr. 42-43) \nIn October 2018, a domestic violence protective order was issued against \nApplicant. (SOR \u00b6 1.k) (GE 3 at 17-18) He explained that the complainant was his \nfianc\u00e9e, B. He denied hitting, punching, or taking any physical action against her. He \nbelieves she sought the protective order because she wanted to end their relationship. \nB had filed assault charges against him on several prior occasions.

He then \ngot into an argument with them over their spending. The boyfriend called police after \nasking Applicant to leave. The trespass charge was later dismissed. (GE 2 at 11; Tr. 41-\n42) \nIn September 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with violating a \ndomestic violence protective order. (SOR \u00b6 1.m) (GE 4) He had moved back in with B, \nbut she caught him texting another woman and a fight ensued. She called police and \nwhen they arrived, she told them he was in violation of the protective order (SOR\u00b6 1.k). \nThis was technically true, he acknowledged in his interview, even though she had asked \nhim to move back in with her. He was arrested for violating the protective order and \njailed for two weeks. As a result, he was terminated by his employer. (SOR \u00b6 2.i). B later \ndropped the charges. (GE 2 at 11) \nApplicant said he and B had a toxic relationship. They were together for 24 \nyears, until about 7 years ago. He stayed for the children to keep them in good hands. \nThe relationship was part of the reason for his drug use. He was not in a good place \nwith her, and he \u201cjust did things that I shouldn\u2019t have been doing.\u201d He said all of the \ndomestic violence charges involved B. He was charged but never convicted, and he \nbelieved that when he had a chance at a good job, she would ruin it for him. He has no \npending charges and is not on probation. He has had no subsequent issues or charges \nrelating to domestic violence or assault. (Tr. 35-36, 49-52) After the hearing, he \nprovided a text message from B, discussed below. (AE H) \nIn January 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI. (SOR \u00b6 1.n) (GE \n4) Records reflect that he received a 120-day suspended jail term and two years of \nprobation. (GE 2 at 8, GE 4) He had several shots of vodka at home after work. He was \nasked unexpectedly to go to the home of a family friend, about 10 miles away, to help \nthe friend with a household task. He was pulled over for speeding on the way there, and \nhe was arrested for DWI after failing roadside sobriety tests. (GE 2 at 8)  \nIn December 2020, Applicant pled guilty to DWI. His license was suspended for \n12 months other than for work. He had to take an alcohol awareness class and perform \ncommunity service, which he did. He has had no subsequent alcohol-related or other \noffenses. He has an active driver\u2019s license with no restrictions. (GE 4; Tr. 40-41, 54, 57) \nWhen asked what has changed since then, Applicant said he is working to do \nbetter. He is no longer in a volatile relationship, so that has helped with his anger \nissues. He has not been through formal counseling.

He \nexplained and testified that he had a personality conflict or miscommunication with a \nsupervisor, a conflict that he said was largely due to a language barrier. He thought the \nsupervisor sent him to the wrong place. He does not believe he did anything wrong. (GE \n4 at 6; Tr. 29-30) \nJune 2015 -- termination from company 2. No reason is alleged.

(GE 2 at 5) He said the son \nwas \u201ca really bad drug addict.\u201d Applicant confronted the owner or a supervisor about it \nand \u201cthat was the end of me.\u201d (Tr. 30) \nJune 2015 -- termination from company 3.

(GE \n4 at 6) He said he was there only briefly and said the job did not offer enough pay. (Tr. \n30-31) \nIn December 2017, Applicant resigned in lieu of being terminated by company 4 \nfor misconduct, including, allegedly, inappropriate sexual behavior. (SOR \u00b6 2.f) He \nexplained in his background interview and his testimony that he and other employees \nwere on a six-month assignment away from home (during the week) and often went to \nthe hotel restaurant for meals. On one occasion, he ordered a beer from a younger \nwaitress, who then was seen socializing with co-workers instead of providing him \nprompt service. This led him to yell at her that she should \u201cdo her job.\u201d She brought the \nbeer but slammed it on the table. He finished his meal and left. Afterwards, co-workers \nwho were present urged the waitress to file a complaint against him to his company. \nWhen she did, he was fired. He was called in to work, but, knowing he would be fired, \nhe chose not to appear. About two weeks later, when he went in to collect his final \npaycheck, he was told he was a \u201cno call, no show,\u201d so he was not eligible for \nunemployment compensation.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts of about $9,000 are established by the record \nevidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant incurred some delinquent debts during periods of unemployment and \nunder employment. Those debts totaled about $9,000.

The most recent credit report in the record, from \nDecember 2023, shows no new debts of significance. His debts are largely tied to his \nemployment situation, which has not always been stable. He documented good-faith \nresolution and payment of several of the debts. He has established that his financial \nissues are unlikely to recur and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. The above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has a long history of criminal offenses, going back to his teenage \nyears, up to 2020. As an adult, he has several charges and arrests for assault on a \nfemale, albeit charges that were dismissed, other domestic-related charges \n(trespassing), violations of domestic violence protection orders, as well as two DWIs, \nand other driving charges. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and  \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has the burden to establish that his criminal conduct is mitigated and \nwill not be repeated. He has a long history of criminal conduct, going back over 40 \nyears, up to as recently as 2020. He has several charges of domestic-related violence, \nand of violating domestic-violence protective orders. He has two DWIs, one as recent as \n2020. His established history of criminal conduct is too extensive, too long-term, and too \nrecent to be considered mitigated under the criminal conduct guideline. He did not \nestablish that his criminal conduct is unlikely to recur or that it does not cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply to \nmitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, \nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations.  \nThe personal conduct allegations in this case are best addressed in three parts. \nFirst, there is SOR \u00b6 2.a, which is a cross-allegation under the personal conduct \nguideline of the criminal conduct allegations addressed above under Guideline J. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecond, there is SOR \u00b6 2.b, which concerns Applicant\u2019s cocaine use from about 2001 \nto 2019. And third, there is the matter of Applicant\u2019s various employment terminations. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.i) \nThe cross-alleged criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a) has already been determined to \nbe disqualifying under Guideline J. Thus, AG \u00b6 16(c) does not technically apply. \nHowever, that conduct can still be considered under the general personal conduct \nsecurity concern, as conduct involving questionable judgment or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. . . .\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nApplicant\u2019s cocaine use (SOR \u00b6 2.b) was not alleged under either the criminal \nconduct or drug involvement guidelines, and it is itself rather sporadic and dated. \nNevertheless, it may still be considered under Guideline E as further evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s poor judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) therefore apply to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nThis leaves Applicant\u2019s various employment terminations, between 2011 and \n2019. As an initial matter, the security significance of an employment termination is \noften difficult to adjudicate because there are frequently multiple sides to the story, and \nonly one side is presented in this forum. Many employments are \u201cat will\u201d and end for any \nnumber of reasons, not always related to misconduct or poor performance of the \nemployee (the applicant). As here, the record is often without documentation from the \nemployer about what actually happened. \nIt is difficult to attach security significance to most of the employment \nterminations alleged here. First, none of the terminations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e, \nare alleged to have occurred due to Applicant\u2019s misconduct or poor performance. Nor \nare those characteristics established by the record evidence, since they appear to relate \nto disagreements with supervisors or to reasonable miscommunications. SOR \u00b6 1.g \nresulted from a disagreement with subordinates. SOR \u00b6 1.h resulted after Applicant \nfailed to call in sick, as he should have, after going to the doctor. I do not regard any of \nthese terminations as establishing a personal conduct security concern. No Guideline E \ndisqualifying conditions apply to those allegations. \nThis leaves SOR \u00b6 2.f, when Applicant was terminated from the job (or quit) after \nhe yelled at a young waitress at the hotel restaurant. He denied saying anything \ninappropriate and the record does not support that he engaged in \u201cinappropriate sexual \nbehavior\u201d as alleged, or that he otherwise harassed her. He does appear to have acted \nrudely and inappropriately towards her at best, which is likely why he was terminated. \nThere is also SOR \u00b6 2.i, when Applicant was terminated for not showing up to \nwork in September 2019. This occurred because he was incarcerated after violating the \ndomestic violence protection order (SOR \u00b6 1.m). \nThese two terminations constitute instances of poor judgment, if not poor \nperformance or misconduct. Thus, AG \u00b6 16(d)(2) and (3) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.i. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe other employment terminations do not suggest a personal conduct security \nconcern. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E. \nAmong them is the following: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nThe two employment terminations remaining to be mitigated both occurred \nseveral years ago (2017 and 2019). Applicant has been employed in his current job \nsince 2020, without incident. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies to mitigate SOR \u00b6 2.f and 2.i. \nHowever, SOR \u00b6 2.a and 2.b are not mitigated. Applicant\u2019s numerous instances \nof criminal conduct are not mitigated under Guideline J, and for the same reasons, the \nrelated cross-allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a) is not mitigated under Guideline E. Applicant\u2019s \ncocaine use constitutes additional criminal conduct, even though it was not alleged that \nway in the SOR. Although he has not used cocaine in several years, his drug use and \nhis long record of criminal conduct are all examples of poor judgment and failure to \ncomply with rules and regulations that goes to the heart of the protection of classified \ninformation. Established personal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant has a long history of criminal conduct, going back to his teenage years, \nto as recently as 2020. While other personal conduct and financial allegations are \nmitigated, his established history and pattern of criminal conduct is too extensive, too \nlong-term, and too recent to be considered mitigated under either the criminal conduct \nguideline, or, as cross-alleged, under the personal conduct guideline. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

It is \nalso alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy; and was terminated from his \nemployment with a defense contractor for misuse of company funds. Applicant denies \neach of the allegations with explanations. \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated \nSeptember 25, 2018; January 29, 2021; February 4, 2021; November 23, 2021; March \n3, 2022; October 11, 2022; and October 16, 2023, confirms this indebtedness. \n(Government Exhibits 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.) Applicant was hired by defense \ncontractor A, his current employer in November 2020. \nApplicant has been investing in real estate for the past twenty years. He and his \nex-wife, who are still good friends, have partnered on the purchase of multiple \nproperties in the past. Applicant presently owns several properties with her. It is \nimportant for him to maintain a good credit rating in order to obtain good loan interest \nrates. \nIn 2014, in an effort to improve his credit rating, Applicant partnered with a \nwoman he thought was operating a credit repair company. Applicant stated that from \n2014 to 2018, he was involved in what he found to be a \u201cponzi scheme\u201d that instead of \nimproving his credit, ultimately ruined his credit. He explained that in 2014, he met a \nwoman at a sporting event who ran a wealth management company that did credit \nrepair for their clients. She and Applicant became good friends and about six months \nlater, Applicant became her business partner in her firm. Applicant listened to her \nmarketing pitches, met some of her associates, and believed that she was authentic. \nShe and Applicant agreed that his role was to be the face of the company, and she \nwould operate the business. At the time, Applicant had a 712 credit rating and hoped to \nbring it up to 800 in order to obtain better real estate loans and other financial \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopportunities. Applicant trusted his partner. Applicant registered with the State as the \nCEO, the CFO, and the Secretary of their company. Applicant also provided her with all \nof his personal information, including his address and social security number. She used \nApplicant\u2019s credit to open up fictitious accounts under his name. The agreement they \nhad was that once the business got off the ground, she would pay the Applicant a \ncertain number of dividends each month. Applicant claims that he never received any \nprofit from the business, however he does admit that she paid off one of his delinquent \naccounts. Somehow, with the credit she opened in his name, she gave him money to \npay his bills from time to time. She claimed that she was building Applicant\u2019s credit line \nwith the accounts that she opened. \nShe was supposed to pay a windfall to the \nApplicant at some point. But, he never received it. At some point, during their partner \nrelationship Applicant realized that the business was a scam or \u201cponzi scheme\u201d. He \nadmits that towards the end of their partnership, his business partner started paying off \nsome of his debt, but the damage had already been done. (Tr. p. 105.) In June 2021, \nApplicant filed a police report and turned in his partner for scamming him. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit C.) Applicant stated that the police told him that they located his partner, and \nthat they were prosecuting her. \nApplicant stated that in total, she ran up about \n$130,000 worth of debt in his name. (Tr. p. 65.) He believes that his partner is in jail \nand he was left with the debt. (Tr. p. 68.) \nApplicant stated that he never received any bills from any of the creditors for \naccounts that she opened in his name. He acknowledges that in 2018, he saw a \ndocument that showed that he had delinquent debt, but he thought it was debt he had \nprevious to meeting her. (Tr. pp. 63 \u2013 68.) \nApplicant worked for defense contractor B from 1984 to 2016. (Tr. p. 49.) while \nat work, Applicant heard one of the subcontractors discussing that he could get a \ndiscount on the purchase of certain appliances. It just so happened that Applicant was \nlooking to purchase a washer, dryer, and refrigerator, for his daughter who was moving \nout. Applicant took advantage of the offer and ordered the appliances. They were \nsubsequently delivered to Applicant\u2019s home, but never paid for. Applicant stated that it \nwas about this time that he was sick and missed work for several days.  He had planned \nto pay for the appliances when he got back to work. When Applicant returned to work, \nhis supervisor confronted him about the situation that a purchase for appliances had \nbeen billed to the company. Applicant told him that he did not know how that happened, \nbut that he was going to straighten it out. Applicant stated that he went to the bank to \nget the money to satisfy the debt, but it was too late. In June 2016, Applicant was \nterminated from his employment for misuse of company funds. (Government Exhibit 4, \nand Tr. 135 - 137.) In 2016, the defense contractor obtained a judgment against the \nApplicant for this misconduct in the amount of $8,280. (Tr. p. 140.) \nFollowing his employment termination, Applicant was unemployed from 2016 to \n2018. While unemployed, and still associating with his business partner in the ponzi \nscheme, he purchased a Porshe in August 2016. In March 2017, he leased a new \nEscalade and traded in his 2014 Escalade. He traveled with his business partner to Fiji \nin October 2017; Jamaica in April 2017; and Aruba in April 2018. \n(Tr. p. 74-75.) \nApplicant stated that by this time, he knew that his partner had opened up accounts in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n        \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhis name, he knew that the accounts were delinquent, and that he had not received any \nmoney from her.

(Tr. p. 75.) \nApplicant testified that before he started working with her, he already had about $80,000 \nin debt. \nApplicant stated that he consulted an attorney to determine what would be in his \nbest interest on how to address his excessive delinquent indebtedness. Applicant was \nadvised to file for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy which he filed in April 2020. At some later \ndate he spoke to another attorney in the firm who advised him to stop the Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy, since he would have to pay back the money. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nApplicant stated that he sold his home and used $60,000 in profits to negotiate \nsettlements on some of his outstanding debts. \nApplicant currently earns about \n$180,000 annually. \nHe also receives a pension from defense contractor B in the \namount of $1,500 monthly. (Tr. p. 47.) \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in about April 2020. \nThe \nBankruptcy was dismissed as described above.  (Government Exhibit 13.) \n1.b. Applicant is indebted to CREDITOR A for an account that was charged off in \nthe amount of $18,244. Applicant claims that he had two accounts with PEN FED and \nthat this account is not the one he opened. He claims that this account was opened in \nhis name to improve his credit by his business partner as part of the business scheme. \nHowever, during Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview in 2021, he told the investigator \nthat he opened these accounts and that he used the money to pay for living expenses. \n(Government Exhibit 3, 5 through 11, and Tr. p. 80.) The debt remains owing. \n Applicant is indebted to CREDITOR B for an account that was charged off in \nthe amount of $7,602. \nApplicant claims that the account was opened in his name to \nimprove his credit by his business partner as part of the business scheme. \n(Government Exhibits 5 through 11, and Tr. p. 82.) The debt remains owing. \n1.d. Applicant is indebted to CREDITOR B for another account that was placed \nfor collection in the amount of $4,913.

The debt remains owing. \n1.h. \nIn March 2016, Applicant ordered appliances for personal use from a \nsubcontractor for defense contactor B. \nThe appliances were billed to defense \ncontractor B when Applicant failed to pay for them. \nApplicant was subsequently \nterminated from his employment for misuse of company funds. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \nApplicant incurred excessive delinquent debt that he has not paid. \nHis actions \nor inactions both demonstrate a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do \nso. The evidence is sufficient to raise th above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant contends that the debts listed in the SOR are not his responsibility \nsince he did not open them but were opened in his name as part of a business scheme \ncausing them to be delinquently indebted. A close analysis of this situation reveals that \nApplicant gave his partner permission to open the accounts. He hired her to help him \nimprove his credit rating. He provided her with his personal information, he knew what \nshe was doing, and he even partnered with her in this business venture. Applicant \ncannot now say that they are not his debts. He knew or should have known that if it \nsounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true. Applicant\u2019s partner was a fraud, \nand so was he. As a business partner, he allowed her to use his credit to create this \n\u201cponzi scheme\u201d. Soon after meeting her and joining her company, Applicant realized \nthat his debts were not being paid on time and that they were increasing, but he did \nnothing. Instead of getting out of the business, he continued to do business with her \nand even traveled with her internationally. As he described it, \u201cit was like a bribery, or \nthe carrot that she had hanging over my head,\u201d and he bit it. (Tr. pp. 74 - 75.) During \ntheir four-year business partnership, Applicant allowed her to use his name to open up \nfictitious accounts, knowing that his bills were not being paid and his credit was being \nruined. He failed to show maturity, good judgment, or trustworthiness. He remains \nindebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR. \n (g) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFurthermore, Applicant ordered appliances from a subcontractor of his employer \nin order to get a discount. He did not pay for the appliances and the bill went to his \nemployer. This is against company policy, rules, and regulations, and Applicant knew \nor should have known better than this. As a result of this misconduct, Applicant lost his \njob and his marriage. \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of financial irresponsibility casts serious \ndoubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant has made a \nnumber of poor financial decisions that have negatively impacted his life. He needs \nmore time to show the Government that he can reset and work hard to resolve his \nfinancial delinquencies with regular systematic payments and consistency and avoid \nincurring any further unnecessary indebtedness. None of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. Applicant has not resolved his debts. He still owes a \nsignificant amount of money to his creditors and has not made it a priority to resolve \nthem. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried \nhis burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nclassified information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or classified information or technology and the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a foreign country \nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his \nor her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship \nwith even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd.

The country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018). \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s connections to Pakistan and the allegations contained \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, all of the above security concerns are established. Pakistan \nhas documented challenges with terrorism, human rights abuses and governmental \naccountability. Applicant maintains frequent contact with her parents and two sisters \nwho are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Although Applicant has petitioned and \nreceived initial approval for her parents to move to the United States, they remain in \nPakistan pending visa interviews. Applicant expressed hope that they would move in \n2024 but could not provide any specific date as the process is outside of her control. \nTherefore, the above security concerns are not negated by her parents\u2019 undetermined \nmove to the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with her uncle in Pakistan is significantly less frequent. \nNonetheless, his former government association increases the heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. The above \nsecurity concerns are also established for SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s statements reflected in SOR \u00b61.e, the summary of the \nbackground interview lacks clarity about Applicant\u2019s loyalty toward Pakistan and the \nUnited States. In subsequent statements, Applicant repeatedly asserted that she held \nloyalty to the United States as well as her family. I find that her statement about refusing \nto participate in anything that would negatively impact Pakistan to be reflective of the \nloyalty she had toward her family and not that of the country of Pakistan. Security \nconcerns solely rising from this statement have not been established. However, the \nstatement further supports that Applicant understandably maintains strong bonds of \naffection with family members in Pakistan. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter the Government produces substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifts to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns under Guideline B, \nincluding the following which are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; and  \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant maintains frequent contact with her parents and two sisters who reside \nin Pakistan. It cannot be said that her relationship with these family members are casual \nor infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2009. Her husband is a U.S. citizen \nand they have two young children. They own their home and their investments are in \nthe United States. They do not own any property or investments in Pakistan. Applicant \nalso has one sister who is a citizen and resident of the United States. These are all \nfactors that weigh in Applicant's favor. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s ties to Pakistan are also strong. She maintains a very close \nrelationship with her parents and siblings in Pakistan, communicating with them \nfrequently. She has provided financial support when needed. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that she will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the Unites States. Additionally, \nApplicant did not meet her burden of demonstrating that she would resolve any conflict \nof interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.c. \nHowever, Applicant does not have an ongoing relationship with her uncle.

Her ties to her uncle are infrequent, and all of the above \nmitigating conditions are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the security concern regarding foreign preference: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(d) Participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(2) Otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts with \nU.S. national security interests.  \nApplicant stated during her background interview that she would not participate in \nanything that negatively impacted Pakistan. If established, her refusal to serve the \ninterests of the United States over another country raises potential concerns of foreign \npreference. However, in the background interview and subsequently, Applicant \nrepeatedly sought to clarify that her loyalty rested with her family and the United States. \nAs discussed above, I find that Applicant\u2019s statements reflect her strong bonds of \naffection toward her parents and sisters, rather than the country of Pakistan and do not \nestablish a foreign preference security concern. AG \u00b6 9 and the specific security \nconcerns listed in AG \u00b6 10(d)(2) are not applicable and SOR \u00b6 2.a has not been \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B and Guideline C in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2009. Her husband is a U.S. citizen \nand they have two young children who are U.S. citizens. She is committed to raising her \nfamily in the United States. Numerous character references testified about her strong \ncommitment to her family, work and community. \nApplicant also has a close relationship with her parents and two sisters in \nPakistan. She traveled to Pakistan to care for her mother during cancer treatment in \n2020 and has provided financial support when needed. She is also in the process of \nhaving her parents move to the United States, but was unable to state when that would \noccur. Her connections to and support for her family in Pakistan exemplify strong \ncharacter traits of loyalty to family. \nWhile there is nothing unusual about her relationship with family members in \nPakistan, her present circumstances are such that she could be placed in an untenable \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a loved one and the United States. \n\u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely \nan acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices \nthat could be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). Based on the facts and circumstances before \nme, concerns of undue foreign influence persist. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did \nnot mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 9, 2020, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIPs) to obtain security clearance eligibility required for his \nposition with a defense contractor. On August 26, 2020, Applicant provided a personal \nsubject interview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated \nAdjudications Services (CAS) could not render affirmative findings required to grant a \nsecurity clearance, and issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 24, 2023, detailing security concerns raised by the guidelines for psychological \nconditions (Guideline I), drug involvement (Guideline H), and personal conduct \n(Guideline E). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG), effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn January 22, 2023, Applicant provided an answer to the SOR. He denied \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, contending that there was no actual suicide attempt, but rather thoughts \nconcerning the attempt. He denied his hospitalization in October 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) was \ninvoluntary. He denied the statement by the Government psychologist (SOR \u00b6 1.h) that \nhis current support structure may also constitute a risk factor in the future for \nmaladaptive behavior. He admitted the remaining allegations of SOR \u00b6 1. He admitted \nboth drug involvement allegations under \u00b6 2. In his responses to the four personal \nconduct allegations under SOR \u00b6 3, he declared that although his omissions were \nunintentional, he wanted a chance to explain. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on December 8, 2023, for a hearing on February 13, 2024. The hearing was \nheld via Teams teleconference services as scheduled. The Government\u2019s eight exhibits, \n(GE) 1 through 8, were entered into evidence without objection. (Tr. 18) A stipulation \nwas entered between the parties agreeing that Applicant has had a security clearance \nsince September 30, 2010. As a result, GE 9 was not admitted into the record. \nApplicant\u2019s 15 exhibits, AE A through O, were admitted into evidence without objection. \n(Tr. 19) On February 29, 2024, Department Counsel indicated no objection to \nApplicant\u2019s five post-hearing character statements (AE P),and they were entered into \nevidence. I have taken administrative notice of excerpts from the fifth edition of the \nDiagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), specifically adjustment disorders, \nmajor depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, borderline personality \ndisorders, bipolar and related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 29, 2024, and the \nrecord closed the same day. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 39 years old.

This employment is not listed in his July 2020 security clearance application, \nthough he testified that he worked for several contractors after his military discharge in \n2014. Since 2019, he has been working as a data center manager for a contractor that \ndoes work for the United States Coast Guard. (GE 1 at 13-14; Tr. 22, 60-63, 95) \nThe SOR lists eight allegations under Guideline I. They are: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 In about 1999, Applicant tried to commit suicide by placing a belt \naround his neck and jumping from a balcony, but the belt broke. Government \ndocumentation in three locations cite this incident. (GE 5 at 1; GE 6 at 28, 127) \nApplicant denied the allegation and explained that it amounted to a suicidal ideation and \nnot a suicide attempt. He also claimed there was no evidence, i.e., ligature marks on his \nneck, to support the allegation. In February 2024, Applicant\u2019s mother indicated by \ncharacter reference that Applicant never tried to commit suicide at age 14 or at any \nother time during his youth. (Tr. 24, 98-100; AE P at 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 There were several events occurring ahead of Applicant\u2019s \nNovember 2012 inpatient treatment that he believed explained the reason for his \nhospitalization. During his boot camp in April 2010, Applicant\u2019s fellow service member, \nwho he became friendly with because of the similarity in their backgrounds, committed \nsuicide. The event had a profoundly emotional effect on him. (Tr. 25-27) During his \ndeployment overseas from September 2011 to August 2012, he volunteered for the \nmortuary service-section of his unit. In April 2012, Applicant lost a second fellow service \nmember friend to suicide. This incident was unforgettable because Applicant had to \nprepare and stand guard over the body of the service member friend until it was shipped \nto the United States. A contractor friend recognized Applicant\u2019s sadness over his \nfriend\u2019s death, and they consumed a few beers to help Applicant cope with the loss. \nThis was the first time that Applicant consumed alcohol. The alcohol also helped him \nsleep. (Tr. 29-33) \nApplicant returned from deployment in August 2012. His fellow sailors viewed \nhis overseas assignment as a vacation, despite the evaluation reports showing the bona \nfide nature of those assignments during his deployment. In addition, he received a \nmessage from a nationwide relief organization that his grandfather had cancer. \nUnidentified members of the command thought the message was a fabricated \nopportunity by Applicant to evade duty, and he became upset. Either the leading petty \nofficer (LPO) or the second in command (XO) recommended that he seek medical \nattention. He reported that he took the pills and spent five days in inpatient treatment in \nNovember 2012. His treatment at the military hospital did not go well, as Applicant \nsensed that the focus of his treatment was directed at returning him to his unit rather \ntreating his mental condition. The medical records show that he was involuntarily \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nadmitted for inpatient treatment with more than three months of depressive symptoms \nintensified by the loss of friends in his life. His diagnosis was a mixed personality \ndisorder (SOR \u00b6 1.b; GE 7 at 36-42; Tr. 33-41) \nDuring aftercare, he ran out of the medications that he was prescribed. To ease \nhis fluctuating anxiety, he began smoking marijuana in early November 2013 with his \nfirst spouse. Two weeks later, he reported for another command assignment. On \nNovember 15, 2013, he took a urinalysis, which was customary protocol for sailors \nreporting to a new command. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 43) Applicant\u2019s anxiety increased because \nhe had not been informed about his job assignments at his new command. On \nDecember 13, 2013, he was informed that he failed the November 2013 urine test. Even \nthough he was taken to Captain\u2019s Mast, he avoided more serious punishment when the \ncommand released him with a warning after he asserted that he had only used \nmarijuana once, and would not use the drug again. (GE 2 at 4-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 At a later date in December 2013, Applicant was reassigned to \nanother command and took a second urinalysis test within 20 days of having taken the \nfirst one in November 2013. He failed the second test. He explained to the command \nthat the marijuana that he used in November 2013 was still in his system. The \ncommand did not believe him, and he was found guilty of Article 112 (illegal drug use) of \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). (GE 2 at 4) \nAlso, after Applicant arrived at his new facility in late December 2013, his \ncommand noticed his erratic behavior and advised him to seek inpatient treatment at a \nmilitary hospital for suicidal ideations. His discharge diagnosis after inpatient treatment \nwas adjustment disorder with depressed mood. (GE 5 at 2-4, 21; Tr. 43-48) \nDuring his December 2013 treatment, Applicant believed that the medical \nofficials were receptive to the information he provided about his condition. However, \nduring a discussion with a prescriber about treatment, the prescriber took a phone call \nthat Applicant interpreted as disrespectful interruption of their discussion, and \ndemonstrated to him that she was not serious about his mental state. Upon leaving the \nprescriber\u2019s office, Applicant attempted suicide by cutting his wrists with a belt buckle. \nThe prescriber apologized but explained the phone call was from Applicant\u2019s command \ninquiring when he was going to be released back to the command. The chronology of \nevents reinforced Applicant\u2019s opinion that his command\u2019s goal was to return the service \nmember to his unit rather than treating the member until his mental issues were \ncompletely resolved. (Tr. 48-52) \nIn January 2014, Applicant was administratively separated from the Navy with a \ndischarge under other than Honorable Conditions. On July 30, 2019, the discharge was \nupgraded to a General Discharge under Honorable. Conditions. (AE G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 In December 2014, Applicant received inpatient treatment at a \nVeteran\u2019s Affairs (VA) medical center for suicidal ideations.

(GE \n6 at 97) During treatment, he cut his wrist with a belt buckle. His discharge diagnosis \nwas major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cannabis use \ndisorder and borderline personality traits. (GE 6 at 1) The remainder of the exhibit \nconfirm various contacts he had with psychologists, nurses, and case managers during \ntreatment and aftercare. (GE 6 at 8-167) \nApplicant received inpatient treatment at a VA facility in December 2014 (SOR \n\u00b6 1d) because he felt guilty in not appreciating his wife\u2019s overtures of support earlier in \nthe year of 2014. Before his admission for the December 2014 hospitalization, lack of \naccess to the VA made him feel like he was not veteran. He believed that he had failed \nhis country and himself because he always wanted to be a career sailor. After making \nseveral calls to treatment clinics, he entered his car and was driving on a road trying to \ndecide a location where he would end his life. Fortunately, an attendant from an \noutpatient clinic that he had called earlier, escorted him to the VA medical center. (Tr. \n55-58) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant\u2019s inpatient treatment in January 2021 was for suicidal \nideations. SOR \u00b6 1.f: His inpatient treatment in June 2021 was for anxiety and \ndepression. SOR \u00b6 1.g: His inpatient treatment in October 2021 resulted from cutting his \nwrists. \nApplicant believed the three VA hospitalizations were related to his third friend\u2019s \nsuicide in June 2020. This is the same individual who consoled Applicant over beers in \nApril 2014 after his second friend committed suicide (Tr. 31), and who helped Applicant \nobtain federal employment in May 2015 (Tr. 60). His treatment at the VA in January \n2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was not successful because of his dissatisfaction with the VA medical \ncare and medications. The onset of his depression was partially due to apparent VA \nadministrative mismanagement in accommodating his request for assignment to a new \nmental health care team. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 63, 71) \nIn June 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), Applicant received inpatient treatment for anxiety and \ndepression due to losing several family members to the COVID-pandemic. (GE 3 at 2; \nGE 8 at 68; Tr. 77) \nIn October 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), Applicant was hospitalized for cutting his wrists. \nHe remembered he drove to a bridge and began cutting his arm with some kind of \nweapon. An officer approached him and asked him to drop the weapon or the officer \nwould discharge his firearm. When the officer asked him whether he wanted help, \nApplicant replied that he did. The officer put him in an ambulance handcuffed and took \nhim to a VA medical facility. He remained in inpatient for 72 hours. Applicant quibbled \nwith whether his hospitalization was involuntary because he has always voluntarily \nsought treatment. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 78-82) The officer probably put Applicant in handcuffs \nfor his own protection. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant does not believe the episodes will recur in the future because he has \nbeen in therapy treatment for the for more than two years with a family nurse \npractitioner (FNP). Applicant also provided testimony about the regular therapy and \ncounseling he has received since his last hospitalization in 2021. He faithfully maintains \nhis therapy and treatment because he wants to provide stability and security for his \ndaughter. He has consistently complied with his medication regimen. He has regular \ninteraction with his spiritual counsel. He belongs to a veterans skateboard organization \nthat helps veterans cope with stress. He stopped using marijuana and alcohol in June \n2023. (GE 3 at 2, 5;Tr. 82-89, 145-149) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h \u2013 In May 2022, a licensed psychologist (Dr. L) was hired by DCSA \nCAS (formerly DOD CAF) to conduct an evaluation and issue a report, including a \nprognosis, on whether Applicant has a mental condition that could impair his judgment \nreliability, or trustworthiness. Dr. L reviewed mental health records in GE 5, 6, 7, an 8, \nalong with Applicant\u2019s most July 2020, e-QIP. I was unable to identify the investigatory \nactivity Dr. L reviewed on March 29, 2021. Dr. L conducted a clinical interview through \ndirect observation of Applicant and administration of the Personality Assessment \nInventory (PAI). \nDr. L evaluated Applicant on May 23, 2022, and rendered a report on June 2, \n2022. (GE 3) The psychological results of the PAI suggested Applicant\u2019s unhappiness \nand mood issues, and his need for psychological and psychiatric assistance. His clinical \nprofile suggested strained working relationships, notwithstanding his positive picture of \nhis current working relationships. The PAI test results suggested no alcohol or drug \nabuse or dependence. The FNP advised Dr. L that she has been consulting with \nApplicant since July 2021. She noted that his past marital discord contributed to his past \ndepressive episodes, but reported that the marital relationship had improved \ndramatically. She informed Dr. L that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is stable and she does not \nbelieve his condition will deteriorate as long he continues taking his medication. (GE 3 \nat 4-5) \nBased on her overall evaluation, Dr. L described Applicant as a polite person, \n\u201cand appeared to be honest and sincere regarding his significant depression, anxiety, \nsuicidal, substance abuse, and non-suicidal self-injury history\u2026His mood and \nsymptoms may fluctuate with the current state of his relationships, and he is not likely to \nbecome immune from thoughts of suicide in the future.\u201d Dr. L concluded that the long-\nterm effectiveness of Applicant\u2019s medication is ambiguous because only seven months \nhave passed since his last suicide attempt. Because his judgment has been poor in the \npast, his current judgment was deemed to be only fair. According to the DSM-5, his \nbipolar and personality disorder expose him to suicide more than 15 times that of the \ngeneral population. Applicant\u2019s positive support system contributes to a positive \nprognosis but, because of his maladaptive personality and pattern of unstable \nrelationships, the positive support system can become a risk factor for maladaptive \nbehavior in the future.

At Dr, \nM\u2019s direction, at least nine psychological tests were conducted on Applicant. (AE D at 1-\n2) Dr. M reviewed medical and counseling records dated from October 2010 to \nNovember 2020. She conducted a clinical interview of Applicant. (AE D at 1-2) There is \nno indication that Dr. M reviewed medical records from the VA for Applicant\u2019s three \ninpatient treatments in 2021. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g) Dr. M\u2019s reference to Applicant\u2019s \n6 hospitalizations in 2021 is incorrect as he was not hospitalized six times in 2021, but \nsix times since 2013. The next portion of the paragraph is accurate about Applicant \nconsulting a therapist every two weeks since 2021. However, there is no indication or \nimplication that Dr. M actually reviewed medical records for 2021. (AE D at 11) \nOn one psychological test, Applicant\u2019s symptoms of depression and stress \nwere in the mild range, while his anxiety was in the severe range. His results on the PAI \ndid not suggest efforts to distort the results, indicating that he answered the questions \nhonestly. (AE D at 3) The results in Applicant\u2019s Minnesota Multiphasic Inventory (MMPI-\n2) displayed clinically significant anxiety. (AE D at 9-10) \nDuring the course of Dr. M\u2019\u2019s evaluation of Applicant, he informed her that he \nhad discussed a safety action plan for emergency situations with his therapist. Dr. M \nrequested a copy of the plan or a facsimile of the plan. Applicant indicated that he was \nworking on the plan. However, Dr. M did not receive it. (AE D at 11) \nDr. M concluded that there was insufficient information to support a bipolar \ndiagnosis in April 2022. She observed that Applicant\u2019s previous diagnosis of anxiety \ndisorder should be labelled PTSD, together with a diagnosis of major depressive \ndisorder, current episode, severe. Dr. M recommended continued increased therapy \nsessions and regular contact with his psychiatrist. Dr. M also recommended periodic \nrelaxation to relieve stress. Maintaining a healthy diet and regular physical activity was \nalso important. (AE D at 13-18) \nIn December 2023, Applicant consulted with the FNP for his regular psychiatric \nevaluation and counseling for PTSD and depression. In January 2024, the FNP \nindicated in her progress note that Applicant had a history of hospitalizations for \ndepression disorder and PTSD, but had not been hospitalized for at least the last two \nyears. His mood has improved since completing the drug and alcohol courses in \nSeptember 2023. ( AE I, J) \nThe SOR lists two allegations under Guideline H. They are: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, 2.b \u2013 Applicant initially used marijuana in November 2013 when he \nsmoked the illegal drug with his first wife. His reason for using the drug was the lack of \nmedication when he was transferred to his new command.

His \ncommand imposed no NJC punishment when Applicant promised that he would not use \nmarijuana in the future. He claimed that he did not use marijuana again until 2019, and \ndeclared to the OPM investigator in August 2020 that in February 2020, he stopped \nusing marijuana and had no intentions for future use. (GE 2 at 5) Those claims were \nfalse as he resumed use of the drug some time in 2014 and continued using it until June \n2023. (Tr. 66, 124). Applicant considered his use of marijuana was motivated by \nmedical rather than recreational reasons. He used the drug because of its positive effect \non his stomach and sleep issues. Initially, friends would give him the drug, then he \nbegan purchasing the drug. (Tr. 65-67) He obtained a medical marijuana card in 2021 to \nmedicate his PTSD. (Tr. 126) In September 2023, Applicant completed a substance \nabuse program. (AE E) In December 2023, he was administered a hair follicle test. The \nresults were negative for marijuana and four other drugs. (AE F) \nThe SOR lists four allegations under Guideline E. They are: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.d \u2013On July 9, 2020, Applicant signed and certified an e-\nQIP. Under Section 23 of the form requiring information about illegal drug activity, illegal \ndrug activity while possessing a security clearance, and psychological events set forth \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d SOR \u00b6 3.d is withdrawn because it \nduplicates the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nIn his January 2023 answer to the e-QIP, Applicant indicated the omissions \nwere unintentional because he wanted a chance to explain. If his negative response to \nthe questions was unintentional, then he would have logically nothing to explain unless \nhe was concealing some information. In his August 2020 PSI, he explained that he \nomitted information about his illegal marijuana use because he did not want to be \u201cpre-\njudged\u201d and wanted to explain that he did not want to lose his security clearance. (GE 2 \nat 5)  \nAt the hearing, he was fearful about losing his security clearance and being \nunable to serve his country. He did not want to be considered a drug user. (Tr. 69-70) \nLater in the hearing, Applicant considered the reason for omitting the information was a \nlapse of judgment that he will not repeat in future because of his more focused \nunderstanding of providing truthful answers drug the security investigation, and his \nresponsibilities in the security clearance arena. (Tr. 151-153) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation for 2020 demonstrates that he is an \nexcellent communicator and takes pride in his work. He is congratulated for working full \ntime while attending school. (AE K) \nMr. A, a data manager who supervises Applicant, testified that he has known \nhim professionally since April 2023.

(Tr. 154-159) \nMr. B is employed by the United States Air Force (USAF) and has a security \nclearance. He testified that he has known Applicant for approximately three years. They \nbelong to the same skateboarding organization. Mr. B considers Applicant to be a good \nperson who used marijuana for medical purposes. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s bouts of \ndepression, but believes he is receiving the treatment he needs from the VA. His \nknowledge of the contents of the SOR does not affect Mr. B\u2019s favorable opinion of \nApplicant\u2019s honesty and reliability. (Tr. 159-166) \nMrs. C, a budget analyst for the United States Army (USA), testified that she \nmet Applicant three or four years ago when Applicant started dating her niece. Even \nwith her knowledge of the SOR, she still believes Applicant merits a security clearance. \nMrs. C has not seen Applicant under the influence of marijuana in over a year. After he \ncompleted drug rehabilitation, he began attending church. Mrs. C contacts Applicant \nperiodically to show support for him. (Tr. 167-174) \nMr. F, a regional manager of a mentoring organization, met Applicant in 2019 \nwhen he signed up to become a mentor for young men, ages 12 to 18. He mentors \nindividuals through guidance and helping them with their studies. Mr. F\u2019s knowledge of \nthe SOR has no effect on his favorable opinion of Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. \nMr. F and Applicant are members of two accountability groups, one 12 members in total \nand another smaller group, that interact on daily or a quarterly basis to discuss each \nother\u2019s challenges and struggles. Mr. F has seen no sign of Applicant being under the \ninfluence of marijuana in the last year. (Tr. 174-180) \nSeveral individuals supplied character statements in support of Applicant. In \nSeptember 2023, the regional coordinator for veteran services, indicated that when he \nwas a peer specialist between 2016 and 2021, Applicant worked hard to accomplish the \nmentoring goals set in meetings. In addition to his testimony, Mr. F provided a character \nstatement lauding Applicant\u2019s commitment to the youth in the regional community. Mr. G \nhas known Applicant for 20 years and watched him make tough decisions. Mr. G \nconsults him on personal and professional matters. (AE H) \nThe addiction therapist who issued the certificate of completion by Applicant of \nthe drug treatment program in September 2023 (AE J), provided a character statement \nattributing Applicant successful completion of the treatment program to his motivation \nand desire to reach abstinence. (AE O at 1) In two undated letters, two former veterans \nand current coworkers commended Applicant\u2019s work ethic and the sense and stability \nhe brings to his current employment. (AE O at 2 and 3) \nOn December 2, 2023, Applicant\u2019s current spiritual advisor met Applicant in \ncollege in 2000.

(AE O at 5) \nOn February 20, 2024, Applicant\u2019s aunt furnished a statement indicating that \nshe speaks with Applicant every six weeks. She is confident that he is trustworthy. She \nhas watched him turn his life around by receiving help for his depression. She has not \nseen him under the influence of marijuana for about a year. (AE P at 1) \nApplicant\u2019s close friend is a mentor in the same group with Applicant. They \nworship together. The friend has talked with Applicant about his circumstances. \nApplicant attends counseling and therapy. (AE P at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s father, a tax agent, contacts Applicant daily. His father considers \nApplicant reliable and trustworthy. He has not used marijuana for a while. His father is \naware that Applicant lied on the security application. In the last year, Applicant has \nmade positive changes in his life. (AE P at 3) \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a school teacher. She opined that his life was in turmoil \nwhen he returned from deployment in August 2012. In the last year, she has seen \npositive changes in his lifestyle because he stopped drinking and using illegal drugs. \nProving false answers on the security clearance form is customarily not Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to avoid telling the truth. As noted earlier, Applicant never tried to commit \nsuicide during his youth. (AE P at 4) \nAnother member of the USN, who served with Applicant, was honorably \ndischarged in November 2015. She has maintained contact with him over the years. \nShe was present when Applicant tried to commit suicide by ingesting the pills in \nNovember 2012, and being transferred to the hospital. She concluded that his \ncommand did not care about him. He deserves a second chance because of the \ngenuine remorse he has demonstrated for lying on the e-QIP. He has not used \nmarijuana in close to a year. He is closely engaged in counseling and the church. (AE P \nat 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nPsychological Conditions \nThe security concern under the psychological conditions guideline is set forth in \nAG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder \nis not required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly \nqualified mental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or \npsychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment, \nshould \nbe \nconsulted \nwhen \nevaluating \npotentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline and an \nopinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of mental health counseling. \nThe circumstances of this case may raise the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 28: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered  under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, \nincluding, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, \nparanoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful exploitative, or \nbizarre behaviors;   \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental heath professional that an \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) applies to the circumstances of this case due to the suicide ideation \nthat occurred in 1999, and the three suicide attempts between November 2012 and \nOctober 2021. Applicant\u2019s behavior raises questions about his judgment and reliability. \nAG 28(b) is applicable based on the June 2022 opinion the Government \npsychologist (Dr. L), a duly qualified mental health professional, that Applicant has a \nmental condition that may impair his judgment and reliability. In July 2022, Dr. M, \n11 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mental health professional who is a psychologist, reached the same \nconclusion that Applicant has a mental condition that may impair his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is applicable to Applicant\u2019s voluntary and involuntary and inpatient \ntreatments. \nAG \u00b6 29. Conditions that could mitigate the security concerns include: \n(a) the identified conditions is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable diagnosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified medical professional employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s \nprevious condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological and/or psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nOf the five potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) have some \napplication to the circumstances. AG \u00b6 29(a) applies based on Applicant\u2019s acceptance \nof his continuing need for treatment and credible commitment to compliance with his \ntreatment plan. Since his discharge from inpatient treatment in October 2021, he has \nreceived regular therapy from an FNP, supplemented by consistent psychiatric \ncounseling. This regular therapy comports with the therapeutic recommendations that \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist (Dr. M) recommended in her July 2022 report. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) applies to the consistent treatment Applicant has had since July \n2021. He provided credible testimony that he is committed to continued treatment and \nmedication to keep his mental condition under control. Though Dr. M conducted more \npsychological and psychiatric testing of Applicant than Dr. L, the record shows that Dr. L \nspent a significant amount of time conversing with his FNP about his improvement since \nhis last hospitalization in October 2021. While neither the Government\u2019s psychologist \n(Dr. L) nor the Applicant\u2019s psychologist (Dr. M) offered a favorable prognosis, \nApplicant\u2019s FNP told Dr. L. that his continued compliance with his medication was \n12 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nessential to maintain control over his mental condition. The record shows that Applicant \nhas several sources of support, including a spiritual counselor, fellow mentors, his \nfamily, friends, and his church, that he can contact should he have a florid episode in \nthe future. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of the Director of \nNational Intelligence Memorandum (October 25, 2014), Adherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use, which clearly states that state laws do not authorize persons \nto violate federal laws, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 \n(1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled drug. \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not change the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard of the \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations.  \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Disregard of federal law relevant to marijuana use (including \nprior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but not determinative to \nadjudications of security clearance eligibility. Agencies are required to employ the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \n13 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana from November 2013 to June 2023, meets \nthe definition of AG \u00b6 25(a). In order to use the drug, Applicant had to possess it as \ndefined by AG \u00b6 25(c). AG \u00b6 25(f) applies because he started using marijuana in \nNovember 2013, after he was granted a security clearance or a sensitive position in \n2010. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant indicated his last use of marijuana occurred in June 2023, with no \nintent to use the drug in the future. This latest declaration of abstinence must be \nevaluated contextually with his promise to his command in December 2013, that he \nwould refrain from all future drug use, his false claim that he used no marijuana \nbetween 2013 and 2019, when he continued to use marijuana throughout the period, \n14 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand his fallacious claim in August 2020, that he did not intend to use the drug in the \nfuture. In sum, his past failed promises undermine the credibility of most recent \nassertion and raise continuing doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant is strengthening his commitment to \nforego use of marijuana in the future. However, with his history of marijuana use, eight \nmonths of abstinence is too brief to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under this mitigating \ncondition. In addition, Applicant did not submit a signed statement of intent to abstain or \nface revocation of security clearance eligibility for future drug involvement. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \n26(b), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) do not fully apply to mitigate Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug use. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation or further processing for \nnational security eligibility.  \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation, relevant to national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant demonstrated poor judgment and unreliability when he intentionally \nconcealed his illegal drug use, his illegal drug use while holding a security clearance, \nand his omission of suicidal ideation in 1999 and the inpatient treatment events from his \n15 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 2020 e-QIP. He exacerbated his deliberate omissions in his August 2020 PSI by \nproviding incomplete and false information about his drug use. \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nAlthough Applicant revealed in his August 2020 PSI that his initial use of \nmarijuana in November 2013 resulted in an NJP in December 2013, he provided a \ndishonest account of his drug use subsequent to December 2013. Providing false \ninformation in an e-QIP or a PSI are not minor transgressions in a security clearance \ninvestigation because the DCSA CAS makes critical decisions as to an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness based on this information. Though Applicant appears to be in the \nright therapeutic situation to relieve his stressors and alleviate his inappropriate \nbehavior, the mitigation he receives under AG \u00b6 17(d) is insufficient to overcome the \nlack of persuasive evidence presented under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c). Therefore, AG \u00b6 \n15 is resolved against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for drug involvement in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n16 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 39 years old, and has been married since 2021. He has been \nemployed by his company since 2019, and his 2020 employment appraisal shows he \ndoes excellent work and takes pride in his work. In reaching my decision under the \nthree guidelines, I have also evaluated Applicant\u2019s age, his military service, the \nevidence of support from his friends, family, and counselors, his educational \nachievements, and his certificate of completion of the substance abuse course in \nSeptember 2023. \nOn the other side of the ledger, I have also considered Applicant\u2019s incomplete \naccount of his marijuana use since 2013. In 2021, he obtained a medical marijuana card \nto facilitate his purchase and use of the drug. He has used the drug for almost ten years \nwhile possessing a security clearance. His illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance, his falsification of his drug use from his e-QIP, and his falsification of portions \nof his drug use from his August 2020 PSI, have not been mitigated. Applicant has not \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines H and E. Conversely, he has \nmitigated the Guideline I security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n17 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all allegations in the SOR. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security clearance. He has been employed with his current employer since January 2022. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force from July 2015 to May 2021. He previously held a security clearance while on active duty. He was separated with an Under Honorable Conditions (General) discharge. He has some college credit but no degree.

When \nhe arrived, he observed Amn X sitting in a recliner with several lines of a white powdery \nsubstance on his iPad. Amn X used his CAC card to cut the powdery substance. Amn \nX then sniffed several lines of the white powdery substance.

He picked up the iPad and \ndumped the white powdery substance into a sink and washed it down the drain. He \nwiped the iPad and the CAC card with a towel in order to remove his fingerprints. He \nalso removed his garbage from the room to include a water bottle and tobacco in an \nattempt to eliminate his presence in Amn X\u2019s room. He left and drove home. While \ndriving home, he called Amn X and left a message stating that he had fallen asleep and \nto call him. He later deleted all content form his phone before the OSI confiscated it. (Tr. \n21; GE 5 at 16) \nThe next day, June 3, 2020, Applicant attempted to call Amn X around 1130. He \ndid not answer his phone. Applicant felt terrible because he did not help Amn X when he \noverdosed. He was selfish and was scared he could get into trouble for letting Amn X \nuse narcotics. Applicant called another friend, Amn Z, who went to check on Amn X. He \nsaw that Amn X was sitting still in his recliner in the window and looked pale. He \ncontacted his chain of command. They obtained a master key and went into Amm X\u2019 s \nroom. They discovered Amn X sitting on his recliner. He was deceased. (GE 5 at 16)  \nLater that day, special agents from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations \n(AFOSI) interviewed Applicant about Amn X. They were told during their initial \ninvestigation that Applicant and Amn X were good friends and co-workers. Applicant \nwas initially evasive during the interview. He mentioned that he went to Amn X\u2019s room \nthe evening of June 2, 2020. Amn X appeared fine. They were watching a television \nshow. Amn X fell asleep and then Applicant went home. The next day he tried to call \nAmn X and he would not answer. He called his friend Amn Z and asked him to check on \nAmn X. Amn Z observed Amn X through the window and observed that he appeared \ndead. (AE 5 at 13) \nApplicant told AFOSI that he usually communicated with Amn X via text \nmessages, but would not consent to AFOSI\u2019s request to search his cell phone. After \nbeing confronted about the importance of getting detailed information about Amn X\u2019s \ndeath for his family. Applicant admitted he and deceased used illegally purchased \nXanax together on May 31, 2020. Applicant was then read his rights under Article 31, \nUCMJ. He waived his right to legal counsel and elected to answer questions. He \nadmitted to his illegal purchase and use of marijuana and cocaine while on active duty \nin the military and provided the full details of what occurred on the night of June 2, 2020. \n(GE 5 at 14-16) \nA search of the Amn X\u2019s iPhone revealed texts from Applicant. On June 3, 2020, \nApplicant was escorted by AFOSI to have his blood and urine tested pursuant to a \nsearch warrant. While driving to the hospital, Applicant stated, \u201cI watched [Amn X] \noverdose and I ran away like a coward.\u201d An autopsy was performed on Amn X. His \ncause of death was accidental mixed drug intoxication. He had cocaine, fentanyl and \nXanax in his body at the time of his death.

(AE C). On February 20, 2023, he took a drug test. The drug test \nwas negative for illegal substances. (AE D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d \naddressing concerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states \nand the District of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local \nlaws do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use, but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus, knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \nOn December 21, 2021, The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana use. Specifically, prior recreational marijuana \nuse by an individual may be relevant to adjudications, but it is not determinative. \nRelevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and if the individual can \ndemonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or \nother such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing federal law \nand policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a \nsecurity clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nwork-force employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once the individual \nsigns the certification contained in the Standard Form (SF 86), Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admits to using marijuana in approximately January 2016 while on \nvacation in Amsterdam. While marijuana is legal in Amsterdam, Applicant was on active \nduty in the Air Force. The use of marijuana by an active duty member is strictly \nforbidden and is a criminal violation under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), \nArticle 112a, wrongful use of controlled substances. He admits he used and purchased \ncocaine on two occasions between January 2016 to December 2017 and that he \nwrongfully used Xanax on or about June 1, 2020. The actual date of use was May 31, \n2020. Each of these uses occurred when Applicant was on active duty in the United \nStates Air Force while he possessed a security clearance and held a sensitive position. \nAG \u00b6 25(a), AG \u00b6 25(c) and AG \u00b6 25(f) apply. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(c) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram, including, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare \nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Applicant chose to purchase and use marijuana and \ncocaine on several occasions in 2016 and 2017. On May 31, 2020, he illegally used \nXanax without a prescription. He was on active duty in the United States Air Force when \nhe used and purchased the illegal drugs. He was also entrusted with a security \nclearance and held a sensitive position. While more than three and half years have \npassed since his last known illegal use of a drug, questions remain about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. The military has strict standards about \nillegal drug use. Applicant\u2019s deliberate violation of those standards raise questions \nabout his trustworthiness and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. While Applicant provided proof of a negative urine \nsample taken in February 2023, it was not recent. While Applicant indicated he no \nlonger intended to use illegal drugs, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(c) does not apply. Applicant did not attend any drug counseling. His \nillegal drug abuse while on active duty in the Air Force was more than experimental use. \nHe purchased the marijuana and cocaine while in a foreign country. On both occasions \nwhen he purchased cocaine, it was from a stranger who approached him. Even his use \nof Xanax in May 2020 was questionable. I am not certain that Applicant fully disclosed \nthe extent of his drug abuse. A favorable prognosis on his drug abuse from a duly \nqualified medical personnel would have been helpful to make that assessment. \nOverall, Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use while on active duty in the Air \nForce and while possessing a security clearance and/or holding a sensitive position \nmade him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence \nentity or other individual or group. His illegal purchase and use of marijuana in 2016 and \ncocaine on two occasions between 2016 and 2017 is aggravated by the fact that he was \nin a foreign country at the time. \nWhen Applicant observed his friend Amn X begin to overdose, he made a choice \nto protect himself rather than calling for help which potentially could have saved Amn \nX\u2019s life. Instead, he chose to clean all evidence of the illegal drugs in the room and \nremove all of his personal trash in the room before leaving, because he did not want to \nget in trouble for not reporting Amn X\u2019s illegal drug use. As of result of these actions, he \nwas tried by Summary Courts-Martial in 2021 and pled guilty to criminal offenses under \nthe UCMJ in violation of Article 112a, wrongfully using controlled substances and Article \n131b, obstruction of justice. He was subsequently discharged with an Under Honorable \nConditions (General) discharge. His actions, if known, could affect his personal, \nprofessional or community standing. \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply.

Applicant disclosed the extent of his illegal drug use \nto AFOSI during the investigation after Amn X\u2019s death. He reduced his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation or duress. \nWhile Applicant has reduced his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, the concerns in this case are more about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use while on active duty and more importantly, \nhis actions on the night Amn X began to overdose continue to raise doubts about his \ntrustworthiness. Personal Conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, is set out in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern. \nThe following apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \nevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted \nAG \u00b6 31(b) applies to Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use and his obstruction of \njustice on the night Amn X began to overdose. In April 2021, he pled and was \nfound guilty of Article 112a, wrongful use of controlled substances, and Article \n131b, obstruction of justice at a Summary Courts-Martial. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists the conditions that could mitigate security concerns under \ncriminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): There is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including \nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal \nactivity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or \n11 \n AG \u00b6 31(b) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nprobation, job training or higher education, good employment \nrecord, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. Questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness remain despite the passage of time. Individuals entrusted with a \nsecurity clearance are expected to follow rules and obey laws. Applicant violated \nthose rules on several occasions while he was on active duty in the Air Force and \nwhile he held a security clearance. Clearance holders are also required to self-\nreport adverse information, even when it may be harmful to themselves. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to leave Amn X\u2019s room while Amn X was overdosing and \nbefore leaving, to remove any items that would place him in Amn X\u2019s room \ncontinues to raise questions about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) applies because Applicant is well-regarded in his current \nposition. However, it does not fully mitigate the concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct while on active duty. Rather than call for medical assistance, \nApplicant took action to cover up the fact that he was in Amn X\u2019s room. \nQuestions remain under criminal conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character references from his supervisors. \nHowever, security concerns remain due to Applicant\u2019s questionable trustworthiness and \nreliability while on active duty in the United State Air Force. His illegal drug use in 2016, \n2017 and May 2020 and his obstruction of justice on the night Amn X overdosed raise \nsignificant concerns. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

On October 24, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency, Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a statement of \nreasons (SOR) to Applicant under Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, \n1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the CAS did not find under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue eligibility to \nhold a public trust position for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked.

On February 8, 2023, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On February \n13, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. \nOn February 16, 2023, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for March 21, 2023. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which I received into evidence. Applicant testified and offered \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through G, which I received into evidence. On March 29, 2023, \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \nAdministrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice concerning Belarus, Russia, \nand Kyrgyzstan. Applicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice \nused for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July \n12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. \n02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd.

Usually administrative notice at ADP proceedings is accorded to facts \nthat are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, \nSection 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice concerning Belarus, \nRussia, and Kyrgyzstan contained in Administrative Notice (AN) Exhibits I, II, and III. \n \nThe facts are summarized in the written requests and will not be repeated verbatim \nin this decision. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence reported that Russia \npresents one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States, using its \nintelligence services, proxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to divide Western \nalliances, and increase its sway around the world, while attempting to undermine U.S. \nglobal standing, amplify discord inside the United States, and influence U.S. voters and \ndecisions making. On September 21, 2022, the Russian government began a mobilization \nof its citizens to the armed forces in support of its invasion of Ukraine. Russia may refuse \nto acknowledge dual nationals\u2019 U.S. citizenship, deny their access to U.S. consular \nassistance, prevent their departure from Russia, and conscript dual nationals for military \nservice. It also has human rights problems, and it has been victimized by terrorism. \nBelarus has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia than has any of \nthe other Soviet republics. Continuing concerns for Kyrgyzstan include the trajectory of \ndemocratization, endemic corruption, a history of tense, and at times violent, interethnic \nrelations, border security vulnerabilities, and potential terrorist threats. See AN Exhibits I \nthrough III for further details describing U.S. concerns pertaining to these three countries, \nespecially with regard to Russia. \nWhere appropriate, I have taken administrative notice of updated and current \ninformation from the State Department website regarding the current geopolitical \nsituation, consistent with my obligation to make assessments based on timely information \nin cases involving the potential for foreign influence.

They had a condominium that \nthey gave to his mother-in-law, where she lives today. (Tr. 55-57) Before moving to the \nUnited States, Applicant worked in the information technology field. He did not serve in \nthe Russian military, nor did he work for the Russian government. (Tr. 67-68) \nApplicant and his wife have two children, their Russian-born 13-year-old daughter, \nand their six-year-old U.S.-born daughter. Applicant\u2019s wife is not employed outside the \nhome. (Tr. 18-19, 70; GE 1) \nApplicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens in November 2021. His \n13-year-old daughter became a naturalized U.S. citizen shortly afterwards, and his six-\nyear-old daughter is a U.S. citizen by birth. (Tr. 19-21, 71; GE 1) Applicant was issued a \nU.S. passport in February 2022 that expires in February 2032. He also holds a Russian \npassport issued to him in August 2015 that expires in August 2025. (Tr. 21-22) Applicant\u2019s \nwife also has a Russian passport as well as a U.S. passport. His oldest daughter only has \na Russian passport. Neither daughter has a U.S. passport because there is no current \nneed for them to have one.  (Tr. 22-23) Applicant\u2019s youngest daughter acquired Russian \ncitizenship from her parents; however, Applicant has not taken any steps towards having \nher Russian citizenship formally recognized by the Russian government. (Tr. 71-72) \nAs noted, Applicant was educated in Russia.

(Applicant\u2019s father retired from the Soviet Navy and passed away \nin 1998 when Applicant was a teenager. Applicant and the rest of the family lived separate \nand apart from his father since he was ten years old. Applicant only remembers his father \nas a retiree.) (Tr. 34-37; GE 1) \nApplicant has not had any meaningful communication with his mother since 2007, \nfollowing a conflict that developed around the time of his wedding. One of the sources of \nconflict between Applicant and his mother was her unwillingness to care for his daughter \nwhen he lived in Russia. The last time Applicant saw his mother was in 2016 at a family \nget together before Applicant and his family left for the United States. Applicant has not \nspoken to his mother since then. He does not have her contact information and if he \nwanted to speak to her, he would use one of his siblings as an intermediary. (Tr. 46-48, \n60-62) \nBrother #1 - Applicant has a 41-year-old brother who is about a year younger than \nhe is. Brother # 1 is employed as a software engineer in Russia. His brother is married \nand has two children. His wife, Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law, \u201cwas an engineer for some kind \nof appliance company or something, but I never really asked about it.\u201d (Tr. 37-40; GE 1) \nApplicant last saw his brother in 2016 before he left Russia.

Applicant \nand his wife also volunteer at a local animal rescue facility. (Tr. 74-75) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance [or a public trust position].\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access \nto classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See \nId. at 527. \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available \ninformation, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, \nvulnerabilities, and \ntrustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable \neligibility or access determination may be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance [or access to \nsensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the trustworthiness concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests,\u201d \nstating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business,\nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result\nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they\ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and\ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his immediate family members and mother-in-law in \nRussia, and to a lesser extent the presence of his Belarusian father-in-law in Kyrgyzstan, \ncreate \u201ca heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d and \u201ca potential conflict of interest between [his] obligation to protect classified \nor sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help a foreign person, group, or \ncountry by providing that information or technology.\u201d The nature and scope of intelligence \noperations conducted by those countries and their overt antagonism to U.S. and western \nnational security interests create these heightened concerns due to the vulnerable \npositions of those family members, and their natural affection and affinity with Applicant \nand his wife. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nFor Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the foreign government involved and the \nintelligence-gathering history of that government are among the important considerations \nthat provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the \n[Administrative] Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights \nrecord is another important consideration.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (May 15, \n2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). Another important \nconsideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the United States. \nThese factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nliving in that country are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, terrorism causes a substantial amount of death or property \ndamage, or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the \nUnited States. The relationships of Russia and to a lesser extent Belarus and Kyrgyzstan \nwith the United States, and the conditions in those countries place a significant burden of \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his contacts with those foreign nationals do \nnot pose a trustworthiness risk because of the risks of attempts to influence him \nemanating from those countries. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he \nmight be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and concerns that may \narise from entities in Russia, Belarus, or Kyrgyzstan. \nThe issue in this case is whether Applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with foreign \nnationals create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to exploit in an \neffort to get unauthorized access to U.S. sensitive information that he will have if his public \ntrust eligibility is approved. Guideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not \nlimited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding sensitive information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from or in Russia, Belarus,\nor Kyrgyzstan seek or have sought sensitive or economic information from or through \nApplicant personally, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out the risks of such a \npossibility in the future. Applicant\u2019s contacts with foreign nationals in those countries \n\u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek \nU.S. information or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with foreign nationals in Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because those foreign nationals or foreign officials \nwith knowledge of Applicant\u2019s contacts in those countries could place pressure, directly \nor indirectly, on Applicant in an effort to cause him to compromise sensitive information. \nThose relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence \nof Applicant\u2019s relationships with foreign nationals and has established resulting concerns \nover potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and \nfurther inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant had limited contacts with his immediate family members in Russia and \nmore frequent contacts with his mother-in-law directly or through his wife. Even though \nsuch contacts with his immediate relatives are infrequent, one cannot overlook the fact \nthat those contacts are with immediate relatives as opposed to distant relatives or \nsomeone he is related to by marriage. His mother-in-law is someone with whom Applicant, \nhis wife, and children enjoy a close relationship and who has visited Applicant\u2019s family in \nthe United States four times since 2016. \nApplicant has worked in the information technology field the majority of his working \nlife and from all accounts is highly qualified and skilled in his profession. Were his identity \nand skill set discovered, the fact that he has relatives in Russia and Kyrgyzstan could place \nhim in an untenable position. This is especially true given the history of Russian operatives \nas described in AN Exhibit II and the wide-ranging influence tools they have utilized to \nfurther their interests. Such contacts are relevant for mitigation and whole-person \nassessments. \nAs indicated in the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions section, supra, \nApplicant had multiple connections and contacts with relatives in Russia and to a lesser \nextent with his father-in-law in Kyrgyzstan. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has \nsignificant connections to the United States. I recognize that Applicant has made the \nUnited States his home and is a productive and law-abiding citizen. However, his familial \nconnections in Russia and Kyrgyzstan cannot be overlooked or minimized. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his relatives, particularly \nthose in Russia. Applicant\u2019s cumulative connections to them vary in degree and are \nongoing, and his connections to the United States are insufficient to overcome the foreign \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninfluence trustworthiness concerns under Guideline B at this time. This is particularly true \ngiven the degradation of relations between the United States and Russia since the onset \nof the war with Ukraine, which is ongoing. None of the mitigating conditions are fully \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior systems administrator, who has been employed \nby a defense contractor since February 2022. He seeks a public trust position to perform \nhis duties and presumably, if granted a public trust position, would be eligible to perform \na wider range of duties with increased responsibility. Applicant is highly educated, \nknowledgeable, and qualified in the information technology field. His employment record \nin the United States has been exemplary. His employers laud him in all respects. In short, \nhe would be an asset to any employer. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his foreign relatives vary but can be considered relatively \nrecent and ongoing. These connections raise significant foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns. A Guideline B decision concerning Russia, Belarus, and Kyrgyzstan must take \ninto consideration the geopolitical situation and dangers involving those countries. See \nISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person \ndiscussion). Those countries are dangerous places because of violence from terrorists \nand criminals, and their governments do not respect the full spectrum of human rights. \nThey aggressively target the United States to obtain a technology advantage over \nwestern nations. The roles of their governments, rivalries with the United States, and \nactions of their intelligence services cause heightened and serious trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThe relationship between Russia and the United States has deteriorated notably \nsince the onset of the war between Russia and Ukraine. As AN Exhibit II amply explains, \nRussia has been known to use coercive and unorthodox methods to further its interests. \nIt would not be in the national interest of the United States to place Applicant in a \npotentially compromising position where he would have to balance his loyalties between \nthe United States and the safety of his relatives. Perhaps if the geopolitical situation \nbetween the respective countries improves, Applicant\u2019s situation can be reevaluated. This \noutcome should in no way be construed to suggest that Applicant is anything but a loyal \nand productive U.S. citizen; however, given the current state of affairs granting him \nnational security eligibility and exposing him to sensitive protected information is not \nadvisable or appropriate. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility or eligibility for a public trust position, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance or public trust position. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at \n1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant did not mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. \nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nRobert Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Background Applicant is a 23-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her employer since about August 2019. She is a highly regarded employee as evidenced by her manager\u2019s letter of support, positive feedback from her colleagues, evaluation comments, and employee statistics rating. (AE B; AE C; AE E; AE H.) Her employer has placed her in a position of responsibility handling sensitive applications, and she has received compliments from those her work supports. (Tr. at 74; GE 1; AE B; AE C.) In addition to her current employer, she recently has started working again for her father\u2019s company, which she reported this work to her security team. She also worked for her father in high school. (Tr. at 73.) Applicant graduated high school in June 2019 with a 4.2 grade point average and an early college scholar agreement. After graduating high school, she attended community college until October 2019. (GE 1; AE G.) She married in April 2020 at age 19. The couple lived in a small one-bedroom apartment during COVID. She testified she experienced emotional abuse and some physical abuse during the marriage, which was very stressful for Applicant. She separated from her husband in early 2022, and their divorce was finalized in the Spring of 2023 (Tr. at 20-21; GE 1.)

She has worked for her \nemployer since about August 2019. She is a highly regarded employee as evidenced by her \nmanager\u2019s letter of support, positive feedback from her colleagues, evaluation comments, \nand employee statistics rating. (AE B; AE C; AE E; AE H.) Her employer has placed her in \na position of responsibility handling sensitive applications, and she has received \ncompliments from those her work supports. (Tr. at 74; GE 1; AE B; AE C.) In addition to her \ncurrent employer, she recently has started working again for her father\u2019s company, which \nshe reported this work to her security team. She also worked for her father in high school. \n(Tr. at 73.) \nApplicant graduated high school in June 2019 with a 4.2 grade point average and an \nearly college scholar agreement. After graduating high school, she attended community \ncollege until October 2019. (GE 1; AE G.) She married in April 2020 at age 19. The couple \nlived in a small one-bedroom apartment during COVID. She testified she experienced \nemotional abuse and some physical abuse during the marriage, which was very stressful for \nApplicant. She separated from her husband in early 2022, and their divorce was finalized in \nthe Spring of 2023 (Tr. at 20-21; GE 1.) \nMental Health Treatment \nApplicant first sought mental health treatment in about November 2020 after her \nsuicide attempt. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) As a youth she suffered from mental health issues triggered by \na harsh home environment and being sexually assaulted as an early teen. (GE at 32-33.) \nShe experienced suicidal ideation since age seven and has attempted suicide approximately \n20 to 30 times. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Given her home environment she did not have the support from \nher family going through these events as a child. (Tr. at 39.) It was not until November 2020 \nafter she was hospitalized for five days after her suicide attempt that she first began mental \nhealth treatment. The COVID pandemic made it especially challenging to find a care \nprovider accepting new patients. In February 2021 she started treatment with X. (Tr. at 25-\n26; 41.) She had to decline the partial hospitalization program from the hospital because \nshe did not have the sick leave and she had to work in order for her to not lose her apartment. \nApplicant diligently sought to maintain a treatment plan while continuing to work and \ndeal with health insurance coverage and costs. Between November 2020 and February \n2021, during COVID, she was searching for a mental health care provider, she continued to \nget medication from the hospital where she had been hospitalized. (Tr. 41.) She was looking \nfor a therapist but schedules, therapy styles, and cost were constraints. (Tr. at 44.) \nIn February 2021, Applicant contacted the police because she did not feel safe at her \nhome and was transported to a crisis center. Her husband was yelling at her and when \nthings got tense her husband would block her from leaving the apartment. He physically held \nher to stop her from leaving their apartment. The only place she could go to get out of the \nsituation was the bathroom where she could lock the door. She called 911. The police were \nconcerned about the situation and sent her to the crisis center based on her past history, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbut after speaking with the counselor there, they determined that her safety was not a \nconcern. She was able to pay the bill for the crisis center. (Tr. at 46.) After she was able to \nget out of her relationship with her abusive husband, her life improved dramatically. While \nthis personal situation was ongoing, she continued to work and excelled with her employer. \n(AE B; AE C; AE E; AE H.) \nApplicant was treated at a behavioral services practice, hereafter PT, from February \n2021 until February of 2022. (AE A.) At her final session with PT, she had her medication \nfilled through June of 2022. (Tr. at 47.) She was able to maintain her medication until she \nstarted seeing Dr. B (counsel and the Applicant refer to a psychiatric nurse practitioner as \nDr. B throughout the hearing) in approximately September 2022. Dr. B is a psychiatric nurse \npractitioner who specializes in treatment of adults and is able to provide medication \nmanagement for mental health disorders. Because Applicant\u2019s situation had improved, she \nhas not been seen as frequently by her care provider, now she has appointments generally \n60 to 90 days for maintenance. (Tr. at 49.) For medications she uses a weekly organizer to \ntrack her medications. She dispenses everything into each day, so it is easy for her to \nremember, and she does not miss prescribed dosages. (Tr. at 64.) \nApplicant testified she could barely afford rent alone and her medications, so \nadditional inpatient therapy was not an option for her. Since January 2022, she has lived \nwithout roommates, partners, or any type of financial support from others. She has \nmaintained all of her finances. She has been able to function and provide for herself. She \nmentioned in her psychological evaluation with the doctor from the DOD that the one thing \nholding her back from getting therapy was cost. (Tr. 43-44; AE D.) \nApplicant credibly testified about her struggles and how they improved once she was \nseparated from her husband. She acknowledged dealing with self-harm urges and passive \nsuicidal ideations. Both of these issues stopped shortly after separating from her husband. \nShe acknowledged living by herself for the first time took some adjusting. She explained her \npractice of using a journal to deal with her anxiety. In her journal she writes down her \nthoughts if she feels a panic attack coming on and then doing a follow up every 10, 15, 20 \nminutes to see how her mindset had improved. By going back and reading her notes and \nreflecting on them has enabled her to learn how to avoid the situation again. (Tr. at 52.) She \nstarted this practice while seeing PT. She has kept this journal since November 2020. She \nalso participates in weekly art therapy, which she finds relaxing. (Tr. at 53.) She has had no \nincidents of self-harm since the June of 2021 cutting incident. The last time she had even \npassive suicidal ideations was a few months after she separated from her husband in \nFebruary of 2022. (Tr. at 61.) Besides the prescribed activities, art therapy and writing, she \ndoes as much gardening as her apartment allows, as well as, cooking and cleaning to calm \nherself. She also maintains regular exercise schedule involving a combination of \nweightlifting, Pilates, and yoga. (Tr. at 68.) \nAs part of Applicant\u2019s treatment, she was prescribed a service animal, a cat, by a \nnurse practitioner at PT. The animal is certified but limited to her residence for emotional \nsupport. She has had the cat for two years. The animal's presence is very relaxing and \ncomforting by its warmth and purring. She testified the cat is like the art therapy or journaling, \nwhich has helped her deal with her anxiety.

Her parents live locally, and she normally \nvisits her parents every weekend. She also started working parttime again with her father. \nShe sees her sisters a little less, approximately a couple times a month. She described \nissues with her older sister growing up that have been resolved so that they have a \u201cperfectly \nfine relationship.\u201d (Tr. at 54.) Besides family and work she sees some friends outside of work \noccasionally. (Tr. at 64.) \nApplicant relies on Dr. B\u2019s December 2022 assessment. Dr. B met with her in the fall \nof 2022 and reviewed Applicant\u2019s file. In addition to the assessment, Dr. B continued her \nmedication regime she had been on since PT. (Tr. at 58.) The coping mechanisms have \nhelped her with her anxiety so that she has not taken that medication in the past year. (Tr. \nat 58.) In 2020, she did not have a good support network, she has worked on becoming \nmore involved and now has a good support network and has a treatment program, which \nincludes medication management for mental health disorders. (Tr. at 37, 49 76; AE F.) \nDOD Psychological Evaluation - June 2022 \nThe DOD requested that Applicant undergo a psychological evaluation. The \nevaluation was conducted on June 6, 2022, by a licensed psychologist (hereinafter referred \nto as psychologist or DOD psychologist) who was contracted from private practice by the \nDOD. The whole appointment lasted for approximately an hour to an hour and a half. (Tr. at \n68.) A report of the evaluation was prepared on June 22, 2022. (GE 3.) \nThe psychologist\u2019s evaluation included a review of background information, including \nmental health treatment records provided by the DOD. Applicant\u2019s most recent SCA. \nAdditional data was collected via clinical interview and observations and administration of \nthe Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nChecklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Health (DSM-5), PCL-5. (GE \n3 at 1.) At the evaluation the psychologist described Applicant\u2019s thought content as normal \nwith no psychotic features noted. She was forthcoming, respectful, and cooperative during \nthe evaluation. The psychologist described Applicant\u2019s insight as intact and her judgment as \ngood and that she answered all questions asked of her. The psychologist noted her \nresponses to questions were adequate and informative and she did not appear to be making \nattempts at deception during the evaluation. (GE 3 at 4.) During the testing part of the \nevaluation the psychologist noted there was no evidence to suggest that Applicant was \ntrying to portray herself as being relatively free of common shortcomings or minor faults to \nportray herself in a more negative or pathological light than the clinical picture would warrant. \n(GE 3 at 5.) The psychologist diagnosed her \u201cwith Post-traumatic-stress disorder, chronic, \nand Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, conditions that could pose a significant risk to \n[her] judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Due \nto a lack of well-established coping skills and a lack of medical opinion from [her] current \nprovider, [her] prognosis is guarded.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \nConsistent with her own medical records Applicant reported to the DOD several \nsuicide attempts while she was a child but not reported to family until the November 2020 \nattempt, which resulted in her hospitalization. She described the harsh family life and \nrelationship with her mother and older sister when she was a preteen.

These relationships provide a relatively intact \nsocial support system and are a favorable sign for future adjustment. (GE 3 at 6.) \nThe DOD psychologist noted Applicant\u2019s past psychiatric difficulties cannot be a basis \nfor vulnerability to blackmail, pressure, or coercion because her history is well known to \nothers in her life. The psychologist noted Applicant appeared to be complying with her \ncurrent treatment recommendations and had acknowledged symptoms of depression, \nanxiety, and noted that she has continued to experience passive symptoms of suicidal \nthoughts. The psychologist noted that due to a lack of information, she did not have objective \ninformation concerning the subject's treatment progress over the past year and her \nprognosis in terms of risk recurrence. (GE 3 at 7.) \nThe record shows Applicant was generally consistent in her clinical interviews and \nself-report measures concerning her history of sexual abuse, suicidal ideations, suicide \nattempts, and self-harm. After separating from her husband, she is no longer having passive \nsuicidal ideations or self-harm urges and no suicide attempts since the November 2020 \nincident. (Tr. at 50, 51-52; 53; AE A at 7.) Her current care provider signed the DOD form \naffirming that she does not have a condition that could impair her judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. (AE F.) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June \n8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal \nis a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process \nis a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis Guideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on \nthe basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) \nbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient treatment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a)-(c) have been established by the facts of this case. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, \nor acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s \nprevious condition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability \nof recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer has indications of emotional \ninstability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. \ndenied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising \nsecurity concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those \nconcerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is partially applicable. Applicant after her 2020 suicide attempt sought out \nand was responsive to treatment for her major depressive disorder and suicidal ideations in \n2020. She has a regime for taking her medication and attended mostly weekly, but sometimes \nbi-weekly, counseling sessions with a therapist.

While Applicant has had difficulty with obtaining \ntreatment because of medical insurance, availability of mental health providers, and her work \nobligations, she still followed the recommended actions that would help her cope and deal \nwith stress. Applicant has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with her \ntreatment plan. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is not established. The DOD psychologist diagnosed her \u201cwith Post\u00ad\ntraumatic-stress disorder, chronic, and Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, conditions \nthat could pose a significant risk to [her] judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Due to a lack of well-established coping skills and a lack of \nmedical opinion from [her] current provider, [her] prognosis is guarded.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \nAlthough she is now attending therapy and Dr. B certified Applicant does not have a \ncondition that could impair her judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, there is no evidence \nDr. B is employed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government. \nAG \u00b6 29(d) does not apply. Appellant was diagnosed with PTSD, chronic, and Major \nDepressive Disorder, Recurrent. There is no evidence these conditions are temporary. \nAG \u00b6 29(e) applies. ISCR Case No. 20-02097 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2024) the Appeal \nBoard indicated lay statements about work performance could potentially establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 29(e). Applicant is aware what steps, based on her childhood trauma, she needs \nto take to manage her depression, which was compounded by her difficult marriage at a young \nage and was further exacerbated by the COVID pandemic living conditions. She has been \ndivorced for almost two years and no longer has contact with her husband. Her personal life \nis stable, and she has family support. Throughout this process, she has been honest about \nher mental health and interested in getting better. She has been attending counseling \nsessions for the last two years and takes her anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications. \nShe had the foresight to make sure she had a sufficient supply when she changed providers. \nApplicant\u2019s work and personal life after establishing her treatment plan have shown she has \nlearned to deal with her health concerns such that there is no indication of a current problem. \nShe has shown the requisite coping skills and her current medical care provider has stated \nshe does not have a condition that could impair her trustworthiness. \nApplicant successfully mitigated the psychological conditions security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has moved forward \nsince her divorce. She has taken steps to be more involved with others and obtained a \nsupport animal. Her work is highly thought of by her current supervisor and those she \nsupports. She has done the work to develop coping skills when she encounters situations \nthat cause her anxiety. I have no concerns about her reliability and trustworthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns raised under the Psychological Conditions Guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCharles C. Hale \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

The loan in SOR \u00b6 1.k appears to be directly from the school. (SOR; GE 2, 3, 4, \nand 6) \nApplicant enrolled in an associate degree program at a local college in 2016. He \ndid not complete the program and states he is four credit hours short of his associate \ndegree. In Section 26 of his SCA, he stated the \u201conly debt I have is school loans and im \n[sic] currently working on a way to get it situated.\u201d During his background interview on \nAugust 4, 2021, when asked about debts, he again stated he only had the student loans \nand that he was currently working on them. He also mentioned to the investigator that he \nhad been notified about a recent debt for a department store credit card for $231. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.j) \nApplicant stated he was unaware of total loan amounts until the OPM investigator \nprovided them during his interview.

He stated he did not currently have the paperwork \nconfirming the consolidation but thought he should be able to find the emails confirming \nthis and provide them. At the hearing, he stated he had begun payments of approximately \n$200 per month in September 2022. Again, he averred he would be able to provide the \nconfirmation emails. (SOR Answer; GE 4 at 1-3; Tr. at 57-60) \nThough Applicant failed to submit any documentation to support his statements at \nhis hearing, the October 2022 and August 2023 credit bureau reports (CBRs) seem to \nsupport his assertions regarding student loan consolidation. His August 2023 CBR has a \nlarge student loan that, by the amount ($14,603), appears to be a consolidated student \nloan. It was opened in June 2022, was in good standing and showed payments beginning \nin May 2023. However, the August 2023 CBR also shows five U.S. Department of \nEducation accounts listed as \u201ccollection account (Enhanced Trade Only),\u201d one with a \nbalance remaining of $2,567. A sixth U.S. Department of Education account ($3,717) is \nlisted as at least 120 days past due. It is unclear whether the student loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.f \u2013 1.g, and 1.k, are resolved. (GE 5 at 5-7; GE 6 at 3-7) \nPost-hearing and before the record closed, the Government submitted \nadministrative exhibits regarding the settlement in Sweet v. Cardona, No. 3:19-cv-3674 \n(N.D. Cal. (2022)), a class action settlement between the Department of Education and \nmembers of the class. The agreement affects the processing of U.S. Department of \nEducation student loan borrowers who filed borrower defense applications on or before \nJune 22, 2022. The school Applicant took out his loans to attend is one of the named \nschools. I take administrative notice that Applicant\u2019s university was listed in the case and \nthat the time frame the class action covered includes the time period Applicant took his \nclasses. When questioned during the hearing, Applicant stated he had not heard about \nthe class action. He was unsure whether he had been notified and stated he would have \nto check his e-mail. Applicant did state he had applied for one of the student loan \ndeferment programs but, again, provided no documentation and was unsure what \nprogram that might have been. (Tr. at 69-71) \nApplicant stated he let the consumer debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,000) slide when \nhe began to focus on the student loans. This was a credit account to help pay bills with \nhis mother. In his SOR answer he stated it was paid but at the hearing said he was making \nsporadic payments. This debt does not appear on Applicant\u2019s August 2023 CBR. It was \ncharged off in 2022. Applicant stated he would have emails to indicate its status and his \npayment history. This debt appears to be resolved. (Tr. at 46-47; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 5; \nGE 4 at 3GE 5 at 6; GE 6) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($271) was the result of an insurance dispute. \nApplicant stated he had just paid this shortly before the hearing. He also stated it was \npaid in his answer to the DOD interrogatories. He had no current documentation but \nstated he should have emails to support it. He did not know why he did not bring his \nemails. He credibly testified he had paid this debt. It does not appear on his October 2022 \nor August 2023 CBRs. This debt is resolved.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \ndefaulted student loans. While mostly small, he was not aware of some of his debts and \nwas unaware of the amounts of others. Applicant was given multiple opportunities to \nprovide supporting documentation (i.e., SOR answer, answer to interrogatories, at his \nhearing, and while the record remained open after the hearing) and failed to provide \nanything. Applicant stated he was only able to pay certain debts based on his income but \nhad taken no action regarding his debts prior to being notified by the OPM investigator \nthat his debts may be a concern. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant\u2019s student loans remain unpaid, though at least some may be in \nconsolidation and repayment. He appears to have paid off the smaller debts but provided \nno documentation. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply as some of his indebtedness continues and \nis, therefore, recent. \nIt is possible Applicant\u2019s student loans were the result of some level of predatory \nbehavior based on the Sweet v. Cardona settlement. However, Applicant states he is not \na member of the class and had not applied for relief and provided no documentation or \nstatements to indicate this was the case. Even though aware of the loan indebtedness as \nindicated by his answer in his SCA and his interview, he was unaware of the amount he \nowed and had taken no action on these loans until he was aware it was a security \nconcern.

Though he provided no supporting \ndocumentation, his October 2022 and August 2023 CBRs seem to support this. The \nAppeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present \ndocumentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at \n2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2006)). On the whole, however, regarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and 1.h \u2013 1.k, \nI find AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. The allegations are mitigated. \nApplicant stated he plans to pay all of his debts, including his student loans. \nHowever, intentions to resolve debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record \nof debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Based on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and what appears to \nhave been positive action, I believe with time he will likely establish a track record that \ncould lead to a different result. But that time has not quite yet arrived. \nWhile Applicant appears to be on the right track, there is insufficient evidence for \na determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable \nperiod. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he \nmade a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThough aware of his debts, he took no action to resolve them until on notice they were of \na concern. Should Applicant continue to handle his debts in the manner he appears to be \ndoing now, he will likely establish a record of good judgment. At this time, however, his \nfailure to provide any supporting documentation at any point in this process coupled with \nhis failure to take action sooner to resolve his debts, continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts regarding his student loans are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant had to travel to her mother\u2019s location, close down her house, and \nmove her to Applicant\u2019s location. In order to fund this, she took out a personal loan and \nused her credit cards.

While some of her \nmother\u2019s medical expenses were covered by Medicare, she did not qualify for Medicaid, \nso Applicant and her three siblings had to fund the remainder of their mother\u2019s \nexpenses. Applicant was the main financial contributor because she did not have a \nfamily to support like her siblings.

The CRS does not settle or assist in the payment of any delinquent \naccounts. While she did an initial credit evaluation, she did not receive financial \ncounseling from the CRS. She believes the service has helped raise her credit score. \n(Tr. 27-28, 43-45; AE B) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$17,611. This is a delinquent credit card.

Applicant used these cards for cash withdrawals and payments to fund her \nmother\u2019s move. They appear on her most recent credit report. She has several accounts \nfrom this creditor on her credit report and she claims she has paid and closed the \naccounts with account numbers ending in 4332 and 9030.

She admitted securing a car loan in \n2019 for her current partner\u2019s daughter. Applicant makes the $500 monthly payments, \nbut the daughter pays for her own insurance.

Her student loans are now out of the COVID-\nrelief period and she will have to start making payments on them. Her student loan \nbalance is approximately $31,000. The personal financial statement she completed in \nMay 2022, showed a net monthly remainder after expenses of $281. This did not \naccount for making any payments on her SOR debts or toward her student loans.

She explained that the SF-86 was completed \non a computer and it was prepopulated with information from her previous SF-86 form. \nShe made the appropriate changes, but apparently the information was not saved in the \nSF86\u2019s final form. Department Counsel indicated she was satisfied with Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation. (Tr. 36) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated 10 delinquent debts totaling approximately $64,000. With \nthe exception of paying two debts, she failed to address the remaining debts. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Except for two debts, Applicant has not \ndocumented payment towards any other SOR debts. While her family issues were \ncircumstances beyond her control, she has not shown responsible action toward \naddressing her delinquent debts. This is evident by her decision to finance a car for her \npartner\u2019s daughter rather than to address her delinquent debts. Her hiring of the CRS \ndoes not help pay her debts. None of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe Government failed to establish that Applicant deliberately falsified or \nprovided misleading answers on her May 2021 SF-86. She credibly asserted that she \nentered the correct information on the prepopulated SF-86 form, but for some reason \nthat information was not saved in the final document. Because no deliberate falsification \nwas established, it is unnecessary to explore the applicability of any mitigating \nconditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances. However, she has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of financial responsibility, which causes me to \nquestion her ability to resolve her debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.f, 1.i-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.g-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph: 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

There were no objections to any of the evidence, and Items 2 \nthrough 6 are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me on January 10, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. Her admissions are incorporated \ninto the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. She is not \nmarried and has no children. She works for a federal contractor, but it is unknown when \nshe started employment. It appears she also works part time at a restaurant. She did not \ndisclose any periods of unemployment in her September 2022 security clearance \napplication (SCA). (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts totaling approximately $33,195, owed for a \nrepossessed vehicle and various consumer and medical accounts. The debts are \nsupported by Applicant\u2019s admissions, disclosures in her SCA and interrogatories, and a \ncredit report from November 2022. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5) \nIn response to interrogatories from April 2023, Applicant acknowledged all the \nSOR debts. She indicated that she made payment arrangements for the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b ($3,461). She did not provide any supporting documents of the arrangement she \nmade or proof of any payments. (Item 4) \nIn response to interrogatory questions that asked Applicant to explain the \ncircumstances that caused her accounts to become delinquent, she stated that she did \nnot know the importance of financial stability. Her income has been an issue because she \nnever had a job that gave her financial stability. Her new job has allowed her to save and \nstart consolidating her debts. She said she started working with creditors to pay off her \nbills and her end goal is to have paid everything by 2025. She further stated that she paid \none debt (it was not alleged in the SOR).

(Item 4) \nApplicant did not provide any documentary evidence that she has contacted her \ncreditors, made payment arrangements and is working with her creditors, or made \npayments towards any of the SOR debts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s has numerous delinquent debts. None of the SOR debts alleged are \npaid or being resolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to underemployment and not \nunderstanding the importance of financial stability. Her underemployment was beyond \nher control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. \nApplicant has not provided evidence of any actions she has taken to resolve and pay any \nof her delinquent debts. Some of her debts are less than $60 and $120. AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. There is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling or of clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. There is no evidence that she \nhas made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. Her \ndebts remain unresolved and unpaid. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion under Guidelines F, financial \nconsiderations. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

He was then laid off, but would be hired back should he be able to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 38-42) \nPsychological Conditions \nApplicant has an extended history of mental health concerns. In September 2001, \nhe attempted suicide and was involuntarily hospitalized for about a week. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He \nblamed issues relating to his marriage as a cause for his mental health episode. No \ndiagnosis from that event is reflected in the medical record. He denied any history of \nmental health struggles prior to 2001. However, he testified that his family had a history \nof bipolar disorder and he always felt that he was also bipolar. After being released from \nthe hospital, he declined the recommended continuation of mental health treatment. \nMedical records reflect that he took medication for his mental health for an unknown \nperiod after the hospitalization, but he denied taking any mental health medication during \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat period. Soon afterwards, he separated from his first wife. He then moved in with his \nparents and lived with them for the next three years. (GX 1-4; AX C; Tr. 56-66)  \nAlthough he believed that he was likely bipolar based on his family history, he did \nnot seek additional treatment until his suicide ideation and hospitalization in 2016. \nInstead, during the fifteen-year break between events, he described regularly \nexperiencing mood swings and manic episodes where he would occasionally make \nimpulse purchases which would lead to financial stress. In 2007, he also experienced \nanger issues with his current wife, who he was living with prior to their marriage. When \nhis wife threatened to leave him, he did not seek out counseling. Instead, he took it upon \nhimself to change and claimed he was successful. (GX 2-4; AX C; Tr. 66-73) \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s anger issues remained. In 2009, he was terminated from his \nemployment for throwing papers onto a supervisor\u2019s desk. He denied that he threw \nanything, but admitted he was fired. He described struggling with completing the daily \nroutines of his work. (GX 1-3; Tr. 70-75, 95) \nIn December 2016, Applicant started with Company A, a bank. Later that month, \nhe felt an oncoming mental health \u201cbreak,\u201d told his wife, and was voluntarily hospitalized \nwith suicidal ideation. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder and, after \nabout 5 days, was released. When asked what caused the break, he could not recall \nanything specific. He began to see Dr. S for mental health treatment. Dr. S noted a past \nhistory of use and abuse of both hard drugs and alcohol, but that he was 21 years clean \nand eight years sober. This history would reflect drug use through about 1995 and alcohol \nuse through about 2008. (GX 1-4; AX C; Tr. 97-104) \nMedical records from 2017 reflect that Applicant saw Dr. S for depression, history \nof suicidal ideation and relationship concerns. In addition to his bipolar I disorder, he was \ndiagnosed with major depressive disorder. He continued to have difficulties processing \nfeelings of remorse and empathy. An August 2017 medical report noted that he exhibited \nsociopathic tendencies. In September 2017, he continued to experience suicidal ideation, \nbut it was infrequent and he claimed he had no reason to act on his thoughts. By \nDecember 2017, Dr. S determined that he was \u201cno longer in crisis\u201d and could return for \ntreatment as needed. (GX 3-4) \nHowever, Applicant continued to experience multiple difficulties at Company A. In \nMarch 2018, he was reprimanded for throwing a compact disc at another employee. He \ndenied throwing the disc. That same month, at the request of his wife, he resumed his \ntreatment with Dr. S. Medical records reflect that he was disinterested and distant and \nthat his thoughts were \u201cextreme and irrational.\u201d (GX 4) He told Dr. S that he thought about \nbecoming a biochemist so he could discover a way to stop pro-creation as people were \ndestroying the world. He testified that he made this statement at the time for its shock \nvalue and nothing more.

He \nadmitted this event and the inappropriateness of his behavior, but claimed he was only \ntrying to joke about another employee. (GX 1-4; Tr. 77-85) \nIn September 2018, Applicant was terminated from Company A following a \nconfrontation with a bank manager. He was seen later that day by Dr. S and it was noted \nthat he was depressed and had thoughts of suicide. He refused Dr. S\u2019s recommendation \nto check into the hospital, but ultimately agreed to stay with his parents for a few days in \norder to be monitored. Dr. S saw him again later that month and noted that he had \n\u201cregrouped after being fired\u201d and that he denied further suicidal ideation. (GX 4) With his \ntermination, Applicant lost his health insurance coverage. It was noted that he would \nreturn for further treatment with Dr. S or another provider once he was able to secure new \ninsurance. However, he never returned, nor did he begin treatment with a new provider. \nAt an unknown date after seeing Dr. S, Applicant also stopped taking medications for his \nmental health. (GX 1-4; Tr. 77-104) \nImmediately following his termination, Applicant repeatedly texted Ms. C, a fellow \nbank employee, even after she told him to stop. While cleaning out Applicant\u2019s desk after \nhis termination, bank officials also discovered a journal that he kept which included \nseveral disturbing writings. In it, Applicant wrote about loving Ms. C and about killing \nhimself or killing Ms. C\u2019s boyfriend. He also wrote about burning down the house where \nMs. C and her boyfriend lived. (GX 2-3; 85-93) \nUltimately, Ms. C filed a criminal complaint for harassment against Applicant. The \ncomplaint noted that Applicant had also sent letters to Ms. C\u2019s house expressing his love \nfor her which made her fearful as she had never given him her address. This complaint \nwas resolved through a pretrial diversion program and Applicant was ordered to not have \ncontact with Ms. C for one year. (GX 3; Tr. 90-102) \nWhen asked about Ms. C and the court proceedings, Applicant stated that he had \nbeen friends with Ms. C and nothing more. He described texting her after being terminated \nfrom Company A but stopped once she asked. Other than admitting to texting once after \nMs. C asked him to stop, he could not elaborate on how his texts could have led to a \ncriminal complaint. He described that the writings discovered in his desk were his therapy \njournal. He stated he could not recall having any feelings for Ms. C, sending letters to her \nhouse, having thoughts of suicide, or thoughts of doing harm to others during that period. \nHowever, he also stated that he was still in a recovery period and described not knowing \n\u201cup from down at that point.\u201d (Tr. 89) He described constantly feeling stressed while \nworking with the bank and described his \u201cagitation\u201d level as a 10 out of 10. (GX 2-3; Tr. 87-\n107)  \nAt the request of DOD, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist, \nDr. B in May 2022. Following a clinical interview, a personality assessment as well as a \nreview of available medical records and the DOD investigatory file, Dr. B noted that \nApplicant had a history of dissociative disorder and sociopathic tendencies.

This included his \nhistory of alcohol and drug use where he stated he had not consumed alcohol since high \nschool and last used marijuana and LSD in 2000. Comparably, Dr. S noted drug use \nthrough about 1995 and alcohol use through about 2008. (GX 3-4) \nApplicant also informed Dr. B about his termination from Company A, the bank, \nbut did not initially disclose the two prior reprimands he received at Company A, or the \njournal discovered in his desk that contained suicidal and homicidal thoughts. He \ndisclosed that a \u201crestraining order\u201d had been placed against him, but that it originated \nbecause he sent a single text to a female employee after she asked him to stop. Applicant \nalso stated that Dr. S told him to discontinue his mental health medications. While there \nis discussion in the medical record from Dr. S of the need for an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s \npsychotropic medications, the record is absent any statement from Dr. S that Applicant \nshould terminate his mental health medications. (GX 3-4; Tr. 87-93) \nDr. B found that Applicant lacked full candor or had poor insight. Dr. B also noted \nthat Applicant expressed little need for change in his behavior or for ongoing mental health \ntreatment. Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with bipolar I disorder and antisocial personality \ntraits as well as a history of alcohol and substance abuse. Dr. B opined that these \nconditions could impact Applicant\u2019s reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness, \nand impede his ability to safeguard classified information. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Dr. B concluded \nthat, without effective treatment, his severe symptoms of emotional distress could recur, \nand he may also be at risk of aggressive or impulsive behaviors. (GX 3) \nIn March 2023, Applicant obtained his own evaluation by Dr. J, a licensed clinical \npsychologist. Applicant provided Dr. J with his family history of bipolar disorder and that \nhe had not used any illegal drugs for over twenty years. He described being off of \nmedication for almost four years and had been without suicidal thoughts or any type of \ndisruptive behavior. He admitted that he still experienced \u201cmild mood swings,\u201d but had not \nexperienced \u201creal anger\u201d or \u201cirritability spikes\u201d and had used behavioral tools learned in \ncounseling and the support of his wife to \u201csee the queues\u201d of a potential problem. \nHowever, he did not provide Dr. J with any medical records or Dr. B\u2019s report. There is no \nindication in the report that he disclosed to Dr. J his employment issues in 2018 or the \nno-contact order that was placed against him. (AX C) \nFollowing a clinical interview and a personality inventory assessment, Dr. J \ndiagnosed Applicant with \u201cstatus-post history of bipolar disorder II, primarily depressed \nmood, residual.\u201d Dr. J opined that Applicant did not need any mental health medication \nor ongoing counseling. He found that Applicant was \u201cstable with good mood\u201d and had \n\u201cexcellent insight into his patterns of behavior and cycles of mood.\u201d Additionally, Dr. J \nnoted that Applicant had good support from his wife and maintained contact with his \nprimary care physician should any need for additional treatment arise in the future.

However, he admitted that he \noccasionally has thoughts of suicide, but described these thoughts as \u201cgetting a flash \u2026 \nand then it\u2019s gone\u201d and that he had no inclination to act on those thoughts. (Tr. 113) He \nbelieves he has learned the triggers that might lead to a mental health episode and used \nbehavioral tools that he learned from his treatment as well as people around him for \nstabilization and support. He does not believe he would benefit from further mental health \ntreatment. (Tr. 113-130, 150-158) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant described experiencing financial difficulties related to breaks in his \nemployment and that he had lacked experience in budgeting. He also testified to \npreviously experiencing manic episodes in which he would splurge on purchases that \nwould negatively impact his finances. He stated he had been generally unaware of the \nstatus of his accounts. Although he listed delinquent debts in his September 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA), he claimed to not have realized there was a problem with \nhis finances until, in February 2021, he attempted to secure a vehicle loan. In March 2021, \nhe formulated a budget with his wife and began to resolve some accounts. (Tr. 33-53; \n66-70) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a ($119) and 2.b ($959) are delinquent credit card accounts placed for \ncollection. Applicant disclosed these debts in his September 2020 SCA and provided \ndetails during his December 2020 background interview. A November 2020 credit report \nreflected a balance on the SOR \u00b6 2.a account as $3,361 and the SOR \u00b6 2.b account as \n$721. At an unrecalled time, Applicant initiated payments on the accounts. An October \n2022 credit report reflected that the SOR \u00b6 2.a account balance had reduced to $119, but \nthe SOR \u00b6 2.b debt had increased to $921. A February 2023 letter from a collection \nagency shows that the SOR \u00b6 2.a account was resolved in February 2023. A letter from \na collection agency shows that the SOR \u00b6 2.b account was resolved in March 2023. (GX \n1-2, 5-6; AX D-E, G; Tr. 19-35) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c ($11,688) is a credit card account that was charged off. Applicant did \nnot list this account in his September 2020 SCA as he later claimed he had forgotten \nabout it. However, during his background interview, he stated this was an account used \nto purchase appliances. The full balance was reflected as charged off in both his \nNovember 2020 and October 2022 credit reports. He testified that he had not initially \nissued payments or attempted to resolve the account as he was addressing other \naccounts first. In May 2023, the creditor issued a Cancellation of Debt (1099-C) and \nApplicant reported this in his relevant tax filings. (GX 2, 5-6; AX H; Tr. 34-47) \nApplicant\u2019s November 2020 credit report showed a foreclosure and an additional \ndelinquent debt ($775) not alleged in the SOR.

He is currently paying about $90 per month on that debt and provided a payment \nhistory through June 2024. (GX 5-6; AX F, G; Tr. 20-39) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report in the record, from February 2023, shows no \nnew delinquent accounts. Applicant testified that, when employed, he was able to \nmaintain a monthly budget and address his delinquent accounts. As he is currently \nunemployed, he is managing his expenditures with some reserve funds and his wife\u2019s \nincome and has not incurred further spending considered as splurges. (AX G; Tr. 35-39) \nApplicant submitted two reference letters in support of his character. Mr. B \nsupervised Applicant from 2021 through 2023 and described him as always being ready \nto help, eager to learn, and working in a positive manner. Ms. R worked with Applicant in \n2022 and 2023 and described him as dependable, forthright, and trustworthy. (AX A-B) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28 and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, \nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, \nchronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nApplicant was hospitalized in 2001 following a suicide attempt and he \nsubsequently denied further treatment. He was hospitalized again in 2016 following \nsuicidal ideation. When he and Dr. S agreed to terminate his regular treatment in \nDecember 2017, he again experienced further suicidal ideation and thoughts that were \ncharacterized as \u201cextreme and irrational.\u201d This necessitated the continuation of his \ntreatment. Immediately following his termination from Company A in September 2018, a \njournal was discovered at his desk in which he expressed both suicidal and homicidal \nthoughts. Based on the termination of his health insurance, he did not continue treatment \nwith Dr. S and never sought any additional treatment. \nIn a May 2022 evaluation, Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with bipolar I disorder and \nantisocial personality traits. Dr. B found that these conditions could impact Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness, and impede on his ability to safeguard \nclassified information. Additionally, Dr. B opined that, without effective treatment, his \nsevere symptoms of emotional distress could recur, and that he may also be at risk of \naggressive or impulsive behaviors. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDating back to at least 2001, Applicant has a long history of mental health \nconcerns, primarily relating to a bipolar I disorder. Following his suicide attempt in 2001, \nhe refused mental health treatment. While he avoided further hospitalizations over the \nnext fifteen years, he still admitted to experiencing mood swings and manic episodes. He \nalso experienced anger issues that led to his wife threatening to leave him and his \ntermination from a job in 2009 for throwing papers on a supervisor\u2019s desk. \nWith regard to his hospitalization in 2016, Applicant testified that he was unable to \nrecall, with any detail, what caused that mental health episode. Similarly, he could not \nrecall details regarding the journal discovered in his desk in September 2018 that \ncontained suicidal and homicidal ideations or his actions that led to the no-contact order \nin relation to Ms. C. As noted by Dr. B, Applicant appears reluctant to acknowledge the \nextent of his past actions and mental health episodes. It was Dr. B\u2019s assessment that \nApplicant required effective treatment so that his symptoms of emotional distress, and \nrisk of aggressive or impulsive behaviors would not return. \nContrarily, Dr. J opined that Applicant\u2019s condition was \u201cstatus-post history of bipolar \ndisorder II\u201d and that he was stable with good mood and excellent insight. However, while \nthat diagnostic impression was based on a clinical interview and personality \nassessments, Dr. J did not review Dr. S\u2019s medical records or Dr. B\u2019s psychological \nevaluation. Additionally, pertinent facts regarding Applicant\u2019s past behaviors are not \naddressed in Dr. J\u2019s evaluation. Dr. J did not address Applicant\u2019s \u201cextreme and irrational\u201d \nbehavior in 2018, after he initially terminated treatment with Dr. S. The evaluation also \ndid not address Applicant\u2019s termination from the bank in 2018, the suicidal and homicidal \nthoughts contained in Applicant\u2019s journal or the fact that a no-contact order was issued \nagainst Applicant. \nApplicant claims he is now \u201cvery in control\u201d of his mental health. However, he was \nunable to provide candid details of his past to both Dr. B and Dr. J and continued to show \nan inability to recall those details during his testimony. He has failed to demonstrate that \nhe has the awareness of his condition sufficient to establish that his mental health \nconcerns have resolved or no longer show indications of emotional instability. \nFurther, when weighing competing medical opinions, the judge is neither \ncompelled to accept a DOD-required psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of an applicant nor bound \nby any expert\u2019s testimony or report. Rather, the judge has to consider the record evidence \nas a whole in deciding what weight to give conflicting expert opinions. ISCR Case No. 19-\n00151 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019). In comparing Dr. B\u2019s and Dr. J\u2019s reports, I find that Dr. \nB\u2019s evaluation is more persuasive because it accurately reflects Applicant\u2019s diagnosis and \ncondition as it is based on information provided by the Applicant as well as medical and \nadditional records.   \nTherefore, while Applicant has fortunately not recently experienced suicidal \nideation or other severe symptoms of emotional distress as previously exhibited, he has \nnot met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising from his psychological \ncondition. None of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that he incurred multiple \ndelinquent accounts over the last several years. The above disqualifying conditions are \nestablished. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant experienced an extended period of financial difficulties. Some of these \ndifficulties related to periods of unemployment. However, in 2009 and again in 2018, \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment arose from him being fired from a job for cause. Further, he \ntestified that there were occasions when his manic episodes brought forth splurge \nspending and that he lacked experience in budgeting. \nNonetheless, in February 2021, following his inability to secure a vehicle loan, \nApplicant began to take action to address his debts. He and his wife formulated a budget \nand began to reach out to creditors to address delinquent accounts. In 2021, he resolved \none debt not alleged in the SOR. By October 2022, the SOR \u00b6 2.a debt had been reduced \nfrom $3,361 to $119 and was subsequently resolved. In March 2023, Applicant resolved \nthe SOR \u00b6 2.b debt. He is currently in a payment plan with an additional creditor for a \ndebt not alleged in the SOR. Applicant testified that he intended to resolve other debts \nprior to addressing the SOR \u00b6 2.c debt of $11,688. However, the creditor issued a 1099-C \nin May 2023 and is no longer pursuing the debt. Credit reports from 2023 show that \nApplicant has not obtained any new delinquent debt. \nWith the assistance of his wife and their budgeting efforts, Applicant has taken \naction to address his delinquent financial accounts. Even though he is currently \nunemployed, he and his wife are using her income and their reserve funds to maintain \ntheir monthly budget. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially applicable as several of the conditions \nthat resulted in Applicant\u2019s financial problems were within his control. However, mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) is fully applicable as Applicant has taken responsible action \nin addressing his debts and established a track record of payments.   \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline I and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s mental health and personal circumstances have improved since his \nhospitalization in 2016 and the events that led to his termination from Company A in \nSeptember 2018. He recognizes that he has a family history of bipolar disorder and has \nmade progress in managing his symptoms and relying on his support network as needed. \nThis includes working with his wife to maintain their financial budget and prevent splurge \nspending. While he admitted that he still has occasional thoughts of suicide, he described \nthese thoughts as flashes and said that he has managed them. \nDespite the benefits he received from his treatment with Dr. S, Applicant believes \nthat he is capable of controlling his symptoms without any further mental health treatment. \nHowever, his recognition of the severity of his past mental health events remains limited. \nTherefore, while he believes he is in control of his condition, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts about his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

Additional allegations covered by Guideline J \nare as follows: Applicant allegedly (b) received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 \nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in January 2021 based on his first \nfailed urinalysis test for wrongful use of a schedule II controlled substance; and (c) was \ncharged with a violation of the UCMJ, Article 121 (wrongful use of cocaine) in January \n2021 based on a second failed urinalysis, for which Applicant sought and received a \ndischarge under other than honorable conditions \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the allegations covered by \nGuidelines H and J with explanations. He claimed that he has recently undergone \nsubstance abuse counseling and evaluation and was diagnosed to be free of any drug \nabuse issues. He further claimed to be free of any addictions and motivated to remain \nstable and drug-free. He claimed, too, to have taken several on-line courses, inclusive \nof behavior and drug and alcohol awareness to bolster his knowledge about the \nnegative impacts that drugs can have and the importance of avoiding recurrences. \nApplicant also claimed the mitigating benefits of negative drug tests in 2021 and \n2022, a positive substance abuse diagnosis for alcohol and drug use (citing only a mild \nalcohol use disorder) and favorable prognosis, and statement of intent. pledging to \nabstain from use of illegal drugs in the future. \nAddressing his two positive drug tests of 2021, Applicant denied any intentional \ningestion of cocaine prior to testing positive for cocaine in 2021.

(GE 1; Tr. 66) He earned a high school diploma in May 2011 \nand completed aircraft leadership school classes. (GE 1 and AE G; Tr. 64) Applicant \nenlisted in the Air Force (AF) in October 2011 and served 10 years of active duty. (GE \n1; Tr. 66-67) During his AF career, Applicant excelled in his aircraft maintenance \nspecialty and earned numerous promotions. (AEs J-K) As a certified and experienced \naircraft crew chief and non-commissioned officer (NCO), he was recognized with \nnumerous designations and awards. (AEs E-F and J-K) \nIn June 2021, Applicant received a discharge from the Air Force under other than \nhonorable conditions, attributable to his testing positive for cocaine in two randomized \ndrug tests: one in December 2020 and the other in January 2021. (GEs 1-6; Tr. 66) In \nhis first administered randomized drug test in December 2020, he produced a confirmed \ncocaine level in his system of 772 ng/ml, well above the cutoff level of 100 ng/mL (GE 3) \nApplicant held a security clearance between June 2011 and March 2021. (GEs 1 and \n7). \nAfter testing positive for the second time in January 2021, Applicant was afforded \nan opportunity to provide a written reply to his AF commander\u2019s notification of his \nintended suspension of his security clearance. (GE 7) Without a written response from \nApplicant within the time permitted, Applicant\u2019s AF commander suspended Applicant\u2019s \naccess to classified information in March 2021. See GE 7 and Applicant\u2019s contrasting \nhearing statements. (Tr. 67, 112-113) \nPrior to testing positive for cocaine on December 4, 2020, Applicant and an AF \ncoworker friend repaired to a local `bar in England. (GE 2 and AE L; Tr. 71-72) Once in \nthe bar, Applicant consumed four to five beers and two to three shots within a two-hour \ntime span and became intoxicated (by both his own and friend\u2019s accounts). (GE 2 and \nAE L; Tr. 72) Seated at a nearby table was a group of local patrons who were watching \na soccer game and in a festive mood. (Tr. 72) Feeling tipsy himself from heavy drinking \nand smoking, he \u201cpurchased some shots for some of the patrons there.\u201d (Tr. 72) \nInebriated and in need of a cigarette, Applicant asked one of the local bar \npatrons for a cigarette. (GE 2 and AE L; Tr. 73-74) After asking the bar patron for a \ncigarette, one of the recipients of the shots he provided gave him three pre-rolled \ncigarettes that impressed Applicant at the time with being normal tobacco-laden \ncigarettes. (Tr. 73, 113-114) Although, from his AF friend\u2019s vantage, the three dispensed \ncigarettes he could see were \u201call white-looking joints/cigarettes\u201d on the table \u201cwith one \nbeing noticeably burnt at the end.\u201d (AE L) When his AF friend pointed out the burnt \ncigarette to him, he laughed off the comment with the remark that in England, Brits \ntypically roll their cigarettes. (AE L) \nAfter finishing the first cigarette he received from a member of the local bar \npatron group, Applicant returned to the bar (according to his friend\u2019s account) and asked \nthe group for another cigarette.

(AE L) \nWhat impressed the friend at this inflection moment was how sick Applicant \nlooked receiving the second cigarette and how the locals were laughing at Applicant as \nhe shuffled out of the bar. (AE L) Asked about the cigarette exchange at hearing, \nApplicant confirmed only that he was given three pre-rolled cigarettes without \nelaborating on the sequence of the cigarettes he received. (AE L; Tr. 73) Inebriation and \nmemory loss provide the best explanations for their slightly different sequential accounts \nof how and when the three pre-rolled cigarettes were furnished to Applicant. Overall, \nthough, the friend\u2019s account of events that transpired in the evening of December 2, \n2020 essentially corroborates Applicant\u2019s version furnished the OPM investigator in his \nAugust 2021 PSI. \nFrom the laughter emanating from the bar patrons that Applicant\u2019s friend \nwitnessed as Applicant exited the bar with a second self-rolled cigarette, they were \ncertain he was oblivious as to what he was about to smoke. And, while none of the \nfurnished cocaine-laced cigarettes alone could realistically be expected to produce a \n772-ng/mL confirmed reading in a positive drug test two days later (i.e., December 4, \n2020), two such cigarettes smoked sequentially within a short period of time could quite \npossibly produce such an outsized number when aggregated. \nApplicant\u2019s version of the events that transpired in the English bar essentially \ncovered the same sequence of events that his friend reported in his statement of \naccount. In Applicant\u2019s PSI, he told the OPM investigator that in early December 2020, \nwhile drinking with a co-worker in an English bar, he unknowingly smoked a single \ncocaine-laced cigarette from among the three cigarettes given to him by an unknown \npatron of the bar. (GE 2) According to Applicant\u2019s account, he smoked a single cigarette \noutside of the bar (implicitly leaving him with two other cigarettes) that did not make him \nfeel the effects of cocaine, possibly due to his heavy drinking at the time. (GE 2) \nPressed for more details by the interviewing OPM investigator, Applicant \nelaborated on his account and told the investigator about what his friend told him (i.e., \nthat he \u201clooked white and sic.\u201d). (GE 2) Applicant could not recall if he smoked another \ncigarette before leaving the bar. (GE 2) Several weeks later, according to Applicant\u2019s \naccount, he was snacking at home with another coworker and intoxicated from drinking \nwhen he realized he still had a cigarette left from the batch of three cigarettes given to \nhim earlier by the English bar patron. (GE 2) With this third cigarette, he went outside to \nsmoke it. \nConsidered together, the respective accounts of Applicant in his August 2021 \nPSI and his AF friend\u2019s account are reconcilable in most material respects. If left \nstanding alone unaffected by Applicant\u2019s contrasting and conflicting statement covering \nthe same December 2, 2020 bar events that he furnished earlier to his commanding \nofficer, his PSI account of the bar events quite possibly could have supported a \nfavorable credibility assessment of his claims of unknowing cocaine ingestion. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSeveral weeks after testing positive for cocaine in his first test (and before he \nlearned of the results of his first positive drug test), Applicant tested positive once again \nfor cocaine ingestion. (GEs 4 and 11) Summarized results of the Navy\u2019s lab testing of \nApplicant\u2019s furnished urine specimen following his second positive drug test produced \nan initial screening reading of 150 ng/mL and a confirming reading of 354 ng/mL (GEs 4 \nand 11) For reasons not fully explained by Applicant, he did not report the bar incident \nto AF investigators, who would have likely been positioned to investigate his bar \nencounter and hopefully verify his account. (Tr.101) \nAs the result of his first failed drug test, Applicant received non-judicial \npunishment (NJP) under Article 15 of the UCMJ for wrongful use of a Schedule II \ncontrolled substance. (GEs 5-6) In hopes of receiving a lighter punishment from his AF \ncommanding officer, Applicant penned a more appealing account of the incident that \ntrimmed the kind and number of cigarettes he received from the local bar patrons in the \nevening of December 2, 2020. (AE L) In his earlier January 14, 2021 memorandum \ncovering his account of the December 2, 2020 bar events (attached to his NJP record), \nhe assured his AF commander that while \u201calready buzzed from heavy drinking at home\u201d \nand from the five or six beers he consumed at the bar, he was inebriated and bought \nthe whole bar some 15 to 17 shots. (GE 7) \nElaborating further on his experiences in the English bar in his January 14, 2021 \nmemorandum to his commander, Applicant cited his feelings of wanting to smoke after \nso much drinking. Looking for someone in the bar with a cigarette to give, he \napproached a local bar group seated outside of the bar with a request \u201cto bum a \ncigarette.\u201d (GE 7) At this point (according to Applicant\u2019s earlier January 14 account), one \nof the bar patrons gave him a couple of normal cigarettes from a pack typically \npurchased in a store \u201cand a self-rolled cigarette\u201d to thank him \u201cfor the shot.\u201d (GE 7) \nAfter smoking the one self-rolled cigarette that did not smell like marijuana or \nanything illegal (according to Applicant in his memorandum), Applicant went back into \nthe bar, tipped the waitress, and left the bar with his friend. (GE 7) At no point in this \nearlier account did he acknowledge smoking a second or third self-rolled cigarette. (GE \n7) Aside from describing his bar experience, he stressed his NCO deployment awards \nand achievements and acknowledged responsibility for his poor decision-making. (GE \n7)   \nWith his acceptance of non-judicial punishment from his AF commander \n(augmented by a contrasting and conflicting version of the events of December 2, \n2020), Applicant avoided potentially more serious charges. (GE 7) Asked why he was \nnot more forthcoming about the events of December 2, 2020 in his January 14 \nmemorandum to his commanding officer, Applicant responded that he was trying to \nimpress his commanding officer with his sincerity and honesty (after pleading not guilty) \nand was less concerned about trying to remember the truthful details of the December 2 \nevents. (Tr. 107) Pressed further at hearing, Applicant placed his drunken status in the \nbar as his justification for not being more truthful about the events. (Tr. 107-108) For \nclarity purposes, he acknowledged that his January 14, 2021 account \u201csounded better,\u2019 \nand he was \u201cjust trying to save my career.\u201d (Tr. 114) \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing confirmation of his second failed urinalysis on January 20, 2021, \nApplicant was charged with violating Article 112a of the UCMJ (wrongful use of \ncocaine).

(GEs 8-9) Both of Applicant\u2019s \npositive drug tests occurred while he was granted access to classified information. (GEs \n1-5) And, in March 2021, Applicant\u2019s access to classified information was suspended. \n(GE 7) \nWhile Applicant never challenged his positive drug tests in a convened court \nmartial, or otherwise appealed the results of his drug tests, he has continued to deny his \nintentional ingestion of cocaine preceding his positive drug tests. (GE 2) Never feeling \nany adverse effects of cocaine ingestion, he has consistently claimed that he \nunknowingly accepted three cigarettes laced with cocaine from unknown sources in an \nEnglish bar. (GEs 2 and AE L) \nFor some historical background on cocaine use, urine testing is common for \nmonitoring cocaine users in drug treatment and parole programs. (GE 13) \nUnderstanding cocaine metabolism and excretion is essential for the interpretation of \ncocaine urine test results. Scholarly studies confirm that cocaine dissipates rather \nquickly and typically for smoked doses in the 20 to 40mg range and is detectable in \ndrug testing up to 80 hours after ingestion. (GE 13, at 7) \nFor smoked doses of cocaine in the 10 to 20ng.mL range, detection times \ntypically do not run past a day. (id.) Published detection windows for cocaine ingestion \nat or below DoD screening and confirming targets typically run no longer than three \ndays. (GE 11) Tested subjects ingested with cocaine in the 200 ng/mL range show \ntraces of cocaine in their system for up to 480 minutes (or 80 hours). (GE 12, at 35) \nAfter the test results were returned days later with a positive reading for cocaine, \nApplicant was referred to his unit\u2019s office of special investigations for another \nrandomized drug test. (GE 2) Like his first test, this follow-up randomized drug test \nreturned positive test results as well for cocaine. \nUnder questioning at hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he likely smoked two \ncocaine-laced cigarettes of the three given to him by the patrons of the English bar he \nand his friend visited in December 2020. (Tr. 105, 113) His revised PSI and hearing \naccounts both reconcile with his AF friend\u2019s version of the events that transpired at the \nEnglish bar. Both accounts contrast and conflict with Applicant\u2019s January 14, 2021 \nmemorandum version of events. \nWeighing the respective accounts of Applicant that he disclosed to the OPM \nagent who interviewed him in August 2021 and his friend\u2019s account of the events in the \nEnglish bar in the evening of December 2, 2020, Applicant\u2019s claims of receiving three \ncocaine-free cigarettes sequentially from a local patron of the bar they visited are \nreconcilable and, unless otherwise challenged, are worthy of a favorable credibility \nassessment.

Applicant\u2019s offered proofs of innocence of \nany knowing use of cocaine in 2020 and 2021, respectively, are insufficient based on a \ncareful reading of all of the evidence produced in the record to clear him of any imputed \nknowledge of his pre-testing use of cocaine-laced cigarettes on not just one, but two \nseparate occasions. \nLooking forward to a drug-free future, Applicant has abstained from any use or \ninvolvement with illegal drugs since his second positive drug test in January 2021. To \nreinforce his commitment to future avoidance of illegal drugs, he has taken several on-\nline courses, inclusive of behavior and drug and alcohol awareness classes, to bolster \nhis knowledge about the negative impacts that drugs can have and the importance of \navoiding recurrences. (AEs O-P) Additionally, he completed two favorable randomized \nnegative drug tests in 2021 and 2022, respectively, through his current employer, \nreceived a positive substance abuse diagnosis for alcohol and drug use (citing only a \nmild alcohol use disorder) and favorable prognosis, and documented his personal \npledge to abstain from use of illegal drugs in the future. (AEs M, N, and Q) \nEndorsements \nApplicant\u2019s AF chain of command and current supervisors and coworkers hold \nApplicant in high esteem and confidence.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n      \n \n \n \nDrug Involvement \n           The Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because  such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

AG \u00b6 30. \n Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Applicable DCs are DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(b) \u201ctesting \npositive for an illegal drug\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access \nto classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \n \n \n \nApplicable federal law on the use of controlled substances \nUnder federal law, to prove a violation of the Controlled Substance Act (21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 829(a)), the Government must establish an applicant\u2019s \u201cknowing and \nintentional\u201d violation of the Act. (CSA) While proof standards for demonstrating \nknowledge and intention to use cocaine-laced products in DOHA proceedings are not \ntotally limited to an applicant\u2019s subjective personal account, they do require \nconsideration of circumstances surrounding the individual\u2019s use of the product that take \ninto account the person\u2019s experience with the product (if any), visible signs or scents \nthat the product might contain a controlled substance, the reliability of the source, \ninconsistent accounts of events where the controlled substance (cocaine in this case) \nwas obtained, and other indicators that could be expected to arouse the person\u2019s \nsuspicions. See ISCR Case No. 22-01176 at 5, n. 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 2023)  \nWhile use of a reasonable, good-faith belief standard (a recognized civil standard \nof proof) might be used as an aid in evaluating an applicant\u2019s claimed unknowing and \nunintended use of a banned product like cocaine, it may not be used as a substitute for \na subjective intent test that takes account of the applicant\u2019s personal claims of \ninnocence, the quality and consistency of his claims and explanations, and the \nsurrounding circumstances in making an overall credibility assessment.

This requirement holds for not only \ncriminal and civil court cases, but ISCR cases as well where all that is required to meet \nthe Government\u2019s initial burden is the making of a prima facie case. See Ruan v. United \nStates, 142 Sup. Ct. 2370, 2378 (2023) Plausible explanations for Applicant\u2019s positive \ndrug test results for cocaine in January 2021 are quite limited based on the evidence in \nthe record. What is at issue is the state of Applicant\u2019s knowledge and intentions when \nhe accepted three self-rolled cigarettes from strangers in an English bar in December \n2020. \nApplication of a blended subjective intent standard in Applicant\u2019s case in making \na credibility assessment of his innocence still requires consideration of all of the \nsurrounding circumstances before assigning any inferred acceptance of his \ncorroborated PSI account of his unknowing receipt of three cocaine-laced cigarettes \nfrom strangers in a local bar in December 2020. Because his PSI account provides a \nfactual narrative that contradicts key facts told to his AF commander pertaining to the \ncigarettes given to hm by bar patrons in the evening of December 2020, his whole story \nbecomes subject to credibility challenges. Without reconciliation of his August 2021 PSI \naccount with the earlier account he provided his AF commander in January 2021, his \nclaims and explanations of innocent ingestion of cocaine become open to meritorious \nchallenges from the Government. \nConsidering all of Applicant\u2019s claims and explanations of innocent ingestion of \ncocaine, his claims of not knowing or intending to smoke cocaine-laced cigarettes given \nto him by a stranger in an English bar cannot be accepted and incorporated without \neither a reconciled overall credible account from Applicant, or alternatively from \nfavorable credibility accounts drawn from an administrative record from any AF \nproceeding convened to consider Applicant\u2019s claims of innocence. From the evidence \nproduced in this record, Applicant\u2019s tested credibility cannot be accepted as an overall \ntruthful accounting of the events that transpired in the English bar in the evening of \nDecember 2, 2020. Applicant\u2019s claimed innocence of knowing and intentional ingestion \nof a banned controlled substance (cocaine) is not established. \nMitigating credit is not available to Applicant. His insufficiently explained positive \ndrug tests are still too recent to entitle him to findings that he is absolved of any risks of \nrecurrence. Despite an otherwise unblemished record of abstinence from illegal drug \nuse and a rich glossary of reassurances of reliability and trustworthiness from his AF \nand civilian supervisors and colleagues, it still remains too soon to make safe \npredictions of his ability to avoid misuse of illegal drugs when opportunities present \n11 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n            \n          \n \n \n   \n                     \n                                    \n \n \n \nthemselves in social situations.

Additional security concerns are raised over the \nresulting punishment received from his AF command after twice testing positive for \ncocaine. Applicable DCs covered by Guideline J are: DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, \nbut not limited to a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted\u201d and 31(e), \u201cdischarge or dismissal from the Armed forces for \nreasons other than \u201chonorable.\u201d By treating Applicant\u2019s positive tests of cocaine to be \nboth recent and subject to risks of recurrence, none of the potentially available \nmitigating conditions can be applied to applicant\u2019s situation. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his positive drug tests while holding a security clearance and \nresulting discharge under other than honorable conditions is fully compatible with \nminimum standards for holding a security clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s \ncredited military and civilian defense contributions and his unblemished record of drug \navoidance (both before and after his positive 2020 and 2021 drug tests) and the strong \ncharacter references, performance evaluations, and decorations and awards he has \nreceived while in the Air Force and in his current civilian employment, he is credited with \nmaking an encouraging showing of good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Still, \nthe Government\u2019s drug and criminal conduct concerns in this case are too strong to \nsafely overcome without more time of avoidance of illegal substances than the two-plus \nyears credited to him to satisfy minimum requirements of trust, reliability, and judgment \nfor holding a security clearance. \n I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 6, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations guideline the \nDCSA CAS could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for \ngranting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense \n(DoD) Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 21, 2022, and requested that his \ncase be resolved on the written record without a hearing.

Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts have not been resolved and remain outstanding. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted most of the alleged student loan \ndebts (leaving blank the allegations of SOR \u00b6 1.a) with explanations.

He admitted the medical debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.q, \nand 1.r-1.s, and claimed he will pay these debts if he cannot resolve his disputes with \nhis insurance company.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts \nthat raise trust, reliability, and judgment concerns about his current and future ability to \nmanage his finances safely and responsibly. These concerns are addressed below. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated delinquent dets warrant the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines.

His admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented \nand create judgment issues over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. \n03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nWithout any documented evidence of Applicant\u2019s \nresolving his \ndebt \ndelinquencies with payoffs and payment plans or good cause demonstrated for why \nthese debts have not been resolved, none of the potentially available mitigating \nconditions are available to Applicant. In the past, the Appeal Board has consistently \nimposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to provide documentation corroborating \nactions taken to resolve financial problems, whether the issues relate to back taxes or \nother debts and accounts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, \n2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s expressed commitments (both in his SOR response and PSI) to \naddress his still outstanding accounts with promised payments, while encouraging, \nrepresent no more than promises to resolve his still outstanding debts and are not \nviable substitutes for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise \nacting in a responsible way. See ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, \n2019); ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) Promises to pay or \notherwise resolve delinquent debts in the future have never been considered by the \nAppeal Board to be good substitutes for a meaningful track record of paying debts in a \nfinancially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nAnd, debts remain relevant for security clearance purposes even if they are no longer \nenforceable due to the running of a state\u2019s statute of limitations. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01208 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of accumulated delinquent accounts is fully \ncompatible with minimum standards for holding a security clearance. While Applicant is \nentitled to credit for his work in the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this \ntime to overcome his repeated failures or inability to address his debts in a timely way. \nOverall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n  \n                                                        \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for him to establish the requisite levels of \nstability with his finances to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security \nclearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

(GE 1-2; Tr. 11-13, 15-16, 31-32, 34-37) \nThe SOR alleged 11 delinquent debts, including four judgments, totaling $75,885. \nApplicant admitted all the allegations, except SOR \u00b6 1.k ($557). These debts appear in \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBRs). (Answer; GE 2-8) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR were opened between 2015 and 2020 and became \ndelinquent between 2018 and 2022. All but one of the alleged debts are credit cards, \npersonal-bank loans, or a line of credit. Applicant testified he had not made any payments \ntoward the alleged debts, nor has he contacted his creditors. However, he intends to \nresolve them in the future when he has more income and the ability to make payments. \nAt the time of the hearing, his mortgage of approximately $280,000 was in forbearance, \nand his last full payment was made in April 2021. Additionally, he testified he has new \nunalleged delinquent debts, including a $2,000 credit card he opened in December 2022 \nthat is approximately four to five months past due. He is also a month behind on his two \ncar leases. These debts were not alleged in the SOR, and they are not considered as \ndisqualifying; however, they may be considered in determining the applicability of \nmitigating conditions and in my whole person analysis.

(Answer; \nGE 1-2, 8; Tr. 36, 50) \nAs noted above, Applicant has been unemployed since June 2019. He has been \nunable to find positions with government contractors and civilian employers. He testified \nthat after leaving his last employment in 2019, he received unemployment benefits of \n$350 for 14 weeks. He previously disclosed he received unemployment benefits of $650 \nweekly or $2,600 monthly. Starting in 2020, he received COVID-19 benefits for \napproximately one year. His wife received unemployment benefits of $320 weekly or \n$1,280 monthly starting in March 2021. She started working in September 2022 earning \napproximately $1,500 net monthly. His oldest son left college early, and he provides \nfinancial support to their family. Since July 2023, he has received $1,511 monthly in Social \nSecurity disability due to an injury he received in Africa (he received Social Security \nbenefits of $1,100 monthly from June 2022 to July 2023). One of his brothers also \nprovides him with financial support. Applicant owes him approximately $27,000, and he \nhas not made any payments to his brother. He also borrowed $1,500 from a cousin and \nused part of his 2022 income tax refund of $5,000 to repay him. The unalleged personal \nloans from family members are not alleged in the SOR, and they are not considered as \ndisqualifying; however, they may be considered in determining the applicability of \nmitigating conditions and in my whole person analysis. (GE 8; Tr. 24-33, 69, 76) \nApplicant does not follow a written budget. At the time of the hearing, he had $482 \nin his savings account, no money in his checking account, and no money in a retirement \nsavings account. In 2021, he leased a brand-new vehicle with a $465 monthly payment, \nand in 2022, he leased a brand-new vehicle with a $306 monthly payment. He was aware \nof his financial issues when he leased both vehicles. In 2010, during a previous \ninvestigation, he had $18,000 in delinquent debt, and he resolved it through a \nconsolidation firm. (Tr. 77, 79-82, 85) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he included a personal statement and a letter \nof recommendation regarding the circumstances related to his leaving his former \nemployer in June 2019 by mutual agreement. Applicant asserted and was supported by \nthe letter of recommendation, that he was discriminated against by his supervisor, and it \naffected his employment.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are current, ongoing, and substantial. None of the \nalleged debts have been resolved, nor has he established payment arrangements or \ncontacted his creditors in many years. He also has limited financial resources to make \nmonthly payments. He has additional unalleged personal loans from his brother totaling \napproximately $27,000, a new delinquent credit card debt of $2,000, has not made a full \nmortgage payment since the spring of 2021, and is having difficulty making timely \npayments toward his leased vehicles. He leased these brand-new vehicles in 2021 and \n2022, despite having financial problems concurrent with the leases. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s history of unemployment and medical issues as \ncontributing factors to his financial problems. However, he failed to provide evidence that \nhe has acted responsibly during the past four years to resolve his delinquent debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInstead, he made choices, such as leasing brand-new vehicles, which only contributed to \nhis monthly financial obligations. \nOverall, Applicant has not demonstrated he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to address and resolve, or attempt to resolve, his delinquent debts in a \ntimely manner. Nor has he made a good-faith effort to repay his creditors, and he has \nonly increased his debt in the last few years. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and \n20(d) was not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant failed to resolve his delinquent debts. Overall, he has not \ndemonstrated the actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy person. I conclude \nhe did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

The \noffenses that are misdemeanors are: driving while revoked; violation of registration \nprovisions; reckless driving; and operations of vehicle without financial responsibility.

Applicant admitted he did not have insurance. He had no excuse \nand was aware of it at the time, but he needed to drive. The tags for his car were expired \nor canceled. He provided a letter from his attorney that confirmed he pleaded guilty to \nimproper equipment and the paid court costs and a fine. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Tr. 29-30; AE C) \nPersonal Conduct Allegations \nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducted an investigation regarding \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose on numerous official government documents that he had \nbeen terminated from a job due to absenteeism. The investigation found that Applicant \nintentionally provided false information about his employment. A copy of the notice of \ndisciplinary action and termination letter he received from his employer for excessive \nabsenteeism shows he signed it and dated the letter in July 2017. Applicant denied he \nintentionally falsified the government documents. The SOR alleged the specific \ndocuments were a June 2018 resume, a July 2018 Optional Form 306, a September 2018 \nOptional Form 306, a September 2018 security clearance application (SCA) and a \nNovember 2018 SCA. I was provided a copy of the November 2018 SCA and the \nSeptember 2018 Optional Form 306. I was not provided copies of the other documents \nalleged in the SOR. My findings are based only on the two documents provided. The \ndocuments show he did not disclose on these documents that he was terminated from \nhis employment.

(Tr. 18-19, 75-76; AE B, H) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has a long history of criminal conduct beginning in 2004 and continuing \nto May 2022. In 2004, he failed to return a key he was entrusted with when he worked at \nMcDonald\u2019s and broke into the store at night and stole $1,200. In 2005, he pleaded guilty \nto assaulting the mother of one of his daughters. He has been charged and found guilty \ntwice for failing to appear in court as ordered. Three times he has been found guilty of \nprobation violations, including once for intentionally failing to attend an anger \nmanagement class, where he was ordered to serve 50 days in jail. Applicant also has \nbeen charged with misdemeanor offenses involving the operation of his vehicle without \ninsurance, reckless driving-wanton disregard (speeding), fictitious/altered title/registration \ncard, and driving with a revoked license. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has a long history of violating the law. I have considered that some of \nthe charges were minor motor vehicle or traffic violations, but others were charged as \nmisdemeanors. He was convicted of larceny when he violated the trust of his former \nemployer by using a key to gain access and steal money. He has shown an obvious \ndisregard for complying with the law. His conduct has occurred over the past 18 years \nwith his latest offense occurring in 2022. He failed to comply with court orders, probation \nterms, and traffic laws to protect the safety of others. Based on his extensive criminal \nconduct, I am unable to conclude future misconduct is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I have \nconsidered his character evidence. Despite some evidence of rehabilitation, it is \ninsufficient to mitigate his history of criminal conduct. The above mitigating conditions do \nnot apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

Such conduct includes:  \n(1) engaging in activities which if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose he was terminated from employment on \nhis November 2018 SCA and September 2018 Optional Form 306. Applicant was \ncharged with misdemeanors and received citations from 2004 through 2020 that include \nspeeding (ten times), improper equipment, no operator\u2019s license, driving no/expired \nlicense, and expired registration/car/tag expired/no inspection. Applicant\u2019s disregard for \ncomplying with the motor vehicle and safety rules raises questions about his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a), 16(d) and 16(e) apply. \nApplicant\u2019s Guideline J, criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m) was cross-\nalleged under the personal conduct guideline in SOR \u00b6 2.r. His conduct reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also \ncreates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an \nadverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline. However, the general \nconcerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications on government documents are not minor. The sheer \nnumber of charges under criminal and motor vehicle laws since 2004 raises questions \nabout his willingness to comply with rules and regulations. He repeatedly committed some \nof the same offenses and was aware his conduct was in violation of the law and not just \ndue to negligence. The evidence is insufficient to conclude future similar conduct is \nunlikely to recur. Failing to be honest and disclose his past employment termination is not \nminor. The security clearance process relies on those entrusted with the nations secrets \nto be forthcoming and comply with its laws and rules. Applicant failed to do so. His long \nhistory of disregarding laws and rules casts doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has seven delinquent debts totaling approximately $28,719 that began \naccumulating in 2009. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant addressed two small debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.g) after he received the \nSOR. I have considered that he has paid or is paying these debts, but his failure to do so \nuntil after he received the SOR does not constitute a good-faith effort. He has not \naddressed the remaining delinquent debts. He says he cannot afford to pay the debts. \nAlthough, he said he had financial issues when he and the mother of his daughter \nseparated, some of these debts were incurred in 2009 and 2010.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, E and F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered his positive \ncharacter letters. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion.

He took some time off in 2010 to purchase a $90,000 home. He lived there \nwhen he returned to school to obtain his degree and he intended to later use it as an \ninvestment property. He made his first payment towards his student loans before \ngraduation. In approximately 2012 or 2013, he began experiencing financial problems \nwhen he faced discrimination at his restaurant job after certain managers cut his hours, \nassigned him to bad sections, and did \u201cthings that would hinder me making money . . . .\u201d \nHis pay decreased by approximately 30% and he fell behind on his mortgage.

When his student loans became due in May 2014, \nhe was unable to pay them despite obtaining deferments for three-to-six-month periods \non several occasions in 2014 and 2015. From the summer of 2014 to April 2015, as \npreviously discussed, he was underemployed, and he incurred approximately $4,000 in \nself-employment-related expenses for his cleaning service. In around 2014 or 2015, the \nmortgage creditor thought he abandoned his home. It went into foreclosure in 2017 or \n2018 and he did not owe a deficiency balance. (Tr. at 14-15, 22-44, 56-58; GE 1-4, 6-10) \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished in the amount of $1,000 monthly by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (DoE) from October 2019 to March 2020 for his student loans. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j) In the summer of 2022, he completed documentation in an attempt to \nset up an income-based repayment plan with the DoE, and he made two payments to the \nDoE of $150 each in December 2022. He did not receive a response. He understood that \nhe did not have to pay his student loans during the COVID-19 payment pause. In July \n2023, he agreed to long-term payment arrangements with the DoE, his student loans \nwere transferred to a new loan servicer, and they were no longer in default status. The \nmost recent credit bureau report from July 2023 reflects that while these student loans \ncontinue to have outstanding balances, they were no longer reported as delinquent, and \nthey were scheduled to go to a positive status by December 2024. (Tr. at 44-49, 65-67; \nGE 1-4, 9-10; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a $2,576 judgment entered against Applicant by a property \nmanagement company in 2019. He contracted with the company in 2017 for a term of \none or two years to obtain renters for his home. The company found renters for a six-\nmonth period and then he elected to \u201cjust get the house back to the mortgage.\u201d He did \nnot believe he owed the company, and he was unaware of the judgment until he received \nthe SOR. He then immediately telephoned the company to inquire about the judgment, \nbut he was not given an explanation. In late 2022, the court that issued the judgment \ngarnished his wages for $3,100. Court records reflect that Applicant satisfied this \njudgment in March 2023. (Tr. at 49-55, 67-70, 72-73; GE 1-2, 5, 11) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m are for judgments entered against Applicant by a city \ntreasurer\u2019s office in the amounts of $59 and $224, in 2012 and 2014, respectively, for \nproperty taxes related to his home. These debts are established by court records, and \nthey are not reported on any of the credit reports. Applicant stated that he paid these \ndebts. (Tr. at 55-56; GE 5) \nApplicant filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016, 2017, and 2018 in 2021, \nand he owed $820, $750, and $385 respectively, which he paid when he filed. He believed \nhe filed his state income tax returns for those tax years at the same as his federal income \ntax returns, but he acknowledged that he had not yet done so as of the date of the hearing. \nHe did not believe he owed any state taxes for those tax years. In July 2023, he stated \nthat he filed these state income tax returns in person with the state tax authority.

(Tr. at \n33, 35, 38-42, 59-64, 69-72; GE 1-4, 10; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. He also failed to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 to 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c), 19(c), and \n19(f) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file \nor pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. \nNonetheless, under AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder his circumstances. He filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016, 2017, and \n2018, and paid the associated taxes, in 2021, before the SOR. Also, before the SOR, in \nthe summer of 2022, he attempted to set up an income-based repayment plan with the \nU.S. DoE for his student loans, and he made two payments totaling $300 toward his \nstudent loans in December 2022. After the COVID-19 payment pause was lifted, he \nagreed to long-term payment arrangements with the DoE in July 2023, his student loans \nwere transferred to a new loan servicer, and they were no longer in default status. He has \nthe financial means to make monthly payments on his student loans. Upon receiving the \nSOR and learning about the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.k, he resolved it in March 2023. He \nstated that he filed his state income tax returns for TY 2016 through 2018 in person with \nthe state tax authority in July 2023, and that he paid the smaller judgments in SOR \u00b6 1.l \nand 1.m. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit bureau report from 2023 reflects only one minor \ndelinquent debt. While he has not received financial counseling, he is utilizing a credit \nrepair company and a credit monitoring service to maintain control over his finances. He \nhas the financial means to continue to maintain control over his finances. I find that his \nfinancial issues do not continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply but AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old aircraft servicer employed by a federal contractor since \nAugust 2019. He has never held a security clearance. He has never married. He has a \nthree-year-old son for whom he pays child support. \nApplicant graduated from high school in July 2011. He attended college from \nAugust 2011 to December 2015, when he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. He received \nstudent financial aid while in college. He worked part time as a self-employed party \npromoter from August 2011 to August 2019, selling tickets to parties and social events for \na profit. He also worked for a beverage company from July 2011 to September 2017. He \nworked for a collection agency from October 2017 to January 2018, but he quit because \nhe did not like the work, and he was unemployed until he was hired for his current position. \nHe testified that many of his debts were incurred when he was going to college and trying \nto support himself. (Tr. 13) He incurred student loans while in college, but he has not \nstarted making payments on them. (Tr. 16) The SOR does not allege any delinquent \nstudent loans. \nIn May 2018, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. \nHe and two passengers were in his vehicle, and the two passengers were smoking \nmarijuana. Disposition of the charges was deferred, and Applicant was required to attend \na substance-abuse class, pay a fine of $286, and perform 24 hours of community service. \nAfter he completed these requirements, the charges were dismissed. (GX 2 at 4; GX 3) \nHe testified that he started smoking marijuana \u201cevery couple days\u201d while he was \nunemployed. (Tr. 44). He stopped using marijuana after the May 2018 incident. (Tr. 47) \nHis drug involvement is alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a. \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts reflected in credit reports dated February 16, \n2022 (GX 5); April 15, 2021 (GX 6); and January 4, 2024 (GX 7). The evidence concerning \nthese debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a default judgment entered in December 2020 for unpaid \nproperty taxes on a motor vehicle in the amount $421. (GX 4 at 1) In Applicant\u2019s answer \nto the SOR, he admitted this debt and stated that he had contacted the tax authority to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nestablish a payment plan. At the hearing, he testified that he did not know anything about \nthis debt. (Tr. 20-21) The judgment has not been satisfied. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a judgment entered against Applicant in March 2019 for $3,680. \nCourt records reflect that the judgment was for unpaid rent. (GX 4 at 3) At the hearing, \nApplicant testified that his apartment had flooded and damaged his personal property, and \nhis landlord promised to reimburse him for the damages but did not keep his promise. \nApplicant testified that he stopped paying rent and was evicted after one month of \nnonpayment. (Tr. 23) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in November \n2019, he said that he moved out when he received an eviction notice. He told the \ninvestigator that he did not intend to pay judgment. (GX 2 at 6) However, the court records \nreflect that the judgment was satisfied by garnishment in February 2021. (GX 4 at 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges an account charged-off for $14,167. The delinquent amount is \nthe deficiency after a vehicle was repossessed and sold. (GX 5 at 3) Applicant told a \nsecurity investigator that the debt is valid, but that he did not intend to pay it because he \ncould not afford to. (GX 2 at 6) As of the date of the hearing, he had taken no action to \nresolve it. (Tr. 25). \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a credit-card account charged off for $3,505. Applicant told a \nsecurity investigator that the creditor offered to settle this debt for $1,400, but he did not \nintend to pay it. (GX 4 at 7) As of the date of the hearing, he had taken no action to resolve \nit. (Tr. 25) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges an account charged off for $1,882. Applicant told a security \ninvestigator that this debt was the deficiency after a vehicle repossession that preceded \nthe repossession on which the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was based. He told the \ninvestigator that he did not intend to pay it. (GX 4 at 7) At the hearing, he testified that he \nbelieved the debt was a personal loan. (Tr. 25) It is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a medical debt placed for collection of $369. Applicant told a \nsecurity investigator that he does not intend to pay it. (GX 4 at 6) At the hearing, he testified \nthat he had numerous unpaid medical debts, but he was unable to specifically identify this \ndebt. (Tr. 25, 34) It is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a utility bill placed for collection of $227. He told a security \ninvestigator that he would contact the creditor and resolve it. (GX 4 at 6) At the hearing, \nhe testified that he had lived in multiple apartments, and he could not determine which \nunpaid utility bill was alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 26) It is unresolved. \nApplicant currently earns about $28 per hour, and his take-home pay for each two-\nweek pay period is about $1,500. (Tr. 19) He testified that he was behind on his rent \npayments and his car payments at the time of the hearing. (Tr. 26-27) For the past two \nyears, he has been paying $720 per month for his child\u2019s daycare. In November 2023, he \nwas ordered to pay child support of $846 per month, plus $100 per month to include his \nchild in his medical insurance.

He has not disputed any of the debts. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially overextended is at \ngreater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the evidence submitted at the hearing, and his declarations \nto a security investigator that he does not intend to resolve several of his debts establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s loss of property due to flooding was a \ncondition largely beyond his control. Some of his medical expenses may have been due \nto unexpected injuries and illnesses and largely beyond his control, but he did not identify \nany medical debts that were incurred due to unexpected medical emergencies. \nFurthermore, he has not acted responsibly. He does not pay attention to his financial \nsituation. He does not regularly monitor his mail. He told a security investigator that he did \nnot intend to pay his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is the only debt \nthat has been satisfied. However, payment by involuntary garnishment is not a good-faith \neffort to resolve a debt. ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the\nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence . . . . \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has acknowledged his \nprevious marijuana use, and he stopped using marijuana after the incident in May 2018. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls \ninto question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s admission that he used marijuana in May 2018 establishes these \ntwo disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has not possessed or used \nmarijuana since May 2018. His drug involvement is mitigated by the passage of time \nwithout recurrence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, H, and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid and \nsincere at the hearing, but his approach to his financial problems has been passive and \nreactive. He submitted no evidence of positive steps to gain control of his financial \nsituation. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, H, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement and criminal \nconduct, but he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drug Involvement) \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The first \ntime, he smoked it in a bong pipe, shared with friends, and the second time, he ingested it \nin edible form.(Item 4 at 4) Applicant had a security clearance when he used marijuana. \nBefore using the marijuana, he had spoken with other people with security clearances who \nused marijuana and they advised him that it was not a big deal. (Item 4 at 5) Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use occurred while granted access to classified information. (Item 2 at 1) \nApplicant attributes peer pressure for his decision to smoke marijuana. Specifically, \nhis then-roommate pressured him constantly to use it. (Item 2 at 1) Applicant has not used \nmarijuana since the April 2020 episode. In December 2022, he moved out of the apartment \nthat he shared with the marijuana-smoking roommate and executed an affidavit expressing \nhis intent never to use marijuana again. (Item 2 at 2) \nApplicant falsified a security clearance application, completed in 2021, when he \nfailed to disclose his marijuana use and the fact that he used marijuana while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. (Item 2 at 1) In his SOR answer, he contends that he did not disclose \nthe marijuana use on his application because he did not remember the instances when he \nused it. (Item 1 at 2) During an investigative interview in January 2022, he told the \ninvestigative agent that he did not disclose the marijuana on the security clearance \napplication because he thought he was only required to disclose hard drugs like heroin or \ncocaine. (Item 4 at 4) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \n(Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose marijuana use on his 2021 security clearance \napplication raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. Applicant\u2019s explanation for \nomitting his marijuana use on the security clearance application that he told the \ninvestigative agent during an interview contradicted the explanation he provided in \nresponse to the SOR. These conflicting responses fundamentally undercut his credibility. \nConsequently, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation. Applicant failed to \nmitigate the Guideline E security concern. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nUnder this guideline, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse \nof prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 24) Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while granted access to classified \ninformation triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(f), \n\u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition.\u201d \nApplicant now acknowledges his marijuana use. Further, he moved from the \napartment that he shared with an individual who constantly pressured him to use \nmarijuana. Having relocated from the source of his peer pressure, the mitigating conditions \nset forth in AG \u00b6 26(b)(1),\u201d disassociation from drug using associates and contacts,\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201c changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used,\u201d apply. \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use in the \nfuture, understanding that future use would be grounds for the revocation of his national \nsecurity eligibility. (See AG \u00b6 b(3)) Given Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance \napplication, his reassurance that his use will not recur has minimal probative value. In sum, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI considered the whole-person concept in my application of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions of the guidelines, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Tr. 17-18; GE 1) \nIn April 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). Section \n21 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, asked in the last seven years if Applicant had \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances. As part of the instructions for \ncompleting this section, it stated: \nAs to this particular section, this applies whether or not you are currently \nemployed by the Federal government.

He was stopped by the police and a small \namount of marijuana was found in his car. He disclosed it did not belong to him.

When he was stopped by the police, he had forgotten the marijuana was in \nthe car. He gave the police permission to search his car and they found less than two \ngrams of marijuana. Applicant was arrested, posted bond, and went to court. He told the \ninvestigator he received 10 hours of community service, and the charge was dropped \nafter he completed it. (GE 3) \nIn March 2022, Applicant completed another SCA. In response to Section 23, \nwhich asked if in the last seven years if Applicant had illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances. He responded \u201cNo.\u201d The same instructions were included regarding \ndisclosing illegal use of drugs regardless if their use was legal under state law. Under the \nsection regarding disclosing if he had ever been arrested, he included his July 2019 arrest \nfor marijuana possession and the same explanation. (GE 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2022. He told the \ninvestigator that when he was arrested for possession of marijuana that was found in his \ncar, it belonged to his friend. He did not want his drugs in his house. When he was stopped \nby the police, he was unaware that his friend had not retrieved his marijuana when it was \ndiscovered by the police. He told the investigator that after his arrest, he posted bond and \nreceived a court date. He said the judge gave him 10 hours of community service and the \ncharges were dropped after he completed them. He told the investigator that he forgot his \nfriend left marijuana in his car. He said he does not associate with people who use drugs, \nand he has no future intention to do so. (GE 3) \nDuring the May 2022 interview, Applicant was asked by the government \ninvestigator for more information about his 2019 marijuana possession arrest. Applicant \nexplained that the police told him that they smelled marijuana in the vehicle and had \nprobable cause to search it. Applicant said he did not smoke it and it did not belong to \nhim. He was asked by the government investigator if he had used marijuana in the last \nseven years. He said he had used marijuana in the last seven years but had not used it \nin the past three years. He said he was not a frequent user, and he was not addicted to \nit. He used it when he was with friends who were using it and it was given to him by his \nfriends. He used it out of curiosity and to fit in when he was with others. He first tried \nmarijuana when he was in college and used it infrequently, perhaps monthly. He would \nuse it with friends. After college he moved to another state and might have used marijuana \nonce a year. (GE 3) \nApplicant was asked by the government investigator if he ever had a positive result \non a drug test. He said that after his 2019 arrest for possession of marijuana, he asked \nthe court for leniency. The judge asked him if he was willing to take a drug test, and he \nagreed. He said he had not used marijuana recently and did not believe his test would \nshow a positive result due to passage of time. The result was positive for marijuana.

Once he completed the \nrequirements directed by the court, the charge was dropped. \nApplicant was asked by the investigator why during his previous interview, he failed \nto disclose or discuss his marijuana use that occurred within the past seven years. He \nsaid he was not asked by the investigator about his marijuana use in his first interview. \nHe explained that the marijuana found in his car did not belong to him. He is not a drug \nuser, and he was not under the influence of drugs when he was arrested. He was further \nasked why he failed to disclose his marijuana use that was within the last seven years. \nHe said he did not consider marijuana a drug and that he had never been a frequent user. \nHis use was rare, especially post-college. He was asked if he was charged with \npossession of marijuana in the last three years, he must have known marijuana was \nillegal. Applicant explained that marijuana is legal in some states, so he still did not think \nof it as illegal. He said he did not intend to lie. He said he does not currently use marijuana \nand does not classify it as an illegal drug in his mind. He also said he wanted to protect \nhimself. (GE 3) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in his April 2021 \nand March 2022 SCAs when he responded \u201cNo\u201d to having used marijuana in the last \nseven years. The SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts \nduring his May 2021 interview with a government investigator when he stated that he had \nnever used illegal drugs when in fact he used marijuana recreationally from 2010 to 2019. \nIn his answer to the SOR for each allegation, he stated: \nI admit, I have used marijuana within the last 7 years. After failing to initially \ndisclose the information to the investigative officer, I then informed an \ninvestigative officer about seldomly smoking marijuana. However, I \nunwillingly made the mistake of not changing my answer in the application \nafter the second conversation. I initially resisted the answer out of fear of \n[losing] my job but then realized I made a mistake. (Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant testified that he \u201cdibble-dabbled\u201d with marijuana use especially while in \ncollege. He said he did not disclose his illegal drug use because in a lot of states it is now \nlegal. He was asked if it was legal where he currently lived and last used it and he said \n\u201cno.\u201d He explained he had recently been hired for his job when he completed the SCA, \nand he was terrified of losing his job and being able to provide for his family. He thought \nif he answered \u201cyes\u201d he would lose his job. He said when he completed the second SCA \nit was a long process and he \u201cnegligently\u201d hit the \u201cnext\u201d button before confirming his \nresponse regarding his illegal drug use. He said he did not want to be seen as lying, and \nhe did not intentionally lie. He said the truth was he did use marijuana and should have \nsaid so and should have updated his answer. It is not a part of his life and his environment. \nHe said his past use does not define him.

I find Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in \nhis April 2021 and March 2022 SCAs by failing to disclose his past drug use. I find he \ndeliberately falsified material facts when he told the government investigator during his \nMay 2021 interview that he never used illegal drugs. (Tr. 30, 40-50) \nApplicant testified that after his arrest for marijuana possession in 2019, he was \nrequired to take a drug course over a couple of day, which he completed. He was also \nrequired to perform community service, which he also completed. After completion of \nthese requirements, the charge was dropped. (Tr. 51-57) \nApplicant apologized for his actions. He stated that his conduct did not define his \ncharacter, and he will not make this mistake again. (Tr. 67) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u20ac, \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will\nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination,\nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national\nsecurity eligibility:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative.  \nI have considered all of the evidence. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts on his April 2021 and March 2022 SCAs \nwhen he responded that he had not used illegal drugs in the past seven years. He \ndeliberately falsified material facts to a government investigator during his May 2021 \ninterview when he said he had never used illegal drugs. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nI did not believe Applicant\u2019s actions were negligent when he failed to disclose his \nprior drug use or that he made a mistake by hitting the \u201cnext\u201d button. He was aware of his \npast drug use and deliberately failed to disclose it on three separate occasions when he \nhad a duty to be truthful. I did not find his explanations credible that marijuana was not \nillegal in some states, so he did not have a duty to disclose it because that is the way he \nthought about it. He had recently been arrested for possession of marijuana in a state \nwhere it was illegal. He tested positive for marijuana after his arrest. It was not until the \nfourth opportunity during his second interview with a government investigator that he \nfinally disclosed his past conduct. \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his concealment and \nfalsifications. His conduct is not minor and did not happen under unique circumstances \nthat are unlikely to recur. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nA security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or \nparse the truth narrowly. The government has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information. That compelling interest includes the government's \nlegitimate interest in being able to make sound decisions, based on complete and \naccurate information, about who will be granted access to classified information.

Despite having more than one opportunity to \nset the record straight, Applicant repeatedly failed to do so by providing false information. \nThe above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information on his SCAs and provide \ntruthful responses to a government investigator raises serious concerns. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On that date, \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence. \nApplicant testified but offered no documentary evidence. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. I left the record open until April 7, 2023, for possible submission of \nadditional documentary evidence in mitigation or rebuttal. Neither party submitted any \nadditional evidence, and the record closed as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on April 5, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 64 years old. He married a citizen of Thailand in 2015, after meeting \nher while vacationing in Thailand for a month. His wife is now a legal resident of the United \nStates. His two previous marriages ended by divorce in 1989 and 1999. Applicant has no \nchildren. He attended some community college classes during the 2013-2014 school \nyear. He began his current employment as a quality control inspector with a major defense \ncontractor in July 2018, but has worked primarily on commercial product lines. He served \nin the Marine Corps from June 1978 to April 1986, when he was administratively \nseparated before the end of his enlistment. He received a General discharge, at paygrade \nE-3, following several incidents of misconduct for which he received non-judicial \npunishment. He held a Secret security clearance during his Marine Corps service, but it \nlapsed after his discharge. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 6, 23-26.) \nApplicant submitted an electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on September 17, 2021, seeking to obtain national security eligibility so he could \nperform quality control inspection duties on some military projects without requiring an \nescort. Applicant\u2019s SOR listed 11 delinquent consumer debts, totaling $34,502, based on \nhis e-QIP disclosures of financial issues, and credit reports obtained by the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) while investigating the application. During his hearing, \nApplicant acknowledged the validity of all the alleged debts, which are also confirmed by \nmore recent credit reports that were submitted as Government Exhibits. He said that he \nformally denied some of them in his Answer because, due to their age, they no longer \nappeared on a credit report he obtained. (GE2\u2013GE 5; Tr. 22-23, 28-34, 37, 45.) \nDuring his October 2021 interview with an OPM investigator, Applicant said that \nhe had sufficient resources to repay all of his delinquent debts but did not intend to do so \nbecause he wanted to retain those funds for use on other spending during his impending \nretirement. He also said that his second former wife is aware of his delinquent financial \naccounts but, \u201cDue to cultural differences, [his] current wife is not aware of [his] debts.\u201d \n(GE 2.) \nApplicant testified that all of the SOR-listed debts remain unpaid and that he had \nno intention to repay them to save funds for retirement. Although not alleged in the SOR, \nApplicant filed two previous Chapter 7 bankruptcies, in May 1996 and October 2003, that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresulted in discharge of his unpaid debts at those times.

(GE 2; GE 6; GE 7; Tr. 18-19, \n34-40, 44.) \nApplicant testified that he does not care whether he is granted national security \neligibility because he intends to retire and obtaining a security clearance would only \nbenefit his employer\u2019s ability to detail him to perform work without an escort. The record \nremained open after the hearing for submission of documentary evidence of professional \nperformance, financial updates, or other character references but neither party submitted \nanything further. (Tr. 44-47.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admittedly still owes 11 delinquent consumer debts, totaling $34,502. \nThese debts have been delinquent for so long that some have fallen off current credit \nreports, and his reason for not attempting to discharge them through his third Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy filing predated his 2015 marriage to his third wife. Through his financial \ninability and expressed unwillingness to repay them, they remain unresolved. These facts \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial delinquencies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under any of these conditions. All the \ndelinquent debts of concern remain unresolved, demonstrating his current unreliability \nand the likelihood of recurrent problems. He had earlier unpaid debts discharged through \nChapter 7 bankruptcies in May 1996 and October 2003, which shows that his continuing \nfailure to meet financial obligations is not a recent development. He provided no evidence \nthat he obtained or is following professional counseling to establish financial \nresponsibility. There are no documented indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control. His delinquent debts remain outstanding. Given his history of financial \nirresponsibility and plans to retire from his employment, they create ongoing potential for \nfinancial coercion and increased risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and \naccountable Marine Corps veteran who defaulted on more than $34,500 in voluntarily \nincurred debt after two previous Chapter 7 bankruptcies. He documented no attempt, \nworkable plan, or available resources to resolve his current delinquent debts despite his \ncurrent employment with a defense contractor for more than six years. There remains \nsignificant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, which is likely to \ncontinue. Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the Financial Considerations guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDAVID M. WHITE \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

On \nFebruary 6, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of video \nteleconference hearing, scheduling the hearing on March 12, 2024. The hearing was held \nas scheduled. At the hearing, I received four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4), eight \nexhibits from Applicant (Applicant\u2019s exhibit (AE) A through AE H), and Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. At the close of the hearing, I left the record open for 30 days to allow Applicant \nthe opportunity to supplement her exhibits.

She was one of \nthe highest-paid employees of her company, earning approximately $166,000 per year. \n(AE B; Answer at 1) In 2013, budget cuts led to her being laid off. (Answer at 1) Initially, \nApplicant was able to somewhat offset the financial loss caused by the layoff through \nworking as an independent contractor. (Answer at 1) Over the next two years, however, \njobs became increasingly scarce, and the pay offered for the services that she rendered \ndecreased considerably compared to what she was previously paid. In addition, the \nindustry changed, as companies lowered their pay rates for the type of services that she \nprovided. (AE B) Applicant looked for jobs outside of her field but was unsuccessful \nbecause it was difficult as a woman in her fifties \u201ctrying to find a job outside [the] world \nwith [her] skills and abilities.\u201d (AE I at 2) At or about the time Applicant\u2019s salary began \ndrastically decreasing, she was diagnosed with high blood pressure. Unable to afford \nhealth insurance after the salary decrease, she had to pay much more out of pocket than \nshe did previously, further straining her finances. (Tr. 72) \nIn 2016, Applicant lost two of her most lucrative remaining contracts, triggering a \nfinancial crisis from which she has yet to recover.

(AE B) In November 2017, Applicant attended credit counseling. (AE C \nat 2; AE K) Although the counselor recommended that she file for bankruptcy protection, \nshe opted not to pursue it because of concerns it could cause her to lose her security \nclearance. (AE I at 1) Applicant then applied for consolidation loans from two different \ncompanies on two separate occasions, most recently in 2022. (Answer at 1; AE D) Each \ntime, her application was rejected. (Answer at 1; AE D) Applicant also considered \nretaining a credit repair agency to negotiate settlements on her behalf. (Answer at 1) She \nultimately did not retain this company because \u201cit sounded shady . . . especially because \nthey wouldn\u2019t tell [her] what their fees were.\u201d (Answer at 1) \nAs of September 2022, Applicant had incurred $94,000 of delinquent debt, as set \nforth in the SOR. Subparagraph 1.a, totaling $30,445, is the second mortgage that she \nused to help finance the purchase of a home. (Tr. 69) She sold the home in approximately \n2018 after her finances had taken a turn for the worse. (Tr. 32, 70) She thought that the \nsecond mortgage was satisfied through the sale of the home. (Tr. 70) Applicant contacted \nthe creditor in January 2023 to negotiate a settlement. (Tr. 52) The creditor offered to \nresolve the debt if she paid $15,000. Applicant was unable to afford this amount, and it \nremains outstanding. (Tr. 52) She did not take steps to resolve this debt earlier because \n\u201cthere were so many other things that were going on\u201d with her finances. (Tr. 52) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b is a delinquent credit card, totaling $18,385. \n(Tr. 53) It became delinquent in the latter part of 2016 at or about the time Applicant\u2019s \nincome drastically decreased. (Tr. 53) Applicant contacted the creditor to negotiate a \nsettlement. The creditor offered to settle the debt in exchange for Applicant\u2019s paying 50 \npercent of the loan. (Tr. 54) Applicant could not afford to make this payment. Currently, \nthe debt remains outstanding. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d is a credit card totaling $7,599. Applicant \nsettled this debt with a lump-sum payment of $5,699. (Answer at 6; AE F) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e, totaling $926, is a credit card. In March \n2023, Applicant arranged to settle this debt for $526; however, she was unable to follow \nthrough on the settlement plan after she had to purchase tires for her car. (Tr. 26) It \nremains outstanding. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f, totaling $474, is a credit card. It became \ndelinquent in 2017. (Tr. 60) Applicant has made no plans to satisfy it. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant owes the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.g, totaling $27,424, to a credit \nunion. She originally contacted this creditor in 2017 to attempt to settle this account. When \nthe creditor told her that it was going to write off this debt, she ceased attempts at \nresolving it. (Tr. 61) \nApplicant owes the federal government $27,000 in delinquent income taxes. (Tr. \n64) She incurred this delinquency after she borrowed money from her retirement \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvestment account in response to her employment crisis in the mid-2010s and failed to \ndeposit the money back into the account to prevent incurring excessive interest and \npenalties. (Tr. 65) Applicant entered a payment plan to resolve the IRS delinquency. The \ndate that she began making payments is unclear from the record. She began falling \nbehind on the payments in 2023. (Tr. 66) \nUnable to make the IRS payments, Applicant applied for and was approved for a \nhardship program. Under this program, she will again apply for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection. (AE I at 2) While the Chapter 7 plan is proceeding, her delinquent tax \npayments will be stayed. With the help of her bankruptcy attorney, she will attempt to \nobtain a discharge of tax debts predating tax year 2021. Applicant anticipates that once \nher tax interest and penalties and her commercial debts are discharged, she will be able \nto pay the remainder of the tax delinquency within six months. (AE I at 2) \nIn February 2023, Applicant satisfied a debt totaling $470, owed to a cell phone \ncompany, that is unlisted in the SOR. Currently, Applicant has between $30,000 and \n$40,000 invested in a retirement savings account. (Tr. 36) She owns two cars that are \npaid off. (Tr. 36) Because of her age, she is close to retirement, and she does not want \nto withdraw any money from her retirement accounts. Applicant supplements her income \nthrough part-time work with a restaurant delivery service and a grocery delivery service. \nThe amount that she earns with this work varies by season. Most of the time, she does \nnot earn that much money; however, during holidays she sometimes earns up to $800 \nper week. (Tr. 27, 40 \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. Per a coworker, she \u201cdemonstrates \nunwavering dedication and professionalism in her work, [and] is punctual, reliable, and \nalways willing to go above and beyond to ensure tasks are completed to the highest \nstandards.\u201d (AE J) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable, and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquency triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax, as required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nApplicant lost her job in 2013. Although she attempted to offset the lost income \nthrough independent contractor work, she was never able to remotely generate the \nincome that she made before the layoff, as her income continued to decrease, reaching \nits nadir in 2022 when she was earning only ten percent of what she earned before the \nlayoff. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were compounded by the loss of health insurance, \nleading to increased out-of-pocket medical expenses that coincided with the decrease in \nincome. \nThrough Applicant\u2019s financial struggles, she consistently took steps to mitigate \nthem, including selling her home, applying for consolidation loans, going to credit \ncounseling, consulting debt reduction companies, and performing part-time work. She \nhas managed to reduce her SOR debt by $5,699 through satisfying the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.d, and she satisfied a $470 delinquency that was not alleged in the SOR. \nShe is now in the process of filing for bankruptcy protection. Under these circumstances, \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nApplicant continues to struggle with her financial well being. Selling her house did \nnot entirely eliminate the mortgage debt, she has not consistently made payments on her \nincome tax payment plan, her application for a consolidation loan was rejected, and the \ndecision to borrow money from her retirement fund aggravated her problems, as she was \nunable to pay the resulting tax penalty. Consequently, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \napplicable only to the extent that she initiated payment plans. Nevertheless, I conclude \nthat Applicant acted responsibly given her limited resources. (See, e.g., Case No. 08-\n06567 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009)) I am unable to discern any other reasonable \nactions she could have taken to satisfy her creditors in light of her limited financial \nresources. Ultimately, although Applicant has made limited progress in satisfying her \ndebt, the good-faith nature of her efforts, together with the fact that the debts were caused \nby circumstances beyond her control, lead me to conclude that Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concern.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to the mitigating conditions, I also considered the lengthy time that \nApplicant has held a security clearance, and her strong work performance. Moreover, I \nwas particularly cognizant of the conundrum Applicant faced as an aging employee \nwhose skill-set no longer generates the income she had earned previously in her career. \nUpon considering all the mitigating and disqualifying conditions in the context of the \nwhole-person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(GE 1, GE 3 at 5, 8; Tr. at 25-26) He did not \nprovide a copy of, nor did he reference the laws in State 1 or State 2, that he proclaimed \ndecriminalized the recreational use of marijuana. During the hearing, he testified that he \nstopped using marijuana because he did not want his marijuana use to continue to affect \nhis job: \nI stopped [using marijuana] because I knew then after getting into this \npredicament, way after the arrest and after my probation passed. \u2026 I didn\u2019t \nwant it to affect my job any further. (Tr. at 52)   \nHe went on to state that he developed physical fitness goals, and he didn\u2019t want his \nmarijuana use to affect his workouts. He felt that using marijuana \u201cjust makes [him] lazier, \nmakes [him] want to do less;\u201d and he wanted to better himself. (Id.) \nApplicant admitted during the hearing that he deliberately falsified information by \nfailing to disclose his 2017 marijuana use in his 2019 SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.c), because he was \nconcerned that admitting he used marijuana would hinder his ability to obtain a security \nclearance. (GE 2 at 26; Tr. at 34-35, 61-62; Response to SOR of May 27, 2023) He \ntestified he was surrounded by a crowd during the time that was \u201cnot good,\u201d and everyone \nwas using marijuana. In his mind he believed that, if you could not be \u201clocked up in prison\u201d \nfor using marijuana, then it was \u201cnot illegal.\u201d (Tr. at 35-36) He stated that he did not know \nmarijuana was federally illegal, and that he did not ask anyone because his employer \nplaced a document on the reader board informing personnel that marijuana was \u201clegal\u201d in \nState 1, but that employees could not bring marijuana to work; or consume it on work \nhours. He stated he believed the rule was relaxed. (Tr. at 46-49) Applicant did not submit \na copy of the notice document or any evidence to support his statement. \nApplicant submitted two supplemental documents: a letter from his supervisor and \na letter from a colleague. His supervisor attested to his strong work ethic, and value to \nthe organization; along with his reliability, helpfulness, and positive attitude. His colleague \nstated the same, adding that he was more technically proficient because of Applicant\u2019s \nwillingness, and helpfulness in sharing his knowledge with others.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable include: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana from 2017 to about February 2022, to \ninclude after being granted access to classified information; and that in March 2021, he \nwas charged with possession of marijuana. His admissions are supported by other \nevidence in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply; however, AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply, \nas discussed infra. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, alleged: \u201cFrom about 2017 to about February 2022, you used marijuana \nwith varying frequency, to include after being granted access to classified information.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe alleged conduct is covered under AG \u00b6 25(a), but not under AG \u00b6 25(f).

See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022), for a discussion on the distinction between possessing or \nhaving a security clearance and being granted access to classified information. \u201cEligibility \nor access to classified information and the granting of access to classified information are \nnot synonymous concepts.\u201d Id. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nApplicant used marijuana in 2017 before he was granted a security clearance in \n2019; and he continued to use marijuana through February 2022. He told the DOD \ninvestigator that he stopped using marijuana at that time because he no longer had \ntransportation to the dispensary in State 2, where he stated he could purchase it legally. \nDuring the hearing he added that he also developed physical fitness goals, and he wanted \nto work out, and to be more active, and not lazy. Using marijuana made him lazier. He \ndisclosed his arrest in 2021, and the charge for possession of a fixed-blade knife. \nHowever, he failed to disclose he was also charged with possession of marijuana, which \nthe arresting officer found in his backpack. He claimed he did not know marijuana was \nfederally illegal, and that, based on a notice document on his employer\u2019s reader board, \nhe believed the rules regarding marijuana were relaxed. He was unable to present the \nemployer\u2019s notice document as evidence he claimed he relied upon to support his belief. \nIt is a long-established maxim of United States jurisprudence that ignorance of the \nlaw is not an excuse for failing to abide by it.

(Id.) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, \n2019)). \nApplicant has not mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is described in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process \nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe SOR alleged Applicant falsified material facts in his April 2022 SCA by failing \nto disclose he illegally used marijuana during the stated period (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and denying \nhe ever illegally used or was involved with marijuana while possessing a security \nclearance (SOR \u00b6 2.b). It also alleged he falsified material facts in his March 2019 SCA \nby failing to disclose he used marijuana in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Finally, the SOR cross-\nalleged Guideline H allegations concerning his marijuana use during the stated period, \nand his charge for marijuana possession (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted to deliberately falsifying his response in SOR \u00b6 1.c, because \nhe was concerned that admitting he illegally used drugs would hinder his ability to obtain \na security clearance. He also deliberately avoided disclosing his involvement with \nmarijuana in his 2022 SCA. He left out the fact that he was charged with possession of \nmarijuana, although he disclosed the other charge for which he was arrested: possession \nof a survival knife. He also responded \u201cno\u201d to all other questions concerning is illegal drug \ninvolvement in his 2022 SCA (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. Facts discussed here \nalso provide foundational support for allegations cross-alleged from Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d). His aberrant personal conduct here demonstrated a clear failure to abide by rules \nand regulations, making him vulnerability to exploitation. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(d) are only partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s subsequent \ndiscussion with DOD investigators concerning his drug involvement is insufficient to \nmitigate his personal conduct security concerns. These subsequent disclosures to \ninvestigators did not amount to a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his prior omission in \nthis case. Applicant is only partially credited with abstaining from illegal drug involvement \nsince February 2022. He stopped using marijuana because he was unable to travel to \nState 2 to purchase marijuana from a dispensary. It was not a \u201chard stop\u201d in February \n2022. He is credited with taking positive steps to alleviate stressors and change his \nbehavior, such as working out and staying healthy. The overall evidence here, however, \nleaves me with questions and doubts about whether he has overcome his personal \nconduct security concerns. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable. Comments discussed in Guideline H above also apply \nhere. Applicant exercised poor judgment by continuing to use marijuana after he was \ngranted a secret security clearance in 2019. He also provided false responses to multiple \nquestions concerning his drug involvement in his 2022 SCA.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all evidence in the \nwhole-person context, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate security concerns under \nGuidelines H (drug involvement and substance misuse) and E (personal conduct). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He graduated from high school in 2009 and attended college from 2009 to 2013 but did not earn a degree. He worked for various private companies until December 2016, when he began working for his current employer, a DOD contractor. He started as a pipefitter; he became in rigger in 2017; he worked in quality insurance in February 2020; he became an inspector in May 2021; and he was promoted to supervisor in December 2022.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 16, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on September 26, 2022, and requested\na hearing before an administrative judge.

He did not do so, and the record \nclosed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on July 25, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 32 years old. He is not married \nand does not have children. He graduated from high school in 2009 and attended college \nfrom 2009 to 2013 but did not earn a degree. He worked for various private companies \nuntil December 2016, when he began working for his current employer, a DOD contractor. \nHe started as a pipefitter; he became in rigger in 2017; he worked in quality insurance in \nFebruary 2020; he became an inspector in May 2021; and he was promoted to supervisor \nin December 2022. He started his own part-time business as a custom fishing lure painter \nin November 2021. He was granted a security clearance in 2019. As of the date of the \nhearing, he and his girlfriend lived together. (Answer; Tr. at 5, 7-8, 24-33, 43-44, 52, 54; \nGE 1-3) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent federal student loans, totaling \n$40,272. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h) The SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his Answer; background interviews conducted by an authorized DOD \ninvestigator in March 2019 and May 2022; and a credit bureau report from April 2022. \n(GE 1, 3-5) \nApplicant took out student loans in 2009 to attend college. His minimal income \naffected his ability to make consistent payments toward his loans when they became due \nin 2013 but acknowledged that he also did not prioritize paying due to his youth. He \nobtained deferments and forbearances on two or three occasions. He has not made any \npayments since he began working for his employer in 2016. His attempts to negotiate a \nrepayment plan with the creditor in around 2019, to include one that was income based, \nwere unsuccessful because he could not afford the creditor\u2019s proposed payments of \nbetween $500 and $800 monthly. He last contacted the creditor to verify that he did not \nhave to pay his student loans during the COVID-19 payment pause. He also suffered a \nwork-related injury between 2020 and 2021 that caused him to be out of work for one \nmonth. He indicated during his May 2022 background interview that he intended to \ncontact the creditor once the pause was lifted to negotiate a repayment plan. He stated \nat the hearing that he had not yet found the time to do so, primarily because of his work \nschedule, but he intended to. He also stated that he found it to be an overwhelming task. \n(Tr. at 13-14, 22-24, 30-38, 45-47, 49-53, 59-61; GE 2-4) \nApplicant earned approximately $30,000 when he began working for his employer. \nHis income steadily increased over the years, and his annual salary as a supervisor is \n$84,400, with the opportunity to earn more with overtime and shift differential. He had \napproximately $2,980 in his checking and savings accounts and $44,000 in his retirement \nsavings account. He and his girlfriend split the rent and utilities. He anticipated earning a \nprofit from his part-time business in 2024. He planned to apply his increased earnings \nand his profit from his part-time business to resolve his outstanding student loans. He has \nnot received credit counseling. His 2022 credit report does not reflect any other delinquent \ndebts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds...  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control; and \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. \nNonetheless, under AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder his circumstances. While Applicant intends to resolve his student loans and has \nthe financial means to begin doing so, he had not yet taken any steps toward doing so as \nof the date of the hearing. He has not received financial counseling. He needs more time \nto establish that he has his finances under control. I find that these financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",
