Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s (DoD) intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n1 \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. \nOctober 19, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on October 5, 2009, detailing security concerns under \npersonal conduct. \n  \n \nOn February 13, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn April 22, 2010, I was assigned the case. On June 10, 2010, DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing for the hearing held on July 1, 2010.  \n \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 8, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was held \nopen to allow additional information from Applicant. No additional material was \nsubmitted. On July 12, 2010, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). \n \nModification to the SOR \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel (DC) moved to amend the SOR. In the last \nsentence of Paragraph 1.d. subparagraph 1.b.2 is listed twice. DC moved to replace the \nsecond entry of 1.b.2 with 1.b.3. There being no objection from Applicant, the motion \nwas granted. (Tr. 17) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a of \nthe SOR. He admitted the factual allegations as to the other SOR paragraphs, with \nexplanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated \nherein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old staff maintenance logistician who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. \n33) He is currently assigned overseas.  \n \n \nApplicant was in the U. S. Army from February 1980 through February 1983. In \nMay 1981, Applicant\u2014then age 21\u2014after being stopped for running a red light, was \nfound to be in possession of cocaine. Applicant received non-judicial punishment under \nArticle 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for wrongful possession of \ncocaine. He was reduced in rank to PV2, ordered to forfeit $279 pay per month for two \nmonths, and he received 30 days in correctional custody. (Ex. 8) \n \nFrom May 1982 through August 1982, Applicant was in a hospital after he broke \nhis jaw and arm during a training mission. He fell 40 feet resulting in his jaw being wired \nshut. (Tr. 35) His wrist injury was painful. Every couple of weeks, he had to get a new \ncast for his wrist. Pain medication was restricted due to the possibility he might swallow \nhis tongue. He roomed with three other soldiers and one day after having his cast \nadjusted, he was in pain. When he returned to his room, his roommates were smoking \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                          \nmarijuana and suggested it would relieve his pain. (Tr. 36) On August 16, 1982, he was \nobserved smoking marijuana.  \n \n \nIn September 1982, Applicant\u2014then age 23\u2014was investigated for the offenses \nof wrongful possession of marijuana, possessing contraband (a smoking device), and \nwrongful use of marijuana. (SOR \u00b6 1.b. (2)) The charges were determined to be \nunfounded. (Ex. 7) No action was taken related to the offenses. (EX. 7) Applicant \nreceived counseling related to the incident, but never received Article 15 punishment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wrist injury resulted in a P-3 medical profile, which restricted his use \nof his right hand. Without the full use of his right hand, Applicant realized he would not \nbe promoted and, in 1983, he left the Army as an E-4. (Tr. 37)  \n \nIn December 1991, he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence of Liquor (DUI) and Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). After leaving a bar, he \nwas stopped by the police when his car hydroplaned into the other lane of traffic. \nApplicant declined to take a breath analyzer test. At court, he pleaded no contest to the \ncharges, was fined $1,200, required to perform 24 months probation, and to attend a \ndefensive driving course. Applicant completed all the requirements and his probation \nwas reduced to one year. (Ex. 5) Applicant asserted his probation officer told him the \narrest would be expunged after seven years. (Tr. 41)  \n \n \nIn November 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application, \nStandard Form (SF) 86. (Ex. 2) Question 24 asked Applicant if he had ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. He answered \u201cNo\u201d \nto the question and did not list the two drug-related incidents or his 1991 DUI/DWI \narrest. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) When he completed the SF 86, he failed to remember the three \nincidents. The Article 15 had occurred 22 years before he completed his 2003 SF 86. \nThe DUI/DWI incident had occurred 12 years earlier. In October 2007, when Applicant \ncompleted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (Ex. 1), \nhe again failed to lists the three incidents because he had forgotten about them. \nApplicant also stated he was confused by some questions on the questionnaires which \nlimited the scope of inquiry to the previous seven years. (Tr. 41)  \n \n \nBoth questionnaires asked about having \u201cever\u201d been \u201ccharged with or convicted \nof any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs.\u201d He should have listed his DUI/DWI arrest \nin response to this question. In 1981, he received non-judicial punishment2 for \npossession of cocaine, but was never arrested for this incident. The more specific \nquestion related to disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ), to include non-judicial and Captain\u2019s mast, are listed in Section 23. f of the e-\nQIP (Ex. 1) and question 25 of the SF 86 (Ex. 2). Both questions limit the scope of the \nquestion to seven years.  \n \n \n2 Non-judicial punishment is not a charge. A charge under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) \nrequires a charge sheet, which is not part of the Article 15 procedure.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn November 2003, Applicant began working for a contractor in Iraq assigned to \nthe installation property book office, which controlled property assigned to individuals. \nHe worked for the contractor until March 5, 2005. In October 2004, Applicant received a \ncertificate of appreciation for his excellent duty performance. (Tr. 50, Applicant\u2019s SOR \nResponse) In November 2004, a new site lead arrived who was Applicant\u2019s supervisor. \n(Tr. 27) The site lead ran the office. (Tr. 44)  \n \nApplicant and the site lead did not agree on how the office was being run. \nApplicant believed accountable property was being issued without proper tracking \ndocuments. Applicant believed the site lead was a micromanager whose methods were \nvery chaotic. (Tr. 27) He also believed some of the site lead\u2019s conduct not only violated \ncompany policy, but also defrauded the government. In February 2005, the contractor \nassigned a new country manager to Iraq. When Applicant reported what he believed \nwere policy violations to the new country manager, the manager failed to take action. \nWhen the manager failed to act, Applicant reported the violations to the local Criminal \nInvestigation Command detachment (CID). The day after he reported the violation to \nCID, Applicant was told he would be returning to the states. Applicant believed he was \nreturning to be assigned to a new location and new position.  \n \n \nIn February 2005, Applicant was scheduled to move from one contractor location \nin Iraq to another location. His job with the installation property book office was to \nremain the same. When items are transferred from one location to another, items are \nmoved by shipping container and transferred from the property book at the losing \nlocation and to the property book at the new location. (Tr. 28) \n \nOn February 28, 2005, CID started investigating Applicant for theft and failure to \nobey General Order 1a (Ex. 9). It was alleged Applicant was attempting to move \nunaccounted property to his new location. The violation of General Order 1a allegation \nrelates to an attempt to ship two AK-47 machine guns and ammunition to the new \nlocation without authorization. \nApplicant asserted items were put in a shipping container to be transferred from \none location to another in-country. (Tr. 54) Applicant documented those items on a form \n11-3161, hand receipt for property. (Tr. 53) The hand receipt itemized the items by \nserial number. A copy of the 11-3161 was attached to the outside of the shipping \ncontainer and another was placed inside the container. (Tr. 57) Applicant asserts the \nsite lead signed the authorization for the goods to be shipped. (Tr. 58) When Applicant \nreviewed the list of items being investigated, he did not recognize some of the items. \n(Tr. 56)  \nIn rebuttal, DC offered the Final Report of Investigation (ROI) issued on May 12, \n2005. (Tr. 53, Ex. 9) Only the four page ROI was introduced at hearing. None of the \nsworn statements, exhibits, or other substantiating documents were attached to the ROI \nor present at hearing. The ROI referenced five sworn statements, including one from \nApplicant. The ROI attachments could establish or refute the allegations being \ninvestigated. Department Counsel (DC) was asked to review the file to determine if any \n\n \n5 \n \nadditional information or documents related to the ROI could be provided. (Ex. 61, 64) \nNo additional documents were provided. (Hearing Exhibit I)  \nThe ROI stated the investigation was terminated because it was determined that \nfurther investigation would be of little or no value or the leads remaining to be developed \nwere not significant. (Ex. 9) The ROI indicates the commander\u2019s report of disciplinary \naction taken was pending. No indication of action taken was included in the record. \nApplicant had not seen the ROI until presented in rebuttal at the hearing. (Tr. 59-60)  \n \n \nAfter returning to the states, Applicant received an email from a new country \nmanager asking if Applicant wanted to return to Iraq. (Tr. 39) Applicant did not want to \nreturn to his prior location and what he believed was a hostile work environment. \nApplicant informed the manger he was done working for the contractor. (Tr. 29) Having \nrefused a new position, Applicant\u2019s employment with the company ended. The next day \nhe received an email informing him he was no longer an employee of the company. \nApplicant was never informed he was being fired or terminated for cause from his \nemployment. (Tr. 28, 29) Additionally, he did not leave by mutual agreement following \nallegations of misconduct. The year after he left, the contractor lost all government \ncontracts it had in Iraq.  \n \nIn May 25, 2005, three months after the contractor\u2019s project manager\u2019s last \ncommunication with Applicant, the project manager sent a letter (Ex. 3) to the CID \nstating Applicant was terminated for cause and was not eligible for rehire by the \ncontractor. The reason given for the termination was Applicant\u2019s \u201cactions while deployed \nto . . . Iraq. . .\u201d The letter was not sent to Applicant and he never saw a copy of the letter \nuntil provided by the DC in preparation for the hearing. As previously stated, Applicant\u2019s \nlast communication with the contractor was shortly after his return to the United States. \n(Tr. 65) \n \nSince July 2007, Applicant has been working overseas for a different contractor \nproviding logistics for maintenance of vehicles. In March 2010, he transferred from Iraq \nto Afghanistan. (Tr. 33) His current living arrangements in Afghanistan are rough. His \nliving area is a six feet by seven feet area in a tent. The showers and latrines are in \ntents. There are no TVs or radios. (Tr. 52) \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 2007 e-QIP, he listed his prior \nemployment in Iraq. In response to Section 22 of that e-QIP, Applicant did not indicate \nhe had been fired from a job, quit a job after being told he would be fired, left a job by \nmutual agreement following allegations of misconduct, or left a job for other reasons \nunder unfavorable circumstances.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n\n \n6 \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 15 articulates the security concerns relating to \npersonal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \nIn March 2005, when Applicant returned to the United States, he assumed he \nwould be transitioning into a new position with the contractor. The contractor had work \nsites at locations throughout the United States and overseas and employees routinely \nreturned to the United States before going to a new location.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last communication with the contractor\u2019s project manager, or any \nother official from the contractor, was an email asking him if he wanted to return to Iraq \nand continue working for the contractor. This email was received shortly after his return \nto the United States. Applicant had no interest in continuing to work for the contractor, \ntold the project manager so, and his employment ended.  \n \nOn May 25, 2005, the contactor\u2019s project manager sent a letter to the CID \nindicating Applicant was terminated, with cause, and was not eligible for rehire by the \ncontractor. (Ex. 3) This letter was sent after the May 12, 2005 final ROI was sent. The \ntermination letter was never sent to Applicant and he did not see it until he received a \ncopy in preparation for the hearing.  \n \nThe Final ROI stated the CID investigation was terminated and closed. At the \ntime of the Final ROI, the Commander\u2019s Report of Disciplinary Action Taken was still \npending. The record fails to contain what, if any, action the commander took. None of \nthe substantiation related to the investigation was attached to the ROI. Applicant asserts \nhe did everything properly in relation to the transfer of the property. The ROI does not \n\n \n8 \n \nstate Applicant was punished for any misconduct or any action was taken against \nApplicant based on the investigation. \n \nThe termination notice sent to CID is sufficiently vague that I will not speculate as \nto Applicant\u2019s actions while employed by the contractor. Applicant was not provided an \nopportunity to contest the contractor\u2019s termination notice. I find for Applicant as to SOR \n\u00b6 1.a.  \n \nThere is nothing in Applicant\u2019s return to the United States in March 2005 that \nwould indicate he was being sent back to the United States as a form of punishment or \nbecause he was being terminated. Applicant worked for the contractor in Iraq from \nNovember 2003 until March 2005. Employees routinely returned to the United States for \nmorale purposes or before being assigned to a new work location. The contractor had \nnumerous work sites in the United States and at overseas locations and Applicant \nthought he would be assigned to a new location.  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 2007 e-QIP, he listed his prior \nemployment with the contractor ending in February 2005. He never indicated he had \nbeen fired, terminated from, left a job following allegations of misconduct, or left a job for \nother reasons under unfavorable circumstances. Applicant\u2019s last communication with \nthe contractor was an offer of continued employment with the contractor, which \nApplicant declined. During this last communication between Applicant and the \ncontractor, there was no indication Applicant was being fired, terminated for cause, left \nfollowing allegations of misconduct, or left under other unfavorable circumstance. Had \nany of these events occurred, it would have been unlikely the country manager would \nhave been asking Applicant to continue working for the company. I find Applicant did not \ndeliberately falsify material facts in his answer to the question in section 22. I find for \nApplicant as to SOR \u00b6 1.c.  \n \nA CID investigation was conducted concerning the transfer of property from one \nlocation in Iraq to another. The CID report contains a mere one-paragraph synopsis. \nThe investigative activity and summaries of witness statements are not provided. \nProperty would routinely be removed from the property log at one location and added to \nthe property log at a new location, once goods were moved. Applicant put some items in \na shipping container after he had completed an itemized form 11-1431 hand receipt, \nwhich the site lead authorized. Applicant recognizes some of the items listed in the CID \nreport and has no idea about other items.  \n \nFailing to get along with one\u2019s supervisor or the fact Applicant complained to the \nCID about his supervisor is not the type of conduct contemplated in the SF 86 question, \nwhich asks if Applicant left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances. \nThe record fails to establish Applicant left the job because an investigation was being \nconducted. Moreover, the validity of the report\u2019s conclusions cannot be substantiated \nbased on the record evidence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nIn 2003, Applicant completed an SF 86. Twelve years earlier he had been \narrested and convicted of DUI/DWI. This arrest and conviction should have been listed \non the questionnaire because the question asked if he had ever been arrested or \ncharged with an alcohol-related offense. His probation officer told him it would be \nexpunged after seven years. Applicant=s failure to disclose this arrest does not, in itself, \nprove he did so in a deliberate effort to conceal those facts from the government. \nApplicant denial of intentional falsification is relevant, but not conclusive. An intent to \ndeceive or mislead the government does not require direct evidence and can be inferred \nfrom circumstantial evidence, but this is not the case here. Applicant asserted he failed \nto list the arrest because a number of the questions limited the scope of inquiry to the \nprevious seven years. Although this question is not so limited, Applicant assumed the \nprior seven years was the scope of this question. His explanation for not listing the \nDUI/SWI arrest that occurred 12 years earlier is credible. Applicant did not list the arrest \non his 2003 SF 86 and for the same reasons failed to list it on his 2007 e-QIP. My \nreasoning and findings are the same for both questionnaires. \n \nThe question in Section 23 d. of Applicant\u2019s October 2007 e-QIP and question 24 \nof his November 2003 SF 86 asked Applicant about his police record relating to drug \noffenses and are not limited as to when the offenses occurred. However, it is SF 86\u2019s \nquestion 25. \u201cYour Police Record \u2013 Military Court\u201d and the e-QIP\u2019s question Section 23 \ne., which specifically asks about disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ and non-\njudicial punishment. These questions are more directly on point as to Applicant\u2019s drug \nuse while in the military. In 1981, Applicant received an Article 15 for possession of \ncocaine. Questions 25 (SF 86) and 23.e (e-QIP) relating to court-martial or other UCMJ \ndisciplinary proceedings limit the time being considered to the seven year period just \nprior to completing the questionnaire. Applicant\u2019s 1981 Article 15 had occurred more \nthan 22 years before he completed his SF 86 and more than 25 years prior his \ncompleting the e-QIP. Applicant had not thought about the Article 15 or the other drug \nrelated incident until reminded of them when he received the SOR. (Tr. 37)  \n \nIn 1982, Applicant was investigated for possession and use of marijuana. His \ncommander took no action as to the incident and Applicant did not receive an Article 15 \nor other disciplinary action. Since he was neither \u201ccharged with\u201d nor \u201cconvicted\u201d of an \noffense, he was not required to list this on his SF 86 or his e-QIP.  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his questionnaires, he did not list his 1981 nonjudicial \npunishment. Only non-judicial punishment occurring within the previous seven years \nhad to be listed. However, this does not prove Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \ninformation. Applicant denied any intentional falsification. Deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement \nto the Government, when applying for a security clearance, is a security concern. But \nevery inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and \nmaterial. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nWhen Applicant completed his questionnaires, he failed to remember this \nnonjudicial punishment. Having observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor, listened to his \ntestimony, and noted the event occurred more than 20 years earlier, I find his answers \nwere not deliberate omissions, concealments, or falsifications. I find for Applicant as to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In March 2005, a CID investigation \ncommenced. When Applicant returned to the United States, he assumed he would \nshortly be reassigned to a new location with the contractor. He never knew, until \nreceiving a copy of the letter just prior to the hearing, that he had been terminated for \ncause. One cannot lie about being terminated if he never knew he was terminated. \nApplicant never attempted to hide his employment with the contractor. He listed his \nemployment, but did not list being fired or terminated for cause because the last he \nknew, the contractor was offering him continued employment.  \n \nMore than 20 years before he completed security clearance questionnaires \nApplicant was involved in two drug-related incidents while in the military. One resulted in \nno action and the other Article 15 punishment, neither of which he was required to list.  \n \nI had ample opportunity to evaluate Applicant\u2019s demeanor, observe his manner \nand deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his \ncandor or evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his testimony. It is my \njudgment that his explanations regarding the completion of the questionnaires and his \n\n \n11 \n \nprevious employment are consistent and, considering the quality of the other \ninformation before me, are believable.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20141.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs. The Applicant used a variety of illegal drugs while in college. He began using marijuana in August 2001, during his first semester of college. He used it once or twice each summer until May 2008. (Tr. p. 36). His last use of marijuana occurred during his college graduation. He used marijuana at social party situations, where large amounts of alcohol were consumed. Applicant attributes his illegal drug and alcohol abuse to a period in his life where he felt very insecure. His parents were divorcing, and for the first time in his life he had to pay for his college education on his own. This required that he work to support himself, pay his college tuition, and balance his school work. During this period, the Applicant abused prescription drugs on three occasions. In 2001, he used Percoset, that he had previously been prescribed following a neck surgery, on one occasion, for a sprained ankle.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 22, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D.,  Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on July 29, 2008.  On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline H for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 23, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on May 28, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 12,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for July 14, 2009.  The Government offered two exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered thirteen exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through M.  He also\n\n2\ntestified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on July\n28, 2009, to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  The transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) was received on July 23, 2009.  The Applicant submitted two Post-\nHearing Exhibits referred to as Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B that were admitted\nwithout objection.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nREQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of CFR 21\nSection 1308.11 and United States Code, Title 21, Sections 802 and 812 which define\nthe Controlled Substance Act. Applicant had no objection.  (Tr. pp. 16-19).  The request\nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the\nrecord. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 26 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s of Science Degree in\nEngineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer, and is applying\nfor a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant used a variety of illegal drugs while in college.  He began using\nmarijuana in August 2001, during his first semester of college.  He used it once or twice\neach summer until May 2008.  (Tr. p. 36).  His last use of marijuana occurred during his\ncollege graduation.  He used marijuana at social party situations, where large amounts\nof alcohol were consumed.  Applicant attributes his illegal drug and alcohol abuse to a\nperiod in his life where he felt very insecure.  His parents were divorcing, and for the\nfirst time in his life he had to pay for his college education on his own.  This required\nthat he work to support himself, pay his college tuition, and balance his school work.      \nDuring this period, the Applicant abused prescription drugs on three occasions.\nIn 2001, he used Percoset, that he had previously been prescribed following a neck\nsurgery, on one occasion, for a sprained ankle.  He used Vicodin in 2001, on one\noccasion while partying with friends, and he used Xanax in 2008 on one occasion to\nhelp him sleep while in Las Vegas with a friend.    \nThe Applicant also used cocaine several times between June 2006, and May\n2008.  He used it with friends at social events to fit in with the crowd.  He did not enjoy\nthe effects it had on him.  On one occasion, in May 2008, he purchased cocaine from a\ncoworker for him and his friend to use.\n\n3\nThe Applicant used LSD on one occasion on New Years Eve 2007.  At the time\nof his use, he was under the influence of cocaine and ecstasy.  An hour after using\nLSD, he regretted his decision to use it.  He experienced the most scary and\nuncomfortable effect on his body.  (Tr. p. 43).       \nThe Applicant used ecstasy one time on New Years 2007.  At the time, he was\nunder the influence of cocaine and LSD.  \nAfter graduating from college in the summer 2008, the Applicant moved out of\nstate to pursue his professional career.  During spring 2008, the Applicant decided to\nstop using illegal drugs altogether.  He began to realize that his friends of the past that\nhad great potential were simply wasting their lives.  He realize that people who used\ndrugs were caught in a self-limiting cycle of behavior.  He also met a girl in March 2008,\nwho became his girlfriend, and who pointed out the consequences of his negative\nbehavior and encouraged him to replace them with more constructive ones.  \nOver the past year, he has made changes in all areas of his life.  He has\nimproved his financial situation, by paying off over $10,000.00 in credit card debt.  He\nput himself on a strict budget and is working toward paying off his student loans.   He\nhas significantly reduced his alcohol intake and has started getting involved in physical\nactivity, such as mountain biking and yoga to deal with his stress.  (Tr. pp. 46 and 60).\nHe no longer associates with any individuals in his past who used drugs.  He is\ncareful about the people with whom he is friendly.  He now chooses to be around\npositive people.  He no longer suffers from the insecurities that led him to use drugs just\nto fit in.  He no longer seeks the approval of others.  \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation of 2009, reflects ratings of \u201cexceeded\nexpectations\u201d and a pay raise.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A). \nNumerous letters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s Manager, coworkers,\nprofessional associates, landlord, friends and family attest to the Applicant\u2019s responsible\nnature and high ethical and moral character.  The Applicant is considered to be a\nperson of integrity who is direct, honest, dedicated and who has excellent technical and\ninteractive social skills.  He is considered extremely trustworthy and is highly\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and\nPost-Hearing Exhibit A).   \nApplicant submitted a letter of intent dated July 13, 2007, indicating that he will\nrefrain from the use of illegal drugs in the future and that if he uses illegal drugs again,\nhis security clearance will be subject to automatic revocation.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K).  \nApplicant underwent a controlled substance test on July 6, 2009.  The results\nwere negative for any type of illegal drug.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L).\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25. (a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.  (b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n26. (b).(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n26. (b).(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n26. (b).(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\n\n5\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges.\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d             \n                                   \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n6\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H of the SOR.  I have considered all of the\nevidence presented in this case, including the letters of recommendation, the favorable\nperformance evaluations and recent promotion, and the other accomplishments of the\nApplicant.  The Applicant used a variety of illegal drugs including marijuana, cocaine,\nLSD, ecstacy and on three occasions, he used prescription drugs without a prescription,\nnamely Vicodin, Percoset and Xanax while in college.  This was a stupid and childish\nthing to do.  He has a better understanding of the seriousness and effects of illegal\ndrugs and their addictive nature that can destroy a person.  However, he has seen the\nnegative and permanent effects illegal drugs have on people and he does not want to\nbe one of them.  The Applicant has not used any illegal drugs for the past fourteen\nmonths, and has no intention of ever using any illegal drugs again.  He is ashamed and\nremorseful for his misconduct in the past.  He has significantly matured since college,\nand no longer associates with illegal drug users.  He has increased is self-confidence\nand no longer needs to hang around with losers in society.  He has signed a statement\nof intent indicating that he will not use illegal drugs in the future and if he does, his\nsecurity clearance will be immediately revoked.  This further demonstrates his\ncommitment to a drug free lifestyle.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, and 25.(c) Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; apply.\nMitigating Conditions 26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\nsuch as: 26.(b).(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 26.(b).(3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence, and 26(b)(4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation applies.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 26 years old, educated,\nintelligent and successful.  He understands the responsibilities of an individual who has\nthe privilege of holding a security clearance.  He realizes the seriousness of illegal drug\nuse and how negatively it can effect his life.  He no longer uses illegal drugs, and is\nlooking forward to a successful career and a good life.  Under the particular facts of this\ncase, the totality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines\nas a whole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.  \n\n7\nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information at this time.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1.                                                                                                                      \n  \n  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On April \n27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on or about May 13, 20091; answered it on June 17, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.

I convened the hearing as \nscheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel announced that the government did not \nintend to pursue the allegations under Guideline E. Department Counsel requested that \nI either strike the portion of the SOR pertaining to Guideline E or find for the Applicant \non all the allegations under that guideline. I informed the parties I would find for the \nApplicant on the Guideline E allegations (Tr. 13-14)2.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

He described Applicant as a \ndedicated student, a hard worker, a supportive son and brother, and an attentive father \nand husband. He considers Applicant a person who is able to \u201cself-correct\u201d and who \ndoes not take his responsibilities lightly (AX B at 9).  \n \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy shortly after graduating from high school and \nserved on active duty from June 2000 to June 2006. In May 2001, he received a \nsecurity clearance and eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information \n(SCI). While in the Navy, he deposited money in an account for his mother every \npayday (Tr. 53).  \n \nApplicant decided to return to civilian life because deployments were hard on his \nfamily, and he was not being utilized in his field of expertise (Tr. 53). He was released \nfrom active duty under honorable conditions as a petty officer second class (pay grade \nE-5). Applicant and his wife grew up in unstable families, and they wanted to raise their \nchildren in a stable, family-oriented environment (Tr. 40, 68). Applicant remained in the \nU.S. Navy Reserve after his release from active duty and served in a paid drill position.  \n \nApplicant worked for a heating and air conditioning contractor after he left active \nduty. He took a substantial pay cut, and he found the work tedious and without career \npotential. He began working for his current employer in August 2006 (Tr. 54-55; AX A).  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana twice in October 2007. In November 2007, he tested \npositive for marijuana during a random urinalysis conducted in connection with his \nduties in the Navy Reserve. At the time of his positive urinalysis, he still held a \nclearance and SCI eligibility.  \n \nApplicant was fired from his job because of the positive urinalysis. He used \nmarijuana one more time in December 2007, right after he was notified that he was fired \n(Tr. 77; GX 3 at 3). His employer reconsidered, rehired him in late January 2008, and \nreinstated his clearance (Tr. 77, 86; AX A). The Navy Reserve separated him from his \npaid drill position in June 2008 (GX 6).  \n \n \nApplicant testified the triggering event for his marijuana use occurred when his \nmother visited him, his wife, and their newborn son. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother and \ngrandmother were visiting at the same time. While his sister was using his computer, \nshe found a picture of Applicant and his deceased father. Applicant had received the \npicture from an aunt. When his mother saw the picture, she accused Applicant of \nstealing it from her house. According to Applicant, his mother began screaming, cursing, \nand berating him. Applicant took her to his sister\u2019s house, where she continued to \nberate him (Tr. 58-59).  \n \n \nApplicant testified the incident with his mother left him \u201cdiscombobulated.\u201d He \ntestified: \u201cThe things that she put me through I suppressed deep inside and when she \ntriggered that other person, she was . . . yelling and screaming at me for no reason, I \n\n \n4 \n \n \njust, I guess it all came back and I was real hurt by that.\u201d He and his mother have been \nestranged since the incident (Tr. 59-60). \n \nAfter the incident with his mother, Applicant decided he needed something to \nhelp him relax, and he obtained two marijuana cigarettes from an acquaintance. He \nconsumed the cigarettes on two occasions in October and on one occasion in \nDecember 2007. He did not obtain any more marijuana (Tr. 63-64). \n \nAfter he learned about his positive urinalysis, Applicant sought out a Navy \nchaplain and talked about his suppressed feelings. After his counseling session with the \nchaplain, he felt more able to deal with those feelings (Tr. 78). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s on-site supervisor, a federal employee with 34 years of experience in \nlaw enforcement, is aware of his marijuana use, because Applicant told him about his \npositive urinalysis and described the extent of his use. This supervisor described \nApplicant as a dependable and meticulous worker who has made great contributions to \nthe agency he supports. He trusts Applicant fully. He believes Applicant has learned \nfrom his mistake and will not repeat it (AX B at 1). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager for the past two years describes him as a responsible \nperson and an effective technician (AX B at 7). A co-worker describes him as very \nsecurity conscious, very professional, a person of high integrity, and one who is eager \nto use his talents to promote efficiency (AX B at 5-6). A federal contract employee who \nserved with Applicant and worked under his supervision in the Navy considers him very \nconscientious (AX B at 8). \n \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant began taking college courses, working on a two-year \ndegree in technical management (Tr. 82; AX C). On August 26, 2009, he executed a \nnotarized declaration of intent not to use illegal drugs or abuse legal drugs, he agreed \nthat any illegal drug use or abuse will result in his security clearance being automatically \nrevoked (AX D).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \n\n \n5 \n \n \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \n\n \n6 \n \n \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24.3 \n \nGuideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b).  \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): Aany drug abuse@;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use\u201d;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): Aillegal drug possession, including . . . purchase\u201d; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement raises all these disqualifying conditions, shifting the \nburden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent.  There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use in 1996, while an adolescent in high school, was the \nproduct of immaturity, peer pressure, and an environment where drug use was \nprevalent and accepted. It was not \u201crecent\u201d and happened under circumstances that are \n                                                          \n3 Applicant held SCI eligibility in the Navy, but that eligibility is not at issue in this case. SCI eligibility is \ncontrolled by Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 704 dated October 1, 2008; and Intelligence \nCommunity Policy Guidance (ICPG) Numbers 704.1 through and 704.5, all dated and effective on \nOctober 2, 2008. The adjudicative guidelines for SCI are set out in Annex A to ICPG 704.3, and they are \nvirtually identical to the security clearance guidelines for cases involving Guideline H. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunlikely to recur. However, his earlier use of marijuana cannot be considered in a \nvacuum, and it must be considered in the context of all the evidence.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use while holding a clearance and SCI eligibility was a \nserious breach of trust. He used marijuana on three separate occasions in 2007, \nincluding once after learning about his positive urinalysis. His third use of marijuana in \nDecember 2007 occurred after he was fired, a circumstance that could recur. On the \nother hand, his most recent use of marijuana was preceded by eleven years without \ndrug involvement, including six years of honorable service in the Navy. He has \nabstained from drug involvement since December 2007. The triggering event, an angry \noutburst from his now-estranged mother that brought back unpleasant childhood \nmemories and caused him to revert to his childhood mindset, is unlikely to recur. He is \nhighly regarded by his supervisors, friends, and colleagues, who continue to trust him \neven after learning about his marijuana use. After considering all the evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement, I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is established.   \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant does not associate with \nother drug users, but he apparently still knows how to obtain marijuana. His family and \nwork environment have not changed. He has, however, abstained from using marijuana \nfor about 21 months. He has signed the statement of intent that effectively places him \non self-imposed probation. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) and (4) are established. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant has not sought or received any drug treatment. I have \nnoted, however, that he sought out and consulted with a Navy chaplain after learning of \nhis positive urinalysis, talked about his suppressed feelings, and found the consultation \nhelpful. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant successfully made a break from his turbulent and undisciplined \nchildhood when he joined the Navy. He served honorably and successfully in the Navy \nfor six years. He matured into a devoted husband and father and a valuable and reliable \nemployee. His wife, to whom he is devoted, strongly disapproves of drug use. He \nrelapsed into his old mindset when his mother angrily berated and embarrassed him \nduring a family gathering that was intended to be a joyous event. He was sincere, \ncandid, remorseful, and credible at the hearing. He made a serious mistake, but he has \ndemonstrated his determination to not let it happen again. His declaration of intent \nplaces him on self-imposed probation and provides strong motivation to remain drug \nfree. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on his drug involvement. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the criminal and personal conduct security concerns, but\nfailed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn March 31, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal\nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 20, 2010, admitting all of the allegations.\nHe requested a hearing, and the case was assigned to me on May 28, 2010. On June\n3, 2010, DOHA issued a notice of hearing for June 30, 2010. The hearing was held as\nSeptember 30, 2010\n\n2\nscheduled. I received eight Government exhibits marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1 to 8, five Applicant exhibits, marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A to E, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. I left the record open at the conclusion of the hearing, at\nApplicant\u2019s request, to allow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted,\nhe submitted eight additional exhibits that I received. (AE F to M) DOHA received the\ntranscript on July 9, 2010. \nProcedural Ruling\nAt the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as\nfollows:\n1.c. You are indebted to the United States Internal Revenue\nService for approximately $20,000 for the time period of 2001-2005.\nApplicant did not object, and I granted the motion.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old married man with three children, ages 20, 16, and\nseven. His two oldest children are from prior relationships. His 20-year-old son currently\nserves in the United States Navy. \nApplicant works in the information technology field. Since 2004, he has worked\nfor a defense contractor that focuses on making information technology more accessible\nfor the disabled. The program particularly targets disabled military veterans. (GE 6 at 4) \nAs a teen, Applicant used and sold illegal drugs. In June 1987, Applicant was\narrested and charged with possession of cocaine, marijuana and PCP. (Tr. 59). He was\nsentenced to five years in jail (suspended) and three years of probation. \nIn November 1988, Applicant was charged with manufacture/distribution of a\ncontrolled dangerous substance, possession of cocaine, possession of cocaine with the\nintent to distribute, and carrying a concealed knife. (Tr. 60) In February 1990, Applicant\nwas found guilty of the first charge. In April 1990, he was sentenced to ten years in\nprison. (Tr. 62)\nWhile Applicant was incarcerated, the state charged him with eluding an officer\nand resisting arrest. (Tr. 65) These offenses related to an incident that occurred\nbetween the incidents of June 1987 and November 1988. (Tr. 65) Under the terms of a\nplea bargain, Applicant pleaded guilty to lesser offenses and was sentenced to an\nadditional three years to run concurrent to the sentence he was already serving.\nApplicant was a model prisoner, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in general studies in\n1994 while incarcerated. (Tr. 28) Because of his good behavior, he was released after\nsix years. In one rehabilitation class that Applicant took while in prison, he learned what\n\nIt is unclear why Applicant completed two security clearance applications. He suspects that after leaving his\n1\njob in 2004 to take his current job, the original investigative process was terminated, and that he did not have\na need for a clearance on his current job until 2008. (Tr. 79)\n3\nhe characterized as the \u201cpeople, places, and things,\u201d philosophy of life. (Tr. 86)\nSpecifically, if one avoids people who are involved in illegal activities, and places where\nillegal activities occur, one\u2019s likelihood of staying out of trouble is increased. \nSince leaving prison, Applicant has abided by this creed, foregoing illegal drug\nuse and avoiding his old social milieu. He is highly respected on the job and in his\ncommunity. According to his supervisor from 2004 to 2006, Applicant was \u201can excellent\ntechnician\u201d who was \u201calways up to date on whatever he was working on.\u201d (AE C) \nCurrently, Applicant manages a staff of 15 desktop and network support\nadministrators.

Both provided references for him.\nOne of the officers characterized him as \u201can exceptionally intelligent person whom [the\nofficer] leans on for financial business, and spiritual guidance.\u201d (AE F) The other officer,\nwho characterized himself as \u201chighly selective of [his] personal circle of friends\u201d\nbecause of the nature of his profession, described Applicant as dependable, honest,\nand trustworthy. (AE G)\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in March 2004. He failed to\ndisclose his felonies in response to Question 21. Your Police Record - Felony\nOffenses - Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\nApplicant misread the question, thinking that he only had to report felonies within seven\nyears of the date he completed the security clearance application. (Tr. 73) Applicant\ndisclosed his criminal record to an investigative agent in 2005. (Tr. 76) \nApplicant completed another security clearance application in June 2008.  This\n1\ntime, he read it more thoroughly, and \u201ctook [his] time completing it. (Tr. 80) In response\nto Section 23D - Alcohol/Drug Charges, he answered \u201cyes,\u201d and described them at\nlength. \nIn 2001, Applicant purchased a laundromat. (Tr. 56) The business was\nunsuccessful, prompting Applicant to sell it in 2004 (Tr. 33) In 2005, the local\nmunicipality where Applicant operated the business obtained a tax lien against applicant\nfor $53,497 for unpaid sales and use taxes for tax years 2001 through 2004. Later that\nyear, the municipality filed another tax lien against Applicant. This lien covered tax year\n\n4\n2005 and totalled $6,748 . (GE 3 at 4) Applicant had filed his taxes his taxes timely\nduring the years in dispute, but miscalculated them. (Tr. 31)\nShortly after receiving the notice of tax liens, Applicant called the local taxing\nauthority to arrange a payment plan. (Tr. 33) In April 2009, Applicant \u201cwent down\nphysically\u201d to the local taxing authority and made a $100 payment toward the\ndelinquency. (GE 4 at 4) He has not made any additional payments since then.\nAt or about the time the local municipality filed the tax liens against Applicant, the\nfederal government audited his tax returns from 2003 through 2005 and concluded he\nowed an additional $41,864 (AE H; Tr. 55, 95) In June 2010, Applicant consulted a\ncertified public accounting firm to help develop a payment plan for his income tax\ndelinquencies. (Tr. 39; AE A) He retained the firm a month later, approximately three\nweeks after the hearing. (AE J) \nIn 2004, Applicant and his wife financed the purchase of a home with a variable\nrate mortgage. (Tr. 42) Shortly after the purchase, Applicant discovered the recordation\nfees were calculated incorrectly at the settlement, causing the bank to underestimate\nthe escrow portion of their mortgage payment. Also, over the next four years, the\nmonthly mortgage payments began to steadily increase. By 2007, it had more than\ndoubled from $3,800 to $8,000. (Tr. 92) In 2007, Applicant and his wife successfully\nrefinanced their loan. Under the new loan, the monthly mortgage was fixed at $4,000\nmonthly.\nIn 2009, Applicant\u2019s wife, who worked in the real estate industry, was laid off.\nApplicant was unable to manage the family\u2019s finances on his income alone.\nConsequently, both his mortgage payments and his car payments fell behind.\nCurrently, Applicant and his wife are receiving counseling through a state\nprogram that seeks to prevent foreclosures. (Tr. 50) Also, a week before the hearing,\nthey met with a debt counselor to consider consolidating their debts. (Tr. 50)  Recently,\nApplicant\u2019s wife obtained another job in the real estate profession. She will be paid a\nnominal salary in addition to a commission for any homes sold. As of the date of the\nhearing, she had not received her first pay check. \nApplicant earns $75,000 per year. He has approximately $15,000 invested in a\n401k plan. (Tr. 58) He intends to apply this money toward his mortgage if his efforts at\npreventing foreclosure are unsuccessful. (Tr. 58) Both Applicant\u2019s mortgage and car\npayments remain delinquent.\nIn June 2010, Applicant and his wife applied for a home loan modification. (AE\nM) If approved, the bank will reduce their monthly mortgage payment to 31 percent of\ntheir gross income. (Id.)\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n\n6\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when his laundromat business failed, and\nwere exacerbated when he discovered that he had miscalculated his state and federal\nincome taxes while the business was in operation. His ability to address these problems\nwas hampered by the drastic increase in his adjustable rate monthly mortgage payment\nand his wife\u2019s subsequent unemployment.\nIn the past four months, Applicant has retained an accounting firm to help him\nresolve his tax delinquency, sought help through a state program for distressed\nhomeowners, applied for a mortgage loan modification, and met with a credit counselor\nabout consolidating their debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(d) apply.\nAG \u00b6 14(c) only applies partially. Although there is ample evidence that Applicant\nis receiving counseling, it is too soon to conclude that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern under this guideline is as follows:\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process (AG \u00b6 15). \nApplicant\u2019s omission of his criminal record from a 2004 security clearance application\nraises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he misread the question is credible in light of his\nsubsequent disclosure of his arrests to an investigator and his inclusion of the arrest\nand the surrounding details on another security clearance application completed four\nyears later. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply, and there are no personal conduct\nsecurity concerns.\nCriminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (Id.). \n\n7\nApplicant was incarcerated for six years in the 1990s after being convicted of\nseveral drug-related charges. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d and 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply. \nAlthough Applicant admittedly was involved in using and dealing drugs, this\nconduct occurred more than 20 years ago when he was in his late teens to early\ntwenties. While in prison, Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. Since leaving prison\nApplicant has avoided the drug culture, pursued gainful employment, and gotten\nmarried. He is highly respected on the job and is a pillar of his community. The following\nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 apply:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training, or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe seriousness of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is outweighed by his immaturity\nwhen it occurred, the passage of time that has elapsed since it occurred, and the\nsignificant evidence of rehabilitation. Under these circumstances the likelihood of\nrecurrence is minimal.\nApplicant is an exceedingly productive member of society. Applicant testified\npersuasively that his motivation to excel on the job stemmed not only from a desire to\nearn a lucrative salary, but to his dedication to the people whom he is serving. \nHowever, these positive attributes cannot overcome the vulnerability to coercion\ngenerated by Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial difficulties. His income tax delinquencies\n\n8\naccrued because of good-faith mistakes made when he filed his returns. His ability to\naddress this problem was hampered first by the drastic increase in his monthly\nmortgage payments, then by his wife\u2019s job loss. Although Applicant is aggressively\ntaking steps to remedy his financial problems, too much uncertainty about his long-term\nfinancial situation exists for me to conclude that it poses no security concern.\nConsequently, upon considering Applicant\u2019s case in the context of the whole-person\nconcept, I conclude that he has not mitigated the security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Judd, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s sexual abuse of his stepdaughter raises security concerns that he\nfailed to mitigate. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nOn March 1, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nD, Sexual Behavior, J, Criminal Conduct, and E, Personal Conduct. DOHA took the\naction under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR on March 22, 2010. He denied all of the allegations\nand requested a hearing. The case was originally assigned to another administrative\njudge on April 5, 2010 and scheduled for April 29, 2010. On April 21, 2010, Applicant\u2019s\nAugust 30, 2010\n\n2\nattorney filed a notice of appearance, and moved to continue the hearing until after\nAugust 2010, the month that the state court scheduled the criminal trial involving the\nsame allegations. Department Counsel objected. The administrative judge partially\ngranted the motion, agreeing to continue the case from April 2010, but denying the\nrequest to reschedule it after August 2010. Instead, he scheduled it for May 24, 2010.\nOn May 7, 2010, the case was transferred to me. \nThe hearing was conducted as scheduled. The Government moved to admit nine\nexhibits, marked as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9. Applicant\u2019s counsel\nobjected to the admission of GE 3 through 9, and did not object to GE 1 and GE 2. I\nadmitted all of the Government\u2019s exhibits except GE 9. Also, I admitted one Applicant\nexhibit, marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and received the testimony of Applicant and\ntwo supporting witnesses. At the close of the hearing, I ordered Department Counsel to\nsubmit copies of the relevant state law governing Applicant\u2019s allegedly criminal conduct.\nHe submitted it within the time allotted and I marked it as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on June 4, 2010.\nEvidentiary Ruling\nAt the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by\nadding the following allegation, as follows:\n3.b. On or about January 2008, you sent your step-daughter, who was 13\nyears old at the time, a text message, which stated that she had a\n\u201cbanging ass,\u201d using a company cell phone.\nI granted the motion.

She then walked out of the room, went to the bathroom, and went to\nbed. (Tr. 77) \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter went to school the next morning. When she returned\nhome, she told her mother what Applicant allegedly did. (Tr. 77) Her mother then asked\nApplicant if he touched her daughter \u201con the butt.\u201d (Tr. 78) Applicant responded that he\ndid \u201cnot recall anything like that.\u201d (Tr. 78) She then ordered him to leave their home.\nThey have been separated since then.\nOn March 18, 2008, Applicant\u2019s wife went to court and sought a protective order.\n(Tr. 80) The judge issued the order. It restricts Applicant from any contact with either his\nstepdaughter or wife and requires visitation with his daughter to be supervised. (GE 2 at\n4) The order is still in effect. (GE 3)\nApplicant\u2019s wife then reported the incident to the local department of social\nservices. A child protective services social worker took a statement from Applicant\u2019s\nstepdaughter. (GE 5 at 3) This statement formed the basis of a criminal complaint filed\non March 19, 2008 charging Applicant with sexual abuse of a minor child, unlawful\nsexual contact with a child under the age of 14 (third degree sexual assault), and\nunlawfully engaging in sexual contact without the victim\u2019s consent (fourth degree sexual\nassault). (GE 5 at 1) The trial was originally scheduled for February 2009, but was\ncontinued multiple times. It is currently scheduled for August 2010.\nApplicant denies the allegations. He admits to rubbing his stepdaughter\u2019s feet\nand calves, but not her buttocks. (Tr. 74, 116) It was not unusual for Applicant to rub his\nstepdaughter\u2019s feet. (Tr. 85, 134; GE 5 at 2) He had rubbed them about 20 times before\nthe alleged incident. (Tr. 85) Her mother was aware of the foot rubs. (Tr. 87) After\nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter reached puberty, his wife asked him to stop rubbing her feet.\n(Tr. 87-88) His stepdaughter, however, continued to ask him for foot rubs. (Tr. 87, 121) \nOn the evening of the alleged incident, Applicant relented \u201cbecause [he] wanted\nher to be quiet\u201d so that his daughter, who was then a toddler, could get to sleep.  (Tr.\n1\n91) Applicant contends that after his daughter eventually fell asleep, he took her to her\nbedroom. (Tr. 91) When he returned to his bedroom, his stepdaughter \u201cwas still sitting\non [his] bed.\u201d (Tr. 92) She then asked him to resume rubbing her feet. (Tr. 92) Applicant\nobliged, and rubbed them \u201cuntil she popped up and said \u2018oh, I fell asleep\u2019.\u201d (Tr. 93) She\nthen left the room \u201cfor no apparent reason . . . without say[ing] anything to [Applicant].\u201d\n(Tr. 93)\nAccording to Applicant, his stepdaughter is a rebellious, emotionally troubled\nchild who was prone to hallucinations and on medications to control anxiety. (Tr. 39-40)\nShe had been receiving treatment from a psychiatrist for five months preceding the\n\nApplicant never reported the alleged hallucinations to his stepdaughter\u2019s psychiatrist. (Tr. 49-50)\n2\nApplicant did not use his personal cell phone to text his stepdaughter. Instead, he used his work-issued cell\n3\nphone that she did not recognize. (Tr. 57) Applicant knew that his work-issued cell phone was only supposed\nto be used for work-related purposes. (Tr. 58)\n4\nalleged incident.  (Tr. 51) Also, according to Applicant, she frequently lied about her\n2\nwhereabouts and the friends with whom she associated. (Tr. 46, 49, 53) In sum,\nApplicant characterized his stepdaughter\u2019s allegations as part of a broader continuum of\noppositional behavior stemming from unhappiness with her mother for getting\nremarried. (Tr. 51, 52)\nOne day in January 2008, while sitting at home next to his wife, Applicant\ndecided to send a text message to his stepdaughter. (Tr. 64) Neither Applicant nor his\nwife were upset with his stepdaughter or concerned about her safety. Rather, they were\nbored and wondering what she was doing. (Tr. 66) When Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter\nreceived his text message, she did not know that he had sent it. Instead, she thought it\nwas a friend who shared the same first name as Applicant.  Applicant then told his wife\n3\nthat he was \u201cjust going to kid around with [his stepdaughter] and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n(Tr. 62) His wife played along with the joke and told him to \u201cgo ahead and ask her a\ncouple of things.\u201d (Tr. 63) Applicant then sent his stepdaughter a text message that she\nhad a \u201cbanging ass.\u201d (Tr. 54)\nApplicant and his stepdaughter ended their phone-texting conversation. Later,\nApplicant\u2019s wife told his stepdaughter that he was the one who sent the text message.\nHis stepdaughter then got uncomfortable. (Tr. 63)\nApplicant contends that he had no prurient interest in his stepdaughter\u2019s\nbuttocks. (Tr. 63) Instead, he was merely seeking to build her self-esteem because \u201cshe\nhad been complaining . . . about how nobody comments on her . . . posterior.\u201d (Tr. 63)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the AG lists potentially disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nThe absence of a conviction does not preclude the Government from proving an\napplicant engaged in criminal conduct. (ISCR Case No. 99-0119 (App. Bd. Sept. 13,\n1999) However, the fact that an applicant has been arrested or otherwise charged with\na criminal offense, standing, alone, does not constitute proof the applicant engaged in\ncriminal conduct. (See ISCR Case No. 98-0424 (App. Bd. July 16, 1999) at p. 4)\nThe SOR is based primarily on GE 3, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter\u2019s statement to a\nsocial worker that the state used to draft its statement of charges. During Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony, he reiterated his denial of the allegations and asserted that his stepdaughter\nwas either lying or delusional. After considering both the Government\u2019s evidence and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony, I find that Applicant sexually abused his stepdaughter, as alleged.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. Although he vehemently denied the\nallegations throughout the security clearance investigative process, when his wife asked\nhim the day after the incident if the molestation occurred, he told her he did not recall.\nAlso, he testified that he had stopped massaging his stepdaughter\u2019s feet after she\nreached puberty, but resumed on the evening of March 16, 2008, in response to her\nrepeated requests so that she would be quiet and her younger half-sister, a toddler,\ncould get to sleep. However, after the toddler fell asleep, Applicant admitted that he\nresumed massaging his stepdaughter\u2019s feet. As for Applicant\u2019s contention that his\ndaughter was delusional, he testified that she had experienced hallucinations in the\nthree months preceding the episode; however, he never reported this to her psychiatrist.\nMost important, Applicant had manifested a perverse interest in his stepdaughter two\nmonths before the incident when he sent her a text message complimenting her\nbuttocks. \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under the adjudicative\nguidelines governing sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.\nSexual Behavior \nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\n\n6\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 12) Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a),\n\u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been\nprosecuted,\u201d and 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d\nApplicant presented no evidence establishing that he has undergone counseling\nto remedy whatever compelled him to molest his stepdaughter. Consequently, I cannot\nconclude that his conduct \u201cno longer serves as a basis of coercion, exploitation, or\nduress.\u201d (AG \u00b6 14(c)) None of the other mitigating conditions under this guideline are\nrelevant.\nCriminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (Id.)\nApplicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime\nor multiple lesser offenses.\u201d The potentially applicable mitigating conditions set forth in\nAG \u00b6 32 are:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense, and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s evidence that he did not commit the offense was limited to his\ntestimony, which was not credible. AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply.\nAlthough the offense occurred nearly two and a half years ago, Applicant is still\nawaiting trial, and a protective order prohibiting contact with his stepdaughter is still in\nplace. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. As discussed above, Applicant has neither attended\nany counseling nor sought treatment to address what compelled him to molest his\nstepdaughter. AG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply. \n\n7\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG 16(e),\n\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities\nwhich, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d\nThe relevant, potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, and\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nThese mitigating conditions are inapplicable for the same reasons as discussed under\nGuidelines D and E.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n8\nThe criminal allegations against Applicant remain pending as of the hearing date.\nThis fact, combined with the nature and seriousness of the allegations make Applicant\nan unacceptable security risk.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to section 11, relating to his employment \nactivities, he failed to list he had been employed for more than 30 years with the Drug \nEnforcement Agency (DEA), or that he left his job after being given the choice to resign \nor be terminated. Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the security concerns under \npersonal conduct. Clearance denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \n1 \nAugust 16, 2010\n\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on January 8, 2010, detailing security concerns under \npersonal conduct. \n  \n \nOn February 26, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated March 31, 2010. The FORM \ncontained 11 attachments. On April 29, 2010, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, \nalong with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nOn May 5, 2010, Applicant responded to the FORM. Department Counsel did not \nobject to the material and Applicant's response was admitted into the record. On June 4, \n2010, I was assigned the case.  \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding an \nadditional paragraph to \u00b6 1, alleging Applicant falsified his response to Section 22 for \nfailing to indicate on his March 2008 SF-86 that he had left a part-time job after his \nemployer was notified by the IRS of a garnishment action. In Applicant\u2019s response to the \nFORM, he stated he did not understand what Department Counsel had proposed. The \nMotion to Amend the SOR is granted, but for the reasons later described in this \ndecision, I find for Applicant on this allegation. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations of the SOR. \nHe admitted he was told by the DEA that \u201cthey were going to fire me unless I resigned.\u201d \n(Item 2) After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 64-year-old security officer who works for a defense contractor and \nis seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant is a Marine Corps veteran of the Viet \nNam conflict. (Answer to FORM, Item 4)  \n \n \nApplicant was employed with the DEA from 1968 through November 2005 as a \nproperty manager. (Items 7, 11) In May 1999, Applicant was suspended for five days \ndue to conduct unbecoming a DEA employee. Applicant sent an email to the individual \nin charge of payroll stating if he was not paid for the hours he had worked that Applicant \nhad friends in New York who would visit the individual. (Item 2) Applicant asserted this \nwas a joke, but it was taken as a threat. Applicant was immediately escorted out of the \nbuilding and told not to return until told to do so. In March 2000, he was called back to \nwork, given a five day suspension for poor judgment, and received a letter of reprimand. \n(Item 6)  \n \n \n2 \n\n \nUpon his return, Applicant\u2019s work performance was closely monitored. In 2005, \nhe was told his work performance was unsatisfactory and he would be terminated \nunless he resigned. Applicant chose to retire. Applicant asserted, but failed to \ndocument, that he chose to retire because of \u201charassment retaliation by [his] unit chief \nafter he was unsuccessful in getting [Applicant] out of the agency after doing all those \nnegative things against me.\u201d (Item 2) In November 2005, Applicant stated he filed an \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint. (Item 11) The findings \nof the EEOC complaint are not part of the record of the FORM. Applicant asserted, had \nhe chosen to contest his termination, he would have ultimately prevailed. (Answer to \nFORM)  \n \n \nIn November 2005, Applicant completed an SF-86 and listed his employment \nwith the DEA. (Item 1) He indicated he had been employed with the DEA since July \n1972. He was working at DEA when this SF-86 was completed.  \n \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant completed an SF-86. (Item 4) In section 11, Applicant \nlisted various part-time security jobs Applicant held from September 1972 through \nMarch 2008. Some of the part-time jobs he listed were for less than two years. \nHowever, he did not list his DEA employment. The instructions for answering section 11 \nindicate Applicant was to show \u201call Federal civilian service, whether it occurred within \nthe last 7 years or not.\u201d (Item 5) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 22, employment record, which asked him if, \nduring the previous seven years, he had been fired, quit, or left a job under unfavorable \ncircumstances. (Item 4) The instructions for answering section 11 (Item 5) state: \n \nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years? \n \n1. Fired from a job. \n2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired. \n3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct. \n4. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of \nunsatisfactory performance. \n5. Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances. \n \nIf you answered \u201cYes,\u201d provide a detailed entry for each occurrence to \nreport.  \n \nIn January 2009, in response to written interrogatories, Applicant asserted: \n \nI was under the impression that if I choose (sic.) to retire then I did not \nhave to state I left under unfavorable circumstances . . . However now I \nunderstand and see that I should have answered yes to the question that I \nleft under unfavorable circumstances. (Item 6) \n \n \n3 \n\n \nIn June 2008, Applicant had a personal subject interview with an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator. Applicant was asked about his employment \nwith DEA, his finances, and any discrepancies on his March 2008 SF-86. He informed \nthe investigator of the email he sent, the disciplinary action he received, and that he was \ntold his work was unsatisfactory in 2005, and would be terminated if he did not resign. \n(Item 7)  \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant resigned from his part-time job after the IRS \npresented his employer with a Notice of Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other Income. As \na secured security facility, his employer was required to forward this information to the \nDefense Security Service. (Item 8) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \n \n4 \n\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 15 articulates the security concerns relating to \npersonal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to report his DEA employment and his termination in \nresponse to question in Section 11 on his March 2008 security clearance application. \nApplicant was told he would be fired for poor duty performance if he did chose not to \nresign. The question in Section 22 clearly asks Applicant to lists if he left a job by mutual \nagreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance. He should have reported \nthe circumstances surrounding his leaving the DEA after thirty plus years. In fact, \nApplicant now acknowledges he should have answered the form differently.  \n \n \n5 \n\nApplicant=s false answer on his SF 86 and his response during his OPM interview \nconcerning his thirty plus years with the DEA and the circumstances surrounding his \nleaving that Federal employment tends to show questionable judgment, unreliability, \nand a lack of trustworthiness. & 16 (a) applies. \n \n Applicant\u2019s explanation rings hollow. His explanation was not credible to explain \nhis failure to disclose his more than thirty years of employment. Applicant disclosed \npart-time jobs starting in 1972 and disclosed some part-time jobs which lasted only two \nyears. A person does not list part-time jobs of two years and unintentionally forget a \nfederal service job of more than thirty years. His assertion that he was not being \ndeceptive is unpersuasive.  \n \nWith thirty plus years in Federal service, Applicant would have completed \nnumerous security questionnaires. He provided a copy of one page of his November 15, \n2005 SF-86 where he listed his DEA employment. I note that when he completed this \nSF-86 he was still working for the DEA and had not yet been terminated. I find Applicant \ndeliberately falsified his answer to questions in Section 11 and 22 of his March 2008 \nsecurity clearance application.  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions related to personal conduct apply. Applicant did \nnot make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts (AG \u00b6 17(a)). There was no refusal or \nfailure to cooperate. AG \u00b6 17(b) \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or \nconcealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and \ntruthfully,\u201d does not apply.  \n \nThe offense is not minor; Applicant left his job with the DEA after more than thirty \nyears after being told he would be terminated if the did not resign. AG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant acknowledged his employment when questioned by the OPM investigator. \nThere is no indication his answers to the SF-86 were caused by stress or factors \nbeyond his control. AG \u00b6 17(d) \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d does not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d has limited application. He did \ninform the OPM investigator of his employment and the factors surrounding his leaving \nthe DEA, thereby reducing his vulnerability. AG \u00b6 17(f) \u201cthe information was \n \n6 \n\nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability\u201d does not apply because the \ninformation was substantiated.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his employment history and adverse termination \ndemonstrates a lack of candor required of public trust personnel. The government has \nan interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an \nApplicant before making a public trust decision. The government relies on applicants to \ntruthfully disclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived \nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse \ninformation about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report \ninadvertent violations or other concerns in the future, something the government relies \non to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate \ngovernment interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.  \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant quit a part-time job. His employer had received a \nNotice of Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other Income from the IRS. His decision to stop \nworking meets none of the criteria listed in Section 22 of his SF-86 that would require \nhim to report this termination on an SF 86. He was not fired from the job, told he would \nbe fired, left following misconduct, left following allegations of unsatisfactory \nperformance, or left under unfavorable circumstances. It is true his employer had a duty \nto report the garnishment to the DSS, but his employer\u2019s obligation to report the \ngarnishment does not mean Applicant\u2019s choice to leave was due to unfavorable \ncircumstances. I find for Applicant as to this allegation.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \n7 \n\n \n8 \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was sufficiently mature \nwhen he completed his March 2008 SF-86 and chose not to reveal his employment with \nthe DEA or the factors surrounding his leaving. His explanation for doing so was \nunpersuasive.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his personal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nAdditional added subparagraph: For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn May 6, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 31, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 28, 2009, and waived his right to \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel prepared a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, on May 28, 2009, and mailed \nApplicant a complete copy on June 2, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on June 10, \n2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. Applicant submitted an exhibit on July 3, 2009, to which Department \nCounsel had no objection. DOHA assigned the case to me on July 24, 2009. I \nsubsequently marked Applicant\u2019s document as Applicant Exhibit (AE A) and entered it \ninto the record.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nWithin the FORM, Department Counsel submitted a formal request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to the Republic of China and Taiwan. \nAttached to the FORM are documents marked as Items I through XXIX pertinent to that \nrequest. Applicant did not object to my consideration of those Items. The request is \ngranted. I have considered for administrative notice purposes said source documents \nprovided, but not the persuasive briefs. I have also carefully considered only those \nsource documents that pertain to the factual specifics of each country from Government \nsources and other credible sources. I have not considered any editorial or extrapolated \ncomments or conclusions from unofficial sources. Hence, the facts administratively \nnoticed are limited to matters of general knowledge, and not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained \nunder Paragraph 1 of the SOR, and provided additional information in support of his \nrequest for a security clearance. His admissions are included in the following findings of \nfact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He was born in China and raised in Taiwan. In June \n1975, he graduated from a Taiwanese university with a bachelor\u2019s degree. As mandated \nby the Taiwanese government, he served in the Taiwanese navy for two years after \ncollege. In January 1978, he immigrated to the United States to attend graduate school. \nIn June 1979, he earned a master\u2019s degree in computer science. Since then, he has \nworked in the United States. In September 1986, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. \nIn July 1997, he began working as a computer engineer for his current employer, a \nfederal contractor. He completed his initial security clearance application (SF 86) at the \nsame time. (Item 4; 5; 6) In December 1997, he renounced his Chinese citizenship. (AE \nA) \n \n \nApplicant is married to a woman who was born in China. They were married in \n1983 in the United States. They have one child who was born in China in 1986. His wife \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1991. His son became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n1996. His wife earned a graduate degree from a U.S. university. His son became \ndisabled and visually impaired after an automobile accident in late 1997. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, now deceased, were born in China. Applicant has two \nbrothers. His oldest brother was born in China. He served in the Taiwanese Air Force as \na civil engineer for about ten years and retired more than twenty years ago. He is a \nlegal resident alien of the United States and citizen of Taiwan. He and his wife spend \ntime in Taiwan caring for his wife\u2019s elderly parents, who are sick and live there. They \nalso spend time in the United States. Applicant believes they will eventually live \npermanently in the United States. His brother\u2019s two sons graduated from U.S. \nuniversities. Applicant\u2019s younger brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resides in the \nUnited States. (Item 5; 6; 7) \n \n \nApplicant has four sisters, three of whom were born in China. The fourth was \nborn in Taiwan. Three of the sisters are naturalized U.S. citizens, residing in the United \nStates. His other sister is a naturalized Canadian citizen, residing there. (Item 5; 6)    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s elderly in-laws are citizens and residents of China.  His mother-in-law \nvisits Applicant yearly and helps care for Applicant\u2019s son. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is 80 \nyears old and retired from a manufacturing position 25 years ago. Applicant normally \nhas little contact with him. (Item 7) He does not provide financial support for his in-laws. \n(Item 7) \n \n \nApplicant visited Taiwan in 1992, 1994, 1996, 2007, and 2008. In 1992, he \nbrought his son to visit his father. In 1994, he visited his father, who had been \ndiagnosed with cancer. In 1996, he went there for his father\u2019s funeral. In 2007, he \ntraveled to Taiwan, alone, seeking medical help for his son\u2019s vision impairment. He met \nwith a physician, who was unable to be of assistance. During that trip, he stayed with \nhis brother. He subsequently went to Shanghai to visit his father-in-law before returning \nto the United States.  In 2008, he and his wife went to Taiwan for a two-week vacation. \n(Answer; Item 7) \n  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he may travel to Taiwan in the future, but denies that he \never said he would go to China. However, he has no immediate plans to go to Taiwan. \n(Answer)  \n \n \n  \n \nThere is no derogatory information in the file concerning Applicant\u2019s police or \nfinancial records. He has never been fired from a job. He has never used illegal drugs, \nor been involved in an alcohol-related incident. (Item 5; 6) Applicant is very appreciative \nof the health care benefits available to his son in the United States. He is grateful to his \nemployer and colleagues for the support they have given him since his son\u2019s accident. \n(Item 3) \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is a one-party Communist totalitarian \nstate with a population of over one billion people. It has an economy growing at 10% \nannually and expanding military forces, including its naval forces. It engages in \nindustrial and military espionage on a regular basis against the United States and other \ncountries. The United States and the PRC have been rivals since 1948, when the \nCommunists took control of mainland China, and the Nationalist government fled to the \nisland of Taiwan. Taiwan remains an issue of contention between the two countries. \n(Item I) The 2007 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission noted that the PRC has a large and aggressive intelligence gathering \noperation in the United States, particularly in the scientific and military fields. The PRC \nengages regularly in military, economic, and industrial espionage, including stealing \nnuclear weapons technology, missile design information, and commercial technology. \nThe PRC also obtains commercial information through the use of front companies, \nbuying dual-use technologies, and the direct collection of technology by non-intelligence \nagencies and individuals. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is integrated into the civil \nindustrial base in the PRC, known as the \u201cdigital triangle.\u201d (Item V) The 2007 Report to \nCongress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission states that the \nlinkages between the military and Chinese commercial information technology \ncompanies and the R&D institute are longstanding, \u201cas telecommunications and \ninformation technology in China were originally under military auspices and the \ncommercial relationships with state and military research institutes remain important.\u201d  \n(Id. at 102) China poses \u201ca growing threat to national security due to China\u2019s sustained \nefforts to obtain U.S. technology illegally.\u201d (Item IV at 38)  \n \nAdditionally, the U.S. State Department reported that the PRC has a poor human \nrights record, including but not limited to, denial of free speech and press, fair and open \ntrials, and other basic rights recognized by the international community. It also \nsuppresses political dissent, using arbitrary arrests, forced confessions, and \nmistreatment of prisoners as part of its operational methods to maintain control of its \npopulation. (Item III) Chinese security personnel routinely place tourists under \nsurveillance. (Item II) \n \n                                            Taiwan \n \n \nThe Nationalist Government of the late Chinese president Chiang Kai-shek was \ndefeated by the Communist forces of Mao Tse-Tung in 1948 for control of China.  While \nthe Communists established their government on mainland China, the Nationalists fled \nto the island of Taiwan and re-established their government there. Taiwan has a \npopulation of 23 million people, and a multi-party parliamentary democracy, which has \nevolved over the past 60 years. Taiwan did $466 billion in trade in 2007, having \ndeveloped a strong economy over the years. In 1979, the United States formally \nchanged its recognition from Taiwan to the Communist PRC government on the \nmainland of China as the sole legal government of China. (Item XVI) The United States \nmaintains an unofficial relationship with Taiwan under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nand sells defense military equipment to Taiwan pursuant to that law. Taiwan maintains a \nlarge military establishment. Taiwan is known as an active collector of U.S. economic \nintelligence. (Items XV; XXVII; XIX) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government is required to present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n \n \n \n6\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is articulated in AG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contact with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and part-time resident of Taiwan. His in-laws are \ncitizens and residents of China. He periodically has contact with all three family \nmembers. In 2007, he stayed with his brother who was residing in Taiwan at the time. \nHis mother-in-law visits him yearly. During his 2007 visit to Taiwan, he visited his father-\nin-law in China. These close relationships, especially with his mother-in-law, create a \nheightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because PRC agents \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nreside in Taiwan and China, and actively seek intelligence, classified, and economic \ninformation from United States sources and businesses. Applicant\u2019s connections to his \nrelatives also create a potential conflict of interest because the relationships are \nsufficiently close and consistent to raise a security concern about his desire to help \nthem, or Taiwan, or China, by providing sensitive or classified information. After the \nGovernment raised foreign influence security concerns, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to the disqualifications raised: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nGuideline \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant did not establish that \u201cit is \nunlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his \nbrother and in-laws] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts and close \nrelationships with his family members could potentially force him to choose between the \nUnited States and the PRC or Taiwan. He did not meet his burden of showing there is \n\u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d   \n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) has some application because Applicant has \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d He has lived in the United States \nsince 1978. He became a U.S. citizen in 1986. His wife and son are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens, residing in the United States. His brother and three sisters are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens, residing in the United States. He has worked for U.S. companies since earning \nhis graduate degree from a U.S. university in 1979, and for his current employer for 12 \nyears. He renounced his Chinese citizenship in 1997.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for 31 years and has been a \nnaturalized citizen for 23 years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to \nthe United States. His spouse and son are also naturalized citizens, residing with him. \nThey are his closest family members. His brother and three sisters are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens. Because all these family members live in the United States, they are less \nvulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power. The realistic possibility of such \npressure or duress with regard to those members is low. There is no evidence he has \never taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States. He \nrenounced his Chinese citizenship, and he has worked diligently for a defense \ncontractor since 1997.   \n \nFive circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First, \nthe PRC is a nuclear power and the PRC\u2019s government is a rival of the United States. \nMore importantly for security purposes, the PRC and Taiwan actively seek classified \nand industrial/economic information. They may attempt to use his sibling living in \nTaiwan or in-laws living in China to obtain such information. Second, he had significant \nconnections to Taiwan before he immigrated to the United States in 1978. He was born \nin Taiwan, and served in the Taiwanese military for two years. Third, his brother and \nsister-in-law are Taiwanese citizens, and still live in Taiwan, despite his brother\u2019s \nresident-alien status. Fourth, he has frequent and non-casual contact with his mother-in-\nlaw and brother. His mother-in-law visits him once a year. He visited his brother in \nTaiwan and his father-in-law in China two years ago. Since 1992, he visited his family in \nTaiwan five times and China once. These contacts with his brother and in-laws are \nmanifestations of his affection and regard for them. Fifth, he plans to visit Taiwan in the \nfuture.  \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance.

Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence. This is a close case, but \nultimately the evidence in the record leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security \neligibility and suitability.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 29, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated June 12, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On April 16, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as\namended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\n The Applicant responded to the SOR on May 18, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on June 3, 3009.  The matter was reassigned to the\nundersigned on August 31, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 15,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\npresented twelve exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 12, which were admitted\n\n2\nwithout objection.  The Applicant presented fourteen exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through N, and testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until\nNovember 28, 2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional\ndocumentation.  The Applicant submitted three Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection.\nThe official transcript (Tr.) was received on December 2, 2009.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 46 years old, and has an Associates\nDegree in Computer Science.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Data Entry\nInventory Specialist and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant joined the United States Army in June 1981, at the age of\neighteen, and  was assigned to an elite unit.  Applicant exemplified a model soldier for\neighteen years of service.  During this period, he held a security clearance and\ncompleted four combat tours: Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983, Operation\nDesert Shield in Saudi Arabia in 1990, Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991, and\nOperation Provide Comfort in Iraq in 1991.  He was promoted from E-1 to E-7, and\nachieved a great level of success.  While in the Army, the Applicant also completed 3.5\nyears of college course work, and obtained an Associate\u2019s Degree in computer science.\nApplicant was married from 1986 to 1993, and had one daughter.  He and this wife\ndivorced in 1993.  Applicant married his current wife in 2001, who is on active duty in\nthe Air Force, and they have three children from their marriage.\n         \nThe SOR sets forth nine delinquent debts.  The Applicant admits allegations 1(a),\nand 1(d), and denies the others.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  Credit reports of\nthe Applicant dated July 9, 2008; March 23, 2009; June 2, 2009; and November 14,\n2009, collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts.  (Government Exhibits 9, 10, 11,\n12.)  After testimony from the Applicant, it appears that several of the debts are\n\n3\nduplications of others.  The Applicant had only five outstanding debts, not nine.  He\nattributes his indebtedness to short periods of unemployment.  He was most recently\nunemployed from December 2007 to June 2008, and fell behind on his child support\npayments.  (Government Exhibit 3).  The record also indicates that he made efforts to\nassist his mother financially during her illness which caused him to turn to credit cards\nto pay his own bills.  Since becoming more aware of his debts and realizing the\nimportance of paying them on time, the Applicant has paid off three of the debts and is\nmaking payments of $420.00 monthly toward another.  The Applicant has contacted the\ncreditor concerning the fifth and final debt, and is in the process of resolving it.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 3).  \n1(a). and 1(h). of the SOR reflect the same debt.  A judgment entered against the\nApplicant in August 2002, by a rental car company  in the amount of $3,772.00 remains\noutstanding.  Applicant has done some inquiry, but has not set up payment plans or\nstarted to reduce the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit\n3).  \n1(b).  This delinquent debt owed to a cable company in the amount of $202.00\nhas been paid.  (Tr. p. 36 and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 1).  \n1(c).  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $201.00 has been\npaid.  (Tr. p. 37 and Post-Hearing Exhibit 1).  \n1(d)., 1(e)., 1(f). and 1(g). of the SOR reflect the same debt.  This delinquent debt\nowed to a state for back child support in the amount of approximately $16,823.00 is\nbeing paid through automatic paycheck deductions in the amount of $420.00 per month.\n(Tr. P. 40 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N).  \n1(i).  A delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $269.00 has been\npaid.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 3).\nApplicant\u2019s financial statement dated January 13, 2009, reflects that after paying\nhis regular monthly expenses, he has a net remainder of approximately $7,000.00 left at\nthe end of the month that will allow him to pay to pay his delinquent debts.\n(Government Exhibit 4).         \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant admits the allegation set forth under this guideline.  In 1993, upon\nreturning from the Gulf War, the Applicant learned that his wife had been having an\naffair, and he filed for divorce.  Medical records that contain a neurospsychological\nreport of the Applicant dated February 2000, which reflects back in time, indicates that\nin 1991, the Applicant started suffering from Major Depressive Disorder, which included\ntwo episodes of major depression.  One, in 1991, and another beginning in 1997, that\n\n4\ncontinued through the time he committed the offenses described below.  The\nApplicant\u2019s symptoms included depression, significant weight loss, mild to moderate\ndeficits in attention, memory and reasoning as was similar to those among other Gulf\nWar veterans, and general anxiety.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).  In the\nsummer of 1997, the Applicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and his\nfather left her after 39 years of marriage.  It was during this period that the Applicant\ncommitted the crimes that caused his military career to collapse as described below.\nApplicant has received counseling and medication for his condition.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit 2.)    \nIn about July 1999, the Applicant was tried and convicted at a General Court\nMartial for violating Article 121 (Larceny and wrongful appropriation); Article 123\n(Forgery); and Article 134 (Prejudicial Conduct) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nThe Applicant testified that he had worked his way up through the ranks and had a\nstellar career as an NCO.  He states that he had to work harder than most soldiers to\nachieve what he did, and he received many awards and accolades.  (Tr. p. 44).  \nFor the purpose of obtaining credit, the Applicant forged his roommate\u2019s\nsignature, and utilized her social security number and other identification data to obtain\nvarious lines of credit (credit cards), incurring a total debt of $9,326.03.  He used these\ncredit cards to purchase goods and services.  After being rejected for a credit card\nutilizing his own name, the Applicant also submitted a fraudulent credit card application\nbearing the name of his daughter.  Applicant was subsequently awarded the card with\nwhich he made charges.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  Applicant stated that he ultimately\npaid off all of the debt he wrongfully incurred, and the card was closed.  \nIn addition, the Applicant needed a credit card to conduct military business, so\nwhile another one of his other roommate was deployed overseas, he forged his\nroommate\u2019s signature and opened accounts in his roommates name.  When his\nroommate returned, his roommate tried to open an account and was denied.  His\nroommate learned that the Applicant had opened accounts in his name and charged on\nthe accounts.  He told the Applicant to pay off the debt.  Applicant did not comply with\nhis roommate\u2019s request as swiftly as he requested and he reported the Applicant  to the\ncommand.  There was an Article 32 investigation and then the Applicant was court-\nmartialed.  The Applicant pled guilty, and was found guilty of numerous Specifications\nunder both Articles 121 and 123.  He was sentenced to be reduced in rank from E-7 to\nE-1, to forfeit all pay and allowances, to be confined for six months, and to be\ndischarged from the United States Army with a Bad Conduct Discharge.  In July 1999,\nthe Applicant was discharged from the United States Army with a Bad Conduct\nDischarge.  (Government Exhibits 5, 6 7.)  Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked.\n(Government Exhibit 8.)      \nThe issue was raised that the Applicant did not receive the official separation\ndocumentation setting forth his bad conduct discharge from the Army.  (Tr. p. 57.)  The\nApplicant testified that upon his release from jail, he returned to the unit and continued\n\n5\nworking for about two or three months, without being paid.   In January 2000, his\ncommander asked him why he was still there if he was not getting paid.  (Tr. pp. 60 - 61\nand Tr. p. 65.)  At some point, the commander told him after looking at his LES that\nshowed no pay, that, \u201csince you\u2019re not getting paid, you\u2019re not in the Army anymore.\u201d\n(Tr. p. 66.)  Government Exhibit 13, is a copy of the Applicant\u2019s discharge from the\nUnited States Army.        \nThe Applicant is remorseful and disappointed by his criminal conduct, which\nruined his military career.  He admits his bad decisions and poor judgment.  Since then,\nand for the past eleven years, he has worked hard to demonstrate integrity,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment.  He acknowledges that he has learned a serious\nlesson from his mistakes that will never happen again.\nApplicant\u2019s military NCO evaluation reports for the years 1996, and 1997,\nindicate that he performed in the \u201cexcellence\u201d or \u201csuccess\u201d categories in every instance.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C).      \nApplicant received numerous military awards that include a Good Conduct\nMedal, (fifth award), the Army Commendation Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D, E and F.)\nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s current Program Manager dated November 17,\n2009, reflects that the Applicant is considered dependable, reliable and has an excellent\nrapport with staff and clientele.  He is highly respected and recommended for a position\nof trust.(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)\nApplicant received Certificates of Appreciation on January 20, 2009, and on\nSeptember 29, 2009, from his current employer.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G and L.)  \nLetter from customers who currently work with the Applicant reflect that he is a\nfamily man with integrity.  He is also hardworking and well respected by others.  He is\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits I and J.)  \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s minister of his church dated November 16, 2009,\nindicates that the Applicant brings a wealth of knowledge of leadership, management,\nenergy, and the ability to relate and work well with others.  He is considered to be a man\nof integrity, loyalty, honesty and competency.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K.)\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.  \n\n6\nThe Applicant admits allegation 1(b), and denies the others set forth in this\nguideline.  Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions dated\nJune 12, 2008.  Question 27(d) of the application asked the Applicant if in the last seven\nyears, he had any judgements against him that have not been paid?  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO.\u201d  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that in\nAugust 2002, a judgment was entered against him in the amount of $3,772.00.\nApplicant explained that he did not intentionally conceal any information from the\nGovernment on his application.  He had not reviewed his credit report and was unaware\nof the judgment at the time, and simply forgot about it.  (Tr. p. 40.)  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\n7\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n32.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality,\nrelease of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information;\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n\n8\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or\nresources.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n17.(c) The offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n17.(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n17.(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n9\nThe DoD Directive states: \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security\nguidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable\nshould be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that\nhave reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility, criminal conduct and personal conduct, which\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F), has engaged in criminal\nconduct (Guideline J), and has demonstrated poor personal conduct (Guideline E).  This\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nIn regard to the Applicant\u2019s finances, he was actually indebted to five separate\ncreditors, not nine.  He has since paid off three of the debts, is making payments toward\n\n10\nthe other, and is working to resolve the last one.  Applicant understands his\nresponsibility to completely pay off all of the debts set forth in the SOR.  At the present\ntime, he has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial\nresponsibility, or that he has resolved his financial indebtedness.  Considering all of the\nevidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or\nmitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nThere is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  Although Mitigating Condition 20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance applies, and is controlling.  The\nApplicant has initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve his debts.   Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \nThe Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and related personal conduct in the military in\n1999, was despicable.  He committed the offenses of Forgery, Larceny of Private\nProperty, and Prejudicial Conduct against his fellow soldiers and the Government.  As a\nresult, he was severely punished for these crimes.  This criminal conduct occurred\neleven years ago and has not recurred.  Since then, the Applicant has not engaged in\nany criminal misconduct of any sort, and in fact has shown that he can turn his life\naround after hitting rock bottom, and become a productive citizen in society.  For the\npast eleven years, he has demonstrated that he is not a criminal.  In fact, he is well\nrespected and comes highly recommended for a position of trust among his\nsupervisors, professional colleagues, friends and minister, all who know him well.  \nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  I have also considered Mitigation Conditions 32.(a) so much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and 32.(d) there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.  They also apply in this\ncase.  \nFurthermore, I find that the Applicant did not intentionally falsify his security\nclearance application when he failed to list the judgment against him.  He did not know\nor remember the extent of his indebtedness, or recall the judgement when he completed\nhis security clearance application. \n\n11\nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions: \n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered\nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available\ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information.  This\nincludes but is not limited to consideration of:  (1) untrustworthy or\nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of\nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or\nother government protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or other\ninappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule\nviolations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer\u2019s time or resources apply.  \nHowever, under the particular facts of this case, Mitigating Conditions 17.(c) The\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 17.(d) the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and 17.(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce\nor eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress also applies.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information, including the favorable evaluations and\nletters of recommendation.  For eighteen years, the Applicant honorably served our\ncountry in the United States Army, which includes four combat tours.  This outstanding\ncontribution cannot be overlooked.  In addition, for the past eleven years, except for his\nfew delinquent debts, he has overall demonstrated good judgment.  Under the particular\nfacts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed\nas a whole, support a whole-person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n     \n\n12\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    \nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: For the Applicant.  \n    Subpara.\n3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.   3.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.   3.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ronald C. Sykstus, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance for his employment with a defense contractor on \nDecember 9, 2007. On June 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 19, 2009. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 23, 2009, admitting all of the \nfactual allegations with explanation. He requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 10, 2009. The case was \nassigned to me on July 20, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 30, 2009, \nfor a hearing on August 20, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \ngovernment offered one exhibit, marked Government Exhibit (Gov. Ex.) 1, which was \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreceived without objection. Applicant submitted 27 exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits \n(App. Ex.) 1 through 27, which were received without objection. Applicant and six other \nwitnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on August 28, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice of Hearing \n \n \nApplicant did not sign for the Notice of Hearing sent by DOHA on July 30, 2009, \nsince he had been suspended from his employment. Applicant is entitled to 15 days \nnotice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant and his counsel discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of August 20, 2009, prior to the Notice of Hearing \nbeing mailed so notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing. Even though \nApplicant did not sign for the Notice of Hearing, he and his counsel waived the 15 days \nnotice requirement (Tr. 8). \n \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to India (Tr. 10-11, Hearing Exhibit I). The request and the \nattached supporting documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in \nthe record as a Hearing Exhibit. Applicant had no objection to the request for \nadministrative notice or the attached documents. Applicant also presented information \nfor administrative notice purposes concerning India (App. Ex. 20-26, Articles, various \ndates). The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanation. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant was born in a small village in India and is 44 years old. He was married \nin India in 1990, and has two daughters. His oldest daughter was born in India in 1995, \nand his youngest daughter was born in the United States in 1999 (App. Ex. 6, Birth \nCertificate, dated October 26, 1999). Applicant, his wife, and his oldest daughter came \nto the United States in 1997, and received permanent resident alien status in 2001. \nThey became United States citizens in 2006 (App. Ex. 3, 4, 5, Certificates of \nCitizenship, dated August 2, 2006). His youngest daughter is a United States citizen by \nbirth. His children are completely immersed in the American culture (Tr. 25-30, 71-72).  \n \nApplicant excelled in school in India and received his early education at magnet \nschools in India. He received his bachelor's degree in electronics and communications \n\n \n3 \n \n \nin 1988, and his master's degree in computer science in 1990 from a university in India. \nHe then worked for a year as a teaching assistant at the university before being \nemployed in the private sector in India. He worked for an Indian company that was a \nsubsidiary of a United States company from 1991 until 1995. During that time, he visited \nand worked at various United States sites in 1992 and 1995. He and his family moved \nto the United States in 1996 to take a position with one of those companies. He then \naccepted a position at his present location with another company. He is now employed \nby a defense contractor as a computer programming specialist. He has been \nsuspended from work with the company pending the outcome of his security clearance \nrequest. If he is granted access to classified information, the company will bring \nApplicant back to work (Tr. 30-37). \n \nApplicant admitted that his mother, father, three sisters, and a brother are \ncitizens and residents of India. His other brother is a citizen of India but resides in \nSingapore. Applicant's parents are in their 70s and are retired. His father was a farmer \nand his mother a homemaker. He talks to them by telephone about once or twice a \nmonth. His brother in India is a quality control supervisor for a pharmaceutical company.  \nHis brother in Singapore is a software developer. His sisters are all homemakers. His \nthree brothers-in-law work in agriculture and retail vegetable marketing. He talks to his \nsiblings about once or twice a month. None of his immediate family members have \nvisited the United States. Applicant sends his parents about $500 per year to assist with \ntheir medical expenses (Tr. 44-46, 53-55, 66-67). \n \nApplicant's father-in-law is a resident and citizen of India and is a retired \nvegetable vendor. Applicant's brothers-in-law are citizens and residents of India. One \nruns the vegetable vending business since his father's retirement, and the other is a civil \nengineer for a municipality. Applicant's three sisters-in-law are citizens and residents of \nIndia. Two are homemakers and the third is a teacher. The husbands of two of the \nsisters are retired, one as a civil engineer and the other as a teacher. The husband of \nthe youngest sister-in-law is a teacher. Applicant rarely talks to his in-laws. His wife \ntalks to them about once or twice a month. His father-in-law is the only member of his \nwife's family who visited them in the United States in 2008 for six weeks. Applicant \nclassifies his relationship with his family as a normal close family relationship (Tr. 44-60, \n68-69). \n \nApplicant and his family make trips to India every two years to see their family. \nOnly Applicant made the trip in 2006. Their first trip was in 2000, and they have gone \nevery two years and stay about three to four weeks each time. They stay with his or his \nwife's family when they visit (Tr. 60-63). \n \nApplicant has financial investments in both the United States and India. He has \nover $267,000 in investments in the United States comprising his house and a rental \ninvestment house, savings accounts, and mutual funds (App. Ex. 11 through 19, \nFinancial reports, various dates). Applicant opened investments in India after he left \nIndia to come to the United States. He and his wife own two residential properties and \nshares in a computer software company. Applicant and his wife purchased a share in \n\n \n4 \n \n \npiece of land for residential use. They built a house on the property for Applicant's \nmother and father to live in since it is near a medical facility where they receive their \nhealth care. While Applicant and his wife purchased the property together, it is listed \nonly in his wife's name. His parents own no interest in the property. The property was \nlisted in the SOR as valued at $19,000. The initial value was approximately $41,000, but \nthe value is now about $30,000 (Tr. 40-42, 69-70). Applicant and his wife also \npurchased an parcel of land for $8,000. At one time, it increased in value to $23,000. \nApplicant turned the property over to a Hindu temple trust fund for them to use for \ncharitable activities. The value when he gave it to the temple was about $15,000. He no \nlonger has an interest in this property (Tr. 42-43, 67-68, 70-72). Applicant and his wife \nalso purchased stock in a new Indian software company. His initial investment was \napproximately $41,000. The stock fell in value to about $30,000, and is now worth about \n$5,000 (Tr. 44-45; App. Ex. 27, net worth, June/July 2009). \n \nApplicant's wife testified that she was educated in India and received a \nbachelor's degree in physics and electronics. She came to the United States with her \nhusband in 1996. They first settled in another state and moved to their present location \nbecause her husband changed jobs after seven months. They have lived in the same \narea for about 12 years. At first, she was a homemaker, but in 2005 she and her \nhusband opened an Indian grocery store that she managed. They took on a partner \nafter a year and sold their interest in the store in 2007. She then attended the local \ncollege and is studying for a master's degree in accounting. She became a United \nStates citizen in 2006. Her daughters are fully involved in school and community \nactivities, especially soccer and dance. She and her husband volunteer in the schools \nand help with other activities in the community. They are very comfortable with the \nschool system and the community. She talks to her family in India about once or twice a \nmonth. She stays with her family when she visits India. She and her husband have a \nclose family relationship with their relatives in India (Tr. 74-83). \n \nAnother witness testified that he was born in India, but came to the United States \nover 20 year ago. He has a doctoral degree in agricultural science and is a full professor \nof crop science at the local university. He knows Applicant and his family from their \nattendance at local Indian cultural events and temple. He sees Applicant and his family \nabout two or three times a month. He opined that Applicant and his family are very \npleasant and social. They have visited each others homes. Applicant's daughter taught \nhis son to play soccer. Applicant has an excellent reputation in the local Indian \ncommunity (Tr. 84-89). \n \nAnother witness testified that he was born in Bangladesh and came to the United \nStates in 1981 to complete his education and received a doctorate in physics from a \nUnited States university. He taught college for ten years before working for a defense \ncontractor. He is a United States citizen and holds a security clearance. He has known \nApplicant since 2002 when they were working for the same company. He sees \nApplicant and his family socially as well. Applicant is perceived as friendly and helpful. \nHe does not believe Applicant poses any threat if he is granted access to classified \ninformation. He was a very valuable worker for the company. It was a big loss when he \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhad to leave because of the lack of a security clearance. He will be coming back to the \ncompany if granted a security clearance (Tr. 90-98). \n \nApplicant's neighbor testified that he has known Applicant for over five years as a \nneighbor. They interact in the neighborhood about two or three times a week. Applicant \nis perceived as a good person and Applicant's family is a good American family. He \ndoes not have any issues with Applicant being granted access to classified information \n(Tr. 99-103). \n \nAnother neighbor testified that she has known Applicant's family for over five \nyears. Their children play together, and Applicant and his wife have watched and cared \nfor her children. She has no problems with granting Applicant access to classified \ninformation (Tr. 103-107). \n \nApplicant's supervisor testified that she is an engineer and has a security \nclearance. Applicant worked for her for about 18 months before being suspended while \npending a grant of a security clearance. Applicant is a very competent worker and is \npolite and courteous. He is well-liked in the company and can accomplish any task \nassigned. She is aware of Applicant's family members in India, and has no concerns \nwith Applicant being granted access to classified information (Tr. 108-114). \n \nApplicant's former supervisor testified that he has known Applicant for over four \nyears and worked with him for over two years. He saw Applicant daily. He also knows \nApplicant's family. Applicant was an excellent worker. He does not believe Applicant \nposes any risk to national security if granted access to classified information (Tr. 114-\n119). \n \nApplicant presented letters of recommendation and support, and copies of his \nperformance evaluations. Applicant's department manager wrote that he has worked \nwith Applicant since November 2007. Applicant was a very knowledgeable software \ndeveloper and valued team member. He is a pleasure to work with and is appreciated \nby the other team members. He is not aware of any questions concerning Applicant's \nintegrity or character (App. Ex. 1, letter, dated July 28, 2009). Applicant's next door \nneighbor wrote that he has known Applicant and his family for many years. He and \nApplicant work on yard projects together and he sees Applicant almost every day. \nApplicant is polite and soft spoken, and he has complete trust in Applicant. He has not \nheard anything negative about Applicant. (App. Ex. 2, Message, dated August 17, \n2009). Applicant's performance reviews shows he meets or exceeds expectations and \nhas many ratings of excellent (App. Ex. 7, 8, 9, 10, Performance Review). \n \nIndia is not a country hostile to the United States and its interests are not inimical \nto the United States. The United States and India are the world's largest democratic \nrepublics and enjoy good relations. The United States is India's largest trading partner, \nwith trade doubling between the counties from 2004 and 2008. The relationship \nbetween the United States and India has been strengthened by growing economic and \nbusiness interests and the influx of Indian students in United States universities. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAlthough there have been concerns about India's nuclear program, the United States \nand India reached an agreement on the status of India's nuclear program.  \n \nThe United States and India share a common goal of promoting stability in Asia \nand fighting terrorism. There is a threat of terrorism in India, as reflected in the terror \nattacks in Mumbai in November 2008. However, the area of India where Applicant=s \nfamily resides is not listed as an area of safety or security concern or of instability \nbecause of terrorism.  \n \nThe United States government encourages small and medium size companies to \nexpand their business opportunities in India. Many United States based companies, \nincluding large computer service and software development companies, have subsidiary \ncompanies and do business in India. However, there have been convictions in United \nStates courts of businesses and their employees illegally exporting technology and \nsensitive products to India.  \n \nWhile the Indian government generally respects the rights of its citizens, there \nare some problems that still remain. Police employ arbitrary and abusive practices and \npolice corruption is pervasive. The United States and India are natural allies because \nthey share a growing convergence of values and interests. There is still some concern \nbecause of India's continued relationship with Iran. The people and the governments of \nthe United States and India engage together in virtually every field of endeavor. There is \nstrong and bipartisan support in both the United States and India to cooperate more \nclosely. Almost every middle class family in India has a relative studying, living, or doing \nbusiness in or with the United States (Hearing Exhibit 1, App. Ex. 20 through 26, \nArticles, various dates). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \"applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . , and has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance.\" \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interests. Adjudication under this guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is location, including but not limited to, such consideration as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism (AG \u00b6 6).  \n \n \nApplicant has frequent and extensive contact with his immediate family \nmembers, who are citizens and residents of India. He talks to his parents and siblings a \nfew times a month. He visits them for a few weeks every two years. He sends his \nparents funds for their support and purchased a house for their residence. His wife has \nsimilar contact with her parents, siblings, and their families. These contacts with his \nfamily and his wife's family are extensive, and they raise security concerns under \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 79(a) (Contact with a foreign \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) \n(Connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information).  \n \n \nI also considered FI DC AG \u00b6 7(d) (Sharing living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(e) (A \nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any \nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation). Applicant's in-laws are also \nconsidered a security risk for Applicant since he and his wife live together and she has \nclose contact with her family members who are citizens and residents of India. Applicant \nstill owns a residential property in India and has shares in an Indian software \ndevelopment company. \n \n \nThe mere existence of foreign family members is not sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. The nature of Applicant\u2019s contact with his and his wife's family \nmembers must be examined to determine whether it creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. The property or financial \ninterest must also subject Applicant to a heightened risk. \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative term \ndenoting increased risk over some normally existing risk that can be said to be inherent \nanytime a family member lives subject to a foreign government. Factors that heighten \nthe risk in Applicant\u2019s case are terrorist activities in India, and India's relationship with \nIran.  \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence to mitigate the security concerns for his family \nmembers in India. I have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \nAG \u00b6 8(a) (The nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.); FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b) (There is no conflict of interest, either because \nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, \nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest); FI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication with \nforeign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create \na risk for foreign influence or exploitation); and FI MC AG \u00b6 8(f) (The value or routine \nnature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are \nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, \nor pressure the individual). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d The underlying premise was \nthat an applicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a \nchoice between the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States. \nThere was no balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk. Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the United States \ninterest. The nature of the terrorist threat in India, as well as India's continued \nrelationship with Iran, places a burden on Applicant in mitigating the disqualifying \nconditions and the security concerns. Applicant's relationship with his family is close, so \nthere could be a circumstance where Applicant is placed in a position of having to \nchoose between his family members and the interests of the United States.   \n \n \nIndia has experienced terrorist activities in its country, but not any more than \nother countries. It is a democracy with strong economic, social, and political ties to the \nUnited States, even though it has an ongoing relationship with Iran. Applicant has little, \nsense of loyalty to India. He spent only his early and formative years in India and came \nto this country with his wife and young daughter for better living conditions and \nprospects for the future. This approach is no different than generations of immigrants \nwho came to the United States for a better life. He achieved his goal, finding good \nemployment for him and his wife, better education for his children, and more \nopportunities for his family. He and his family established that they have a deep sense \nof loyalty and admiration for the United States and its way of life. This is confirmed by \nthe testimony of his neighbors and co-workers. He and his family members became \nUnited States citizens as soon as they could, and have been successful citizens. They \nsee the United States as offering freedom, justice, and tolerance with an opportunity to \nreach their potential. While Applicant provided funds to assist his parents and \npurchased a house for them, he did so as a son and not to assist the government of \nIndia or any terrorist element in the country. His visits to India were in the ordinary \ncourse of visiting his family and not to further any political entity in India.  \n \n \nA conflict of interest in this case is extremely unlikely. Applicant's siblings are \nhomemakers and engineers or production workers. His in-laws are farmers and \nvegetable vendors. Their positions and activities, as well as their location in India, make \nit unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position to have to choose between their \ninterests and the interests of the United States. In balancing all of the factors mentioned \nand considered above, I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is such that \nhe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States \ninterest. FI MC AG \u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. It is clear from Applicant's and his wife's \ntestimonies that there is a close relationship their family in India. They talk to them \nfrequently, provided a house for Applicant's parents to reside, and Applicant sends \nfunds for their support. The relationship is close and not casual. FI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) does \nnot apply.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have investment property in India, but it is only a small \nportion of their total investments. Their investments in the United States are \nsubstantially greater than any investment in India. The value of the property and \ninvestment in India is small. In fact, the investment value has fallen during the recent \neconomic downturn. FC MC \u00b6 8(f) applies. Applicant has met his heavy burden to show \nthat his contact with his family and in-laws in India do not cause a security concern. I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated security concerns rising from his contact with his \nfamily in India. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I carefully considered all of the \ncircumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \nwell as the following factors in light of the whole-person concept. The whole-person \nconcept requires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single \nitem in isolation, to reach a commonsense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness. Applicant has a close relationship with his family members and in-\nlaws in India because he talks to them frequently by telephone, visits them every two \nyears, purchased a house for his parent's residence, and sends funds for his parents' \nmedical care. These simple facts alone might be sufficient to raise security concerns \nover Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. However, mere \nfamily ties with people in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. Whether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a foreign country pose a \nsecurity risk depends on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the family ties.   \n \nApplicant has strong loyalties to the United States. He and his family came to the \nUnited States for a better life. They succeeded in becoming part of the United States \n\n \n11 \n \n \nculture like many immigrant families before them. He and his family participate in local \nactivities like any other family. He is regarded as loyal, trustworthy, and reliable by those \nthat know and work with him. His neighbors consider him to be a good citizen and \nneighbor. Applicant has established his loyalty to the United States. His country of birth \nand where his family members reside, India, is a partner of the United States in many \ninternational endeavors. While India experiences incidents of terrorism and maintains a \nrelationship with Iran, these facts create only an ordinary risk of vulnerability to \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Applicant's loyalty to the \nUnited States and the position and activities of his family in India make it unlikely that he \nwill have to choose between their interest and the interest of the United States. Overall, \non balance, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has met the burden of mitigating all potential security concerns \narising from his family members in India. Accordingly, I find that Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.l:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn December 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 15, 2010, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 4, 2010. The FORM was \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 3, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nmailed to Applicant, who received it on March 10, 2010. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant provided additional information. The case was assigned to me on April 30, \n2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.j, and \ndenied the remaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He served in the Air Force Reserves from 1985 to \n1989, and was honorably discharged. He is married and his children are grown. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1977 and obtained a computer programming certificate. \n \n \nApplicant experienced periods of unemployment from: October 2007 to \nNovember 2007 and May 2008 to June 2008. He has been employed with his current \nemployer since June 2008.  \n \n \nApplicant provided proof of satisfaction of the judgments listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.u. These judgments were owed to a former landlord. Applicant withheld rent when he \nhad a dispute with the landlord. Applicant stated that he satisfied all of the judgments to \nthis landlord that are listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.y, and 1.z. He did not provide documentary \nproof that these remaining judgments were satisfied.  \n \n \nThe judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($2,874) was based on an unpaid credit card debt. \nThe judgment was obtained in 2005. Applicant closed the account and believed the \ninterest being charged was \u201cobscene\u201d so he did not pay it. Applicant provided a \ndocument to show he was offered a settlement amount of $1,116. He did not provide \nproof that he accepted the offer and is making the required payments.1 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the tax lien debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,008) entered against \nhim in 2008. He acknowledged he would pay it, but needed to investigate it and make \narrangements. He did not provide any other information about what actions he has \ntaken to pay or resolve the debt.2 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($438) is a television account. Applicant acknowledged \nthe account in his response to interrogatories dated June 8, 2009, and stated he would \nattempt to settle the account. He indicated he was required to return the cable boxes \nand had not. No other information was provided regarding this debt.3 \n \n1 Response to FORM.  \n \n2 Item 5. \n \n3 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant did not recognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($123), but stated he would \npay it if it was legitimate. He did not provide any further information on action he took to \ndispute or resolve the debt.4 \n \n \nApplicant disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($372). He stated he never had an \naccount with the creditor. He indicated that he would investigate the debt, but needed \ntime to determine its validity. He believed the debt might be related to identity theft. He \ndid not provide further information regarding his actions to dispute, resolve, or \ndetermine if the debt was due to identity theft.5 \n \n \nApplicant indicated in his response to interrogatories, that he was attempting to \ncontact the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,338) and would attempt to negotiate a \nsettlement. He did not provide other information regarding what actions he took to \nresolve or pay the debt.6 \n \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($460). The debt is listed on two credit \nreports.7 Applicant did not provide documentary proof to show what actions he has \ntaken to dispute the debt. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($17,659) is for a car loan Applicant cosigned for his son. \nHis son acknowledged he defaulted on the loan because he lost his job and intends to \npay the debt when he resumes employment. Because both Applicant and his son are \ncosignatories on the loan, both are responsible for it. Neither has paid the debt and it \nremains unresolved.8 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement on August 12, 2008, he indicated that he had contacted the creditor for \nthe car loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($16,312) and he was making payments. He had fallen \nbehind in his payments. He was then in an accident with the car and it was totaled. His \ninsurance did not cover the loss. He indicated he agreed to pay $215 a month until the \ndebt was paid. He did not provide any documentary proof that he is paying the debt.9 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($254) was a telephone account. Applicant indicated in his \nresponse to interrogatories that he was attempting to negotiate a settlement with the \ncreditor. He also indicated he was contacting the credit bureau. He believed the balance \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Item 6, 7. \n \n8 Item 5; Response to FORM. \n \n9 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nshould be around $100. He did not provide documentary proof of his actions or \npayments.10 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($1,560) is for a school Applicant attended for three \nmonths before terminating the course because he got a job. He indicated that in April \n2008, he made an agreement with the creditor to pay 15% of his pay to satisfy the debt. \nHe indicated that he made three payments. He did not provide proof he made any \npayments or that the debt is resolved.11 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($1,366) is owed for parking tickets. Applicant indicated \nhe paid $300 for parking fines. He believes the remaining fines are owed by his brother \nand his son. His brother purchased the vehicle for which the tickets were issued and his \nson used the vehicle. Applicant indicated he would resolve the issue. He indicated he \nwas entering into a payment arrangement with the creditor and was to begin receiving \nmonthly bills in July 2009. Applicant did not provide proof of the agreements or of any \npayments made. There was no documentary evidence provided to substantiate \nApplicant\u2019s position that he was not responsible for the remaining debt.12 \n \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q ($715 and $338) were for car insurance. \nApplicant had two-year contracts with the companies and cancelled them early. He \nindicated he was negotiating settlements. He did not provide documents to show he has \nresolved the debts.13 \n \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.r ($420 and $145) are payday loans. Applicant \nindicated that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p was dismissed due to a class action lawsuit against \nthe creditor. Applicant did not provide documentary proof of his position. He did not \nprovide proof he has disputed the debt with the credit bureau. Regarding the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.r, he indicated the creditor is no longer in business. He stated he was disputing \nthis debt with the credit bureau, but did not provide documentary proof.14 \n \n \nApplicant disputed the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.s ($527). He acknowledged he had \na dispute with the creditor and they went to small claims court. He indicated he paid the \ncreditor and she agreed to remove the judgment from the record. He sent the creditor a \nletter requesting that she remove the judgment. No additional documents were provided \nto show the judgment was satisfied.15 \n \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 Id. \n \n13 Id. \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Id. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe creditor for the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.t ($2,461) offered to settle the account \nfor 50% of the balance. Applicant is waiting for paperwork. The debt remains \nunresolved.16 \n \n \nApplicant is unaware of the basis for the judgment that was entered against him \nin 1989 and listed in SOR \u00b6 1.v ($20,000). On March 22, 2010, he wrote a letter on to \nthe creditor, but the letter was returned, undelivered. He indicated he is attempting to \ncontact the attorney who handled the case. He believes the debt could be due to \nidentity theft. Applicant did not provide any other information showing his actions to \ndispute or resolve the debt. 17  \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.w ($145) is owed to a probation department. Applicant \nindicated he has never been in jail, but his oldest son is incarcerated. He has not \nprovided information to show he has disputed the debt or contacted the creditor to \nresolve it.18 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x ($1,684) is owed to a city housing authority. Applicant \nbelieves this debt is an error. He indicated that he contacted the creditor and is waiting \nfor someone to contact him. No other information was provided as to what action \nApplicant has taken to resolve or dispute the debt.19 \n \n \nApplicant indicated in his response to interrogatories that he needed time to \nresolve his debts. He stated he had no idea about many of his debts until his clearance \ninvestigation. He believes many of the debts are in error or inaccurate. He has been \npoor all of his life and has never been arrested. He has been working since he was 15 \nyears old. He believes he is a man of character and integrity. He has never succumbed \nto making money illegally.20 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n \n16 Id. \n \n17 Items 5, 9, 10. \n \n18 Items 5, 11. \n \n19 Items 5, 12. \n \n20 Response to FORM.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n7 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered the following two under AG & 19: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has 24 delinquent debts and judgments totaling approximately \n$72,732. Except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.u, the debts are unpaid and unresolved. \nApplicant has been aware of the security concerns regarding his delinquent debts since \nAugust 2008, when he was interviewed by the OPM investigator. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant proved that he satisfied the judgments in SOR \u00b61.a and 1.u. He did not \nprove that he paid or resolved any of the remaining delinquent debts or judgments. He \nwas offered a settlement agreement for the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but did not provide \nproof that he accepted the agreement and is making payments. He disputes many of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe debts, but failed to substantiate his disputes and provide proof of any actions he \nmay have taken. He indicated that he needed time to investigate certain debts. He was \ninterviewed about his delinquent debts in August 2008. He was on notice in June 2009, \nthrough his interrogatories, of the specific debts he needed to address. He was again \nmade aware in December 2009 of the financial considerations security concerns \nthrough the SOR. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent and the delinquent debts and \njudgments remain an ongoing and unresolved concern. I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. There is some evidence that Applicant experienced short periods \nof unemployment. However, he failed to provide enough information to determine the \nlevel of impact his short unemployment periods had on his ability to pay his bills. Those \nperiods of unemployment were beyond his control, but insufficient evidence was \nprovided to conclude he acted responsibly under the circumstances. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) \nonly partially applies. There is no evidence Applicant sought advice from a financial \nadvisor. There is no clear evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being \nresolved or under control. He did not provide evidence that he has made a good-faith \neffort to pay the majority of his delinquent debts and judgments, or attempt to resolve \nthem. Applicant satisfied two judgments. He indicated other judgments were paid, but \ndid not provide proof. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Throughout, he \nclaimed, without corroboration that he disputed many of the delinquent debts and \njudgments, but failed to provide documentation verifying the disputes or actions he was \ntaking to resolve them. I find AG \u00b6 20 (e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military \nreserves. I have considered he experienced periods of unemployment. In August 2008, \nthe Government made him aware of the security concerns related to his delinquent \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndebts. In December 2009, DOHA issued a SOR listing the specific debts of concern. He \nsubsequently provided documentation that he satisfied two judgments and has a \nsettlement offer from one creditor. However, he did not provide documentation to show \nhe paid any of the remaining delinquent debts. He did not provide information that he \nsought credit counseling or established a repayment plan or settlement agreement with \nany of the other creditors. He disputed some debts, but did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show any actions he may have taken to address the disputed debts. \nDespite having notice of the concerns for more than a year, he failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns, indicating a lack of reliability and \ngood judgment. Overall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.t: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.u:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.v-1.z: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.g, 1.j, 1.m, and 1.n. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old network engineer employed by a defense contractor. He finished high school in 1995, and the following year he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served in the Army from November 1996 to December 1999, achieved the grade of E-3, and his service was characterized as honorable. While in the service, he possessed a secret level security clearance. Applicant married his first wife in December 1997, and they were divorced in December 1998. He has had sole custody of his 13-year-old son since his divorce. He married his current wife in June 2008. He and his wife are currently attending college. They have combined college expenses of approximately $4,000 per semester. He expects to receive his associate\u2019s degree in information technology in May 2010. After leaving the Army, Applicant was unemployed and underemployed from December 1999 until September 2001. He has been consistently employed since September 2001.

He mitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 19, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nNovember 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \nMay 21, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations on December 4, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 26, \n2010. DOHA issued the notice of hearing on January 29, 2010, convening a hearing on \nFebruary 17, 2010. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objections. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 6, which were \nadmitted without objection. AE 6 was received post-hearing. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 23, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.g, 1.j, 1.m, and 1.n. He \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old network engineer employed by a defense contractor. \nHe finished high school in 1995, and the following year he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He \nserved in the Army from November 1996 to December 1999, achieved the grade of E-3, \nand his service was characterized as honorable. While in the service, he possessed a \nsecret level security clearance.  \n \nApplicant married his first wife in December 1997, and they were divorced in \nDecember 1998. He has had sole custody of his 13-year-old son since his divorce. He \nmarried his current wife in June 2008. He and his wife are currently attending college. \nThey have combined college expenses of approximately $4,000 per semester. He \nexpects to receive his associate\u2019s degree in information technology in May 2010.  \n \nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant was unemployed and underemployed from \nDecember 1999 until September 2001. He has been consistently employed since \nSeptember 2001. However, he continued to be underemployed until 2006. He submitted \nhis security clearance application in July 2008, and was granted interim access to \nclassified information. In April 2009, he started working for his current employer, a \ngovernment contractor, who is sponsoring his application.  \n \nApplicant attributed his current financial problems to being unemployed and \nunderemployed since he left the Army until sometime in 2006. He was not making \nsufficient money to pay his delinquent debts and his and his son\u2019s day-to-day living \nexpenses. His financial situation improved in 2006; however, he did not start to address \nhis delinquent debts until 2008-2009. He explained he wanted to stabilize his financial \nsituation prior to paying his debts. (Tr. 68) He claimed he attempted to take a debt \n\n \n3 \n \n \nconsolidation loan, but it was not approved. He also claimed he looked into starting a \ndebt consolidation program. He rejected the idea because it did not made sense to him \nto pay for something he could do on his own. Applicant has not participated in any \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 87)  \n \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling approximately $23,000. At his \nhearing, Applicant presented documentary evidence showing he had resolved the \nfollowing debts:  \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a. This debt was paid in February 2010 ($163) (AE 7).  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b. He claimed he disputed this debt telephonically prior to the \nhearing. He disputed it again in writing in March 2010. (AE 7) \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c. He established a payment agreement in September 2009, and has \nmade six consecutive payments. A(E 7)  \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d. He settled and paid this debt for less than the amount owed. (AE \n7)  \n  \n5. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 1.m. These debts were paid in November-\nDecember 2009. (AE 7)  \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant disputed this debt through the credit bureau. (GE 5) He \nclaimed he was told the dispute was resolved in his favor and that he was informed the \ndebt was removed from his credit report. He presented no documentary evidence to \nshow the account was resolved in his favor, or that it was removed from his credit \nreport. \n \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.i. An $11,425 judgment was filed against Applicant in 2007. He \nclaimed this is not his debt, that he was not notified of the judgment proceedings against \nhim, and that he was not aware of the debt until his background interview. He claimed \nhe disputed this debt telephonically in October 2009 and January 2010. He presented \ndocumentary evidence he disputed it again in writing in March 2010. (AE 7) Applicant \nintends to dispute the judgment. He promised to pay the debt if it is his financial \nobligation. \n \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.k. This is a medical debt for an unidentified creditor. The Government \nconceded it would be difficult for Applicant to address the debt without knowing the \nidentity of the creditor. \n \n9. SOR \u00b6 1.l. Applicant claimed he disputed this debt in November 2009. As of \nhis hearing, he had not received a reply. \n \n10. SOR \u00b6 1.n. This debt was paid in February 2010. (AE 7) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation has improved substantially since he started working \nas a network engineer in 2008. His earnings have doubled. His wife works full time and \ntheir combined monthly income is approximately $110,000. His household net monthly \nincome is approximately $6,000. He has monthly expenses of around $3,665, and his \nnet remainder is $2,335. I note, however, that Applicant listed no monthly payments for \nany of his delinquent debts in his personal financial statement. In addition to the debts \nlisted in the SOR, Applicant disclosed he owes $10,000 in deferred student loans and \n$2,600 on the only credit card he carries. Also, his wife crashed her car in 2007, and \nthey purchased a new vehicle in 2009. \n \nApplicant testified he and his wife have a budget and they try to follow it. His plan \nis to pay all his delinquent debts, including the disputed debts if they are his financial \nobligations. Applicant was forthcoming about his past and present financial situation. He \nacknowledged his prior financial mistakes and his failure to resolve his delinquent debts \ndiligently. He expressed remorse for his financial problems and for not being more \nresponsible addressing his debs. With his wife\u2019s assistance, he is now in a better \nfinancial position to address his past debt. He promised to make satisfactory payment \narrangements with all of his creditors sometime in the future. He believes that his recent \nefforts paying his debts show he is trying to be financially responsible. He highlighted \nhis good performance for his employer and that he is considered to be honest, \ntrustworthy, and a valued employee.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s references consider him to be trustworthy, honest, and responsible. \nHe has a strong work ethic and carries himself in a professional manner. He has a \nreputation for knowing and complying with security guidelines and regulations. There is \nno evidence that Applicant has compromised or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d1 Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling approximately $23,000, which \nwere delinquent for a number of years. Applicant resolved nine of the alleged delinquent \ndebts. He disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l. The Government conceded the \ncreditor in the debt alleged under SOR \u00b6 1.k was not properly identified. The remaining \nfour delinquent debts are unresolved. Based on the credit reports, these are Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts, which have been delinquent for many years. His total liability is \napproximately $16,000 in unresolved SOR debt. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nApplicant presented documentary evidence to show that he has settled and paid \nnine of the alleged debts. He disputed the remaining five debts. He started addressing \nhis delinquent debts after submitting his security clearance application when he realized \nthat his bad credit would adversely impact on his eligibility for a clearance.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts from 2006 \nuntil 2008-2009.  \n \nApplicant established some circumstances beyond his control, which contributed \nto his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his period of unemployment and underemployment \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nafter leaving the Army, and being a single parent. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but \ndoes not fully mitigate the financial concerns. He does not receive full mitigating credit \nbecause he did not establish that he acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to \naddress his delinquent debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant has not participated in financial counseling. \nHowever, he demonstrated he has the self-discipline necessary to reduce and resolve \nhis debts. He followed a budget, settled and established payment plans with creditors, \nand substantially reduced his debts. He has also established partial mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 20(d) because he showed good faith2 in the resolution of his SOR debts. He receives \nonly partial credit because he should have been more diligent addressing his debts. \nApplicant properly contested the validity of five debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does apply.  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, there are clear indications that his financial \nproblems are being resolved or are under control. Applicant\u2019s evidence shows he has \nbeen paying consistently on his payment plans. He has a viable plan to resolve his \nfinancial predicament and I believe that he will be able to avoid similar financial \nproblems in the future. Although Applicant should have been more diligent and made \ngreater efforts sooner to resolve his delinquent debts and he still has four unresolved \ndebts, his past behavior and current financial situation do not raise doubt about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Financial considerations concerns are \nmitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant should have been more \naggressive in his efforts to establish payment plans on his delinquent debts. He had \nsufficient income to make greater progress in delinquent debt resolution. These factors \nshow some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. \n \nNotwithstanding, the mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is \nsufficient to warrant granting Applicant\u2019s security clearance. He served honorably in the \nArmy for three years and has worked for government contractors since 2008. On both \noccasions he has access to classified information. There is no evidence he has ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information. He has a \nreputation as a law-abiding citizen and a good father. He is considered to be honest and \ntrustworthy. His financial problems were caused, in part, by factors beyond his control. \nHe has continued his education with a view to improve his financial situation. He has \nworked well for his employer. Moreover, he has taken control of his financial situation, \nand recently has made significant progress in resolving his debts. He has established a \nplan to resolve his financial problems and has taken significant actions to implement his \nplan. He now understands what is required of him to be eligible to possess a security \nclearance. These factors show some responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Ms. Megan Levins, Personal Representative\nApril 27, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), on July 17, 2008.  On November 4, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline ***F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR soon thereafter.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  DOHA\nreceived the request on or about December 3, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on January 19, 2010.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 25,\n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 22, 2010.  The\n\n2\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were received without objection.\nThe Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through C,\nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March 2, 2010.\nThe record closed on February 22, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the\none Subparagraph of the SOR, with explanation.  He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Applicant comes from a long line of military families.  (TR at page 22 line 5 to\npage 23 line 6, and at page 27 line 10 to page 28 line 8.)  He served on active duty with\nthe U.S. Army for four years.  (Id.)  In 2005, the Applicant lost his civilian job, as the\n\u201cFire Alarms and Fire Inspections\u201d business he worked for went out of business.  (TR at\npage 30 lines 1~14).  This caused the Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties.\n1.a.  The Applicant fell behind on his house payments; and as a result, his house\nwas foreclosed upon in 2008.  (TR at page 28 line 19 to page 29 line 25, and at page 30\nline 19 to page 33 line 5).  It is alleged that the Applicant owes $48,000, as the result of\na second mortgage being taken out on the foreclosed house.  This \u201cloan was sold four\ntimes\u201d; and despite his best efforts, the Applicant was unable ascertain who was the\ncreditor.  (TR at page 30 line 19 to page 33 line 5).  Finally, in December of 2009, the\nApplicant was able to contact the creditor.  (TR at page 23 line 6 to page 26 line 3.)  In\nDecember this debt was settled in full for $8,500, to the satisfaction of the creditor, as\nevidenced by correspondence with the creditor.  (Id, and AppX A).  Furthermore, this\ndebt has been removed from the Applicant\u2019s most recent February 2010 credit report.\n(AppX C.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\n\n3\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\n\n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant suffered a foreclosure; and as\na result, owed $48,000 on a second mortgage.\nThese are clearly countered by the Mitigating Conditions found in Subparagraphs\n20(b) and 20 (d).  Under Subparagraph 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@\nFurthermore, Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@\nThrough no fault of his own, the Applicant lost his job, which caused his financial\ndifficulties.  He has now settled the second mortgage debt that was of concern to the\nGovernment.  He has no other past due debts.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept.  Here, he has the unqualified support of one of his colleagues, who has written\na letter on his behalf.  (AppX B.)\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his financial considerations.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation all of the SOR allegations. Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 50 years old. Since February 2005, he has been employed as a long distance truck driver for a trucking company hauling loads under contracts with the 3 Department of Defense. Because of the sensitive nature of the loads, he requires a security clearance. Applicant is a high school graduate and attended college between 1979 and 1981. His marriage in May 1993 ended by divorce in September 1996. Applicant has no dependents and is not obligated to pay support to his ex-wife. (Gx. 1) Applicant has worked as a long distance truck driver for at least 15 years, but he has never before held a security clearance. He currently drives company-owned trucks, but in the past has driven his own tractor-trailer rigs. In 1999, the trucking company for whom he was working told him he had to buy his own tractor trailer to haul their loads. He financed the purchase of a used truck for $30,000. In 2001, he financed the purchase of a used trailer for $20,000.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant two sets of interrogatories  to clarify or augment information about\n1\npotentially disqualifying information in his background. After reviewing the results of the\nbackground investigation and Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nMay 27, 2010\n\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n3\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n Directive at E3.1.17. \n4\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified\ninformation. On October 19, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG)  for financial considerations (Guideline F).\n3\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 5, 2010. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued the same\nday, I convened a hearing in this matter on February 24, 2010. The parties appeared as\nscheduled. The Government presented six exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5), which were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and proffered three exhibits,\nwhich were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - C. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on March 4, 2010. The record closed on March\n15, 2010, when I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which is admitted as Ax.\nD.\nProcedural Issue\nAt the hearing, Applicant disclosed in response to questions from Department\nCounsel that he has not filed or paid his income taxes for at least the past ten years and\nthat the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had recently begun garnishing his pay. (Tr. 74 -\n82, 87 - 90) Whereupon, Department Counsel moved to amend the Statement of\nReasons to conform to the evidence.  Applicant indicated that he understood the reason\n4\nfor the Government\u2019s motion and did not object to it. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s\nmotion (Tr. 91) and the following allegation was added to the SOR as subparagraph 1.g:\n\u201cYou have not filed your federal or state tax returns as required for approximately\nthe past ten years.\u201d\nApplicant admitted to the new allegation (Tr.  91).

In response to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted with explanation all of the SOR allegations. Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nrelevant fact.\nApplicant is 50 years old. Since February 2005, he has been employed as a long\ndistance truck driver for a trucking company hauling loads under contracts with the\n\n3\nDepartment of Defense. Because of the sensitive nature of the loads, he requires a\nsecurity clearance. Applicant is a high school graduate and attended college between\n1979 and 1981. His marriage in May 1993 ended by divorce in September 1996.\nApplicant has no dependents and is not obligated to pay support to his ex-wife. (Gx. 1)\nApplicant has worked as a long distance truck driver for at least 15 years, but he\nhas never before held a security clearance. He currently drives company-owned trucks,\nbut in the past has driven his own tractor-trailer rigs. In 1999, the trucking company for\nwhom he was working told him he had to buy his own tractor trailer to haul their loads.\nHe financed the purchase of a used truck for $30,000. In 2001, he financed the\npurchase of a used trailer for $20,000. Shortly thereafter, when the trucking company\nwent out of business because the owner retired, Applicant went to work for a trucking\ncompany located in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. The owner of that\ncompany (his boss) offered to sell a 2003 model used truck in exchange for Applicant\u2019s\n1997 model truck and $8,000. Applicant agreed and turned over his truck to the owner.\nHe also financed the purchase of a $40,000 trailer to use with the new truck. (Gx. 2; Tr.\n34 - 37, 42 - 54)\nApplicant\u2019s understanding was that this transaction would satisfy the loan on the\nolder truck and trailer he traded, with the $8,000 paid making up the difference in loan\nvalues. He agreed to the transaction verbally, but never received the newer truck.\nAvailable information suggests that his boss was engaged in a series of fraudulent\ntransactions with Applicant and other drivers working for that company. (Ax. A; Ax. B) In\nFebruary 2003, after several months waiting for a truck to drive, Applicant financed the\npurchase of another truck for about $52,000 so he could resume earning a living.\nHowever, that truck developed significant mechanical difficulties and Applicant\nvoluntarily returned it to the bank. All of Applicant\u2019s purchases, except for the fraudulent\ntransaction with his old boss, were finances through the bank identified in SOR 1.a.\nApplicant still owes that bank about $150,000 with interest and penalties. (Gx. 2; Tr. 63)\nHe is unable to repay this debt.\nApplicant and other employees contacted local law enforcement in the Gulf\nCoast area to complain about their experience with the trucking company that\ndefrauded them. Applicant also explored possible civil action through telephone\nconversations with lawyers whose names he does not recall. Any law enforcement or\ncourt records associated with this matter were lost in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina. (Tr.\n55- 57)\nWhile Applicant was waiting for the newer truck that was never delivered, he\nused two credit cards to help pay his living expenses. Those accounts have been\ndelinquent (SOR 1.c and 1.e) for at least five years. As of the hearing, Applicant had not\npaid or otherwise resolved those debts.\nIn the past five years, two other delinquent debts have been attributed to\nApplicant. One was for an unpaid $153 utility bill incurred when Applicant moved in\n2007. (SOR 1.b) He paid that debt in full in February 2010. (Ax. C) The other debt is a\n$426 bill for propane gas to heat a home he occupied in 2001. (SOR 1.d) When he\nmoved in to that home, the gas tank was almost empty. When he vacated the home, he\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n4\nleft the same amount of gas as when he moved in. However, the landlord filled the tank\nafter Applicant moved out and charged Applicant for the gas. (Gx. 2) The debt alleged in\nSOR 1.e is a duplicate of the debt alleged at SOR 1.d. SOR 1.e is resolved for the\nApplicant.\nApplicant has not filed either his state or federal tax returns as required for at\nleast the past ten years. He does not know when his pay is due to be garnished or how\nmuch will be diverted. For most of the past ten years, Applicant has claimed more\nexemptions from withholding of taxes from his pay so he would receive as much of his\npay each week as possible. However, he estimates that he may owe as much as\n$14,000 to the IRS.\nApplicant is able to meet all of his current monthly obligations and has a positive\ncash flow of $625 remaining each month. However, he is not making any payments on\nany of his past due obligations. \nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n6\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n7\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR 1.a - 1.f, and the information disclosed at hearing was sufficient to support the\nadditional allegation at SOR 1.g; that is, that Applicant owed $152,291 for six delinquent\ndebts, and that he has not filed federal or state tax returns for at least 10 years and may\nowe as much as $14,000 in unpaid taxes. However, one of the debts alleged (SOR 1.f)\nis a duplicate of another (SOR 1.e), and Applicant has paid one of the remaining debts\n(SOR 1.b). Nonetheless, he is still obligated to repay as much as $150,000 for financed\npurchases of two trucks and trailers (SOR 1.a), and he still owes almost $1,300 for two\ndelinquent credit card accounts (SOR 1.c and 1.d). Finally, information shows that\nApplicant owes about $426 for a disputed propane gas bill (SOR 1.e)  Accordingly, the\nrecord requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts), AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax\nreturns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same). As to AG \u00b6 19(a), it should be\nemphasized that Applicant is willing to pay his debts but is unable to do so.\n\n6\nIn response to the SOR and at hearing, Applicant established that the debt at\nSOR 1.a arose largely from circumstances beyond his control. Despite the absence of\ncorroborating documents lost during Hurricane Katrina, his account of his experiences\nwith a trucking company owner who defrauded him out of a new truck was credible. It\nwas also supported by two letters he submitted. Applicant\u2019s credit card debts were\nincurred while he was unable to work because he had no truck. When he subsequently\nbought a truck and trailer, he experienced numerous mechanical problems that further\nhindered his ability to haul loads and earn income. These facts require consideration of\nthe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Further, the record shows that,\nalthough Applicant used poor judgment in agreeing to the deal with his boss, there was\nlittle he could do to resolve the matter. Without a truck, he could not work. The next\ntruck he owned broke down and produced more debt. It is unlikely Applicant will ever\nresolve this debt because his profession simply does not pay enough. AG \u00b6 20(b)\napplies to SOR 1.a.\nAs to his delinquent credit card accounts (SOR 1.c and 1.d), these can also be\nattributed to the fact that he was without a truck for the better part of two years.\nHowever, since he has been working for his current employer, it appears he has had\nenough money remaining after expenses to make some payments on both accounts.\nBecause he has not paid or otherwise acted to resolve these debts, none of the AG \u00b6\n20 mitigating conditions apply. \nAs to his disputed propane gas bill (SOR 1.e), Applicant\u2019s explanation was\nplausible. Such circumstances are hardly unusual, and more likely to occur where, as\nhere, an individual moves frequently to pursue job opportunities. Available information\nrequires consideration of AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute\nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue). Despite the lack of documentation, I found Applicant to be\ncredible regarding this issue, and I resolve SOR 1.e in his favor.\nApplicant had no explanation for why he has not filed his federal or state tax\nreturns for the past decade. He testified that his conduct \u201cwas just laziness\u201d (Tr. 88) As\nof the hearing, he anticipated his pay being garnished, thus reducing his positive cash\nflow and further hindering his ability to pay his debts. He has not mitigated the security\nconcerns about his unpaid taxes alleged in SOR 1.g.\nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies only to the debt at SOR\n1.b, which Applicant paid before the hearing. However, other than already discussed,\nApplicant has not established the applicability of this mitigating condition or any others\nlisted under AG \u00b6 20. Even though much of Applicant\u2019s remaining debt was not his fault,\nthe totality of information about his finances, including his deliberate failure to file his\ntaxes over a prolonged period, presents an unacceptable risk that he would resort to\n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n9\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n7\nimproper or illegal conduct to obtain money to pay his debts. I conclude that the security\nconcerns about his unpaid debt are not mitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Available information shows that\nApplicant, 50 years old, has been trying to make an honest living as a truck driver. He\nhas experienced unforeseen circumstances that have resulted in financial problems that\nare beyond his ability to resolve. They are also, in part, beyond his willingness to\nresolve. He has been able to pay his smaller debts for at least five years but he has not\ndone so. At the same time, he has deliberately avoided his tax-paying obligations and\nhas deliberately tried to minimize the taxes withheld from his pay. His poor decision-\nmaking far outweighs the bad luck he has experienced. Thus, a fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s past and current\n9\ncircumstances shows he has not addressed satisfactorily the Government\u2019s doubts\nabout his ability and willingness to protect the Government\u2019s interests as his own.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved for the Government.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b, 1.e, 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.

On June 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 14, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nDOHA received the request and assigned the case to me on September 18, 2009. On\nOctober 5, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for October\n27, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted four\nexhibits (GE) 1-4, without objection. Applicant presented 13 exhibits (AE) A-M, without\nobjection. He testified on his own behalf. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open\nDecember 23, 2009\n\n2\nuntil November 10, 2009. Applicant submitted a packet of receipts which was marked\nAE N and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received\non November 5, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.l and 2.a of the SOR. He admitted the allegation in \u00b6 2.b of the SOR. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school and obtained an undergraduate degree in 1973. Applicant is married and\nhas four children. He has worked for his current employer since June 2008.\nIn late 2004, Applicant was unemployed for eight months. He obtained several\ncontract jobs that were sporadic. His income was greatly reduced and he could not pay\nall his bills. Applicant used his retirement savings to help pay his bills as long as he\ncould. He relocated to find work. His wife became ill in 2006 and incurred many medical\nbills. She does not work outside the home (Tr. 11). She is now on disability. Prior to his\nunemployment, Applicant earned $72,000 a year and did not have any financial\ndifficulties (Tr. 36).\nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts, including medical accounts. The\napproximate total for Applicant\u2019s debts is $52,000 (GE 3). The current status of\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts is described below.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a collection account in the amount of $4,097.\nApplicant settled the account for $2,900. His final payment is in December 2009 (AE A).\nApplicant is in repayment status for the alleged debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $10,181.\nHe pays $488 monthly on the debt. The balance is $3,439 (AE B). \nApplicant pays $257 monthly on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The balance\nowed is $6,753. This amount may be reduced in the next months by the credit union (Tr.\n25).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $4,555 is a student loan that he cosigned for\nhis son. He is paying $100 a month on the loan (AE D). \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $19,733 is the result of a voluntary\nrepossession. Applicant could not pay the $539 a month car loan when he lost his job in\n2004 (Tr. 27). He had made payment on the car for approximately 18 months before he\nreturned the vehicle to the dealer. The automobile was resold by the dealership.\nApplicant has formally disputed the amount. He is waiting an accurate accounting of any\nbalance that might be due (AE N). \n\n3\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $326 was settled and paid (Tr.30).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is for $240. This is a credit card account.\nApplicant paid the account in full (AE F).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a phone account for $651. Applicant paid the\naccount (AE N).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is a medical bill for $145. This is paid (AE I). \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j is for another medical bill that was paid in full in the\namount of $130 (AE J). \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k for $4,200 is paid. This represented money owed\nto a former landlord (AE K).\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l refers to the voluntary repossession in allegation 1.\ne.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $8,145 (GE 2). He is current\nwith his monthly expenses. His net monthly remainder is approximately $439. He has a\nsavings account (GE 2). He has no credit cards. He began repayment of his debts as\nsoon as he obtained full-time employment. He has also been paying medical bills that\nare not covered by any insurance for his wife (Tr. 40). His son requires medical care for\na health issue. This has required Applicant to pay many bills over a sustained period\n(AE N).\nWhen Applicant completed his July 16, 2008 security clearance application, he\nread question 27 concerning any property repossessions and answered \u201cNo.\u201d He\nexplained that since he had made payments on his car until his unemployment forced\nhim to return the vehicle voluntarily to the dealership, he did not consider that he had\nany property \u201crepossessed.\u201d He was credible in his explanation (Tr. 33). In that\napplication, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 28a concerning financial delinquencies in the\nlast seven years over 180 days, and \u201cNo\u201d to question 28b concerning financial\ndelinquencies over 90 days (GE 1). Applicant knew he had outstanding debts, but did\nnot have any financial information with him and was unclear as to the exact situation.\nHe now realizes that he should have answered that question in the affirmative (Tr. 34). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on many accounts for a\nperiod. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\nacknowledged that he had many things happen in 2004 that caused his financial\ndifficulties. He had also provided for his family and was responsible. This mitigating\ncondition applies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Before 2004, Applicant\ndid not have financial difficulties. When he lost his job and could not find work for almost\neight months, he incurred delinquent debts. He also had his wife\u2019s illness and his son\u2019s\nhealth problems which required a substantial outlay of money. When he found\nemployment, he was receiving a lower salary. He did not find a permanent position until\n2008. At that point, he began repaying his delinquent debts. He also had to turn in his\nvehicle after he had made payments for almost 18 months. The car was sold, but he\nhas not been given credit for the sale which would reduce the amount of debt reported\non his credit card. He is disputing the amount and attempting to obtain an accurate\namount that he will pay. Applicant has acted responsibly in paying his accounts under\nthe circumstances.  This mitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He has\nresolved his debts and is not shirking payment on the voluntary car repossession. He\ndisputed the amount and is actively working on resolving the issue. He entered into\nrepayment status and has been consistent so far. His efforts are sufficient to carry his\nburden in this case. I conclude these mitigating conditions apply.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d As discussed above, the $19,000 for his\nvehicle is in formal dispute. He provided documentation for this assertion. I conclude\nthis mitigating condition applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2008 security application, he did not\nanswer \u201cyes\u201d to questions 27 or 28. He denied the allegation concerning a falsification\nof his answers. At the hearing, he stated that he answered the questions to the best of\nhis ability and did not know realize at the time the information was not accurate. He\nincorrectly answered the questions but he did not intentionally falsify his application. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the Government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in\nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). Thus, AG \u00b6 16(a) does not\napply in this case. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant has worked all his life. He supported his\nfamily. His wife and son have medical concerns. He never had financial difficulties\nbefore his unemployment in 2004. He acted responsibly in handling the delinquent\ndebts when he obtained permanent employment. He has resolved the delinquent debts\nthrough his repayment plan. He answered questions 27 and 28 concerning financial\ndelinquencies in the last 7 years to the best of his ability. He did not intentionally falsify\nhis SF 86.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.l:\nFOR Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant admitted with explanation each of these allegations. In addition to the facts established through his admissions, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 45 years old and is seeking a security clearance in connection with his employment as an engineer for a large defense contractor. He has held that position since April 2008. He and his wife have been married since October 1995. They have three children (ages 8, 6, and 4). Applicant\u2019s wife is a stay-at-home mom who home- schools their children, but brings in no additional income. In early 2008, their middle child was diagnosed with autism. Notwithstanding the fact the child is high functioning, Applicant and his wife have had to provide (often at their own expense) physical therapy, speech therapy, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, and other medically related services from neurologists and pediatricians. From about May 2008 through June 2009, he paid about $800 each month for autism treatment services. In June 2009, he received a grant that now offsets by about $400 Applicant\u2019s monthly medical expenses. 3 Applicant was steadily employed from March 1998 until May 2007, when he was laid off.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  to obtain clarification of, and/or additional\n1\ninformation about potentially disqualifying information in his background. After reviewing\nthe results of the background investigation, including Applicant\u2019s response to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines take precedence over the guidelines listed\nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n - 1.u erroneously alleged the debts remained as of August 14, 2009. As noted by Applicant in\n4\nhis response to the SOR, and by Department Counsel at hearing (Tr. 8 - 9), the date listed was a\ntypographical error. Accordingly, the parties agreed that the SOR should be amended to indicate that the\ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n - 1.u were unpaid as of April 14, 2009.\n2\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow him access to\n2\nclassified information. On April 22, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if established, raise security concerns addressed\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nOn May 19, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on July 24, 2009, and I convened a hearing on August 27,\n2009. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits,\nwhich were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 4. Applicant\ntestified but presented no documents. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on\nSeptember 4, 2009. The record remained open after the hearing to give Applicant time\nto submit additional relevant information. On September 16, 2009, I received Applicant\u2019s\npost-hearing submission. It has been admitted into the record without objection as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax.) A.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged that Applicant owes approximately\n$50,764 for 24 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.x) that, as of April 14, 2009,  remained\n4\nunpaid. Applicant admitted with explanation each of these allegations. In addition to the\nfacts established through his admissions, I have made the following findings of relevant\nfact.\nApplicant is 45 years old and is seeking a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment as an engineer for a large defense contractor. He has held that position\nsince April 2008. He and his wife have been married since October 1995. They have\nthree children (ages 8, 6, and 4). Applicant\u2019s wife is a stay-at-home mom who home-\nschools their children, but brings in no additional income. In early 2008, their middle\nchild was diagnosed with autism. Notwithstanding the fact the child is high functioning,\nApplicant and his wife have had to provide (often at their own expense) physical\ntherapy, speech therapy, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, and other medically\nrelated services from neurologists and pediatricians. From about May 2008 through\nJune 2009, he paid about $800 each month for autism treatment services. In June\n2009, he received a grant that now offsets by about $400 Applicant\u2019s monthly medical\nexpenses.\n\n3\nApplicant was steadily employed from March 1998 until May 2007, when he was\nlaid off. He supported his family through unemployment benefits and whatever he could\nearn as a self-employed network and server engineer. After he was laid off, Applicant\nhad no health insurance until he began his current job, which added to his debts. Even\nwith the health benefits through his current employer, he incurred additional medical\nexpenses of about $3,000 when his wife suffered a miscarriage in October 2008. (Gx.\n2). The day he began work with his current employer, Applicant was in a car accident in\nwhich his car was totaled, and which caused him to incur additional costs to replace his\nability to get to work. During Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment and under-\nemployment, Applicant\u2019s father died. His mother died about two weeks before the\nhearing. Applicant testified that neither event had much financial impact on him, but that\nthe only proceeds available to him from their estate will be the sale of their home,\nvalued at about $36,000. (Tr. 15, 23, 31 - 33, 52 - 53)\nAfter Applicant was laid off, he and his wife used credit cards to offset their loss\nof income. They were also unable to stay current on payments to many of their credit\ncard accounts, which already had balances on them when he became unemployed.\nAvailable information shows that he owes approximately $33,492 for six delinquent\npersonal credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.I, 1.t, 1.w). Applicant is paying $125\nmonthly to the SOR \u00b6 1.f debt of $2,375. Otherwise, his credit card debts have not been\npaid or otherwise resolved. He also owes approximately $15,317 for 10 other retail\ncredit accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.j - 1.n, 1.s, 1.u, 1.x). These debts have not been\npaid or otherwise resolved. Applicant disputes that he owes $530 for unpaid rent as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He asserted that he gave sufficient notice to break the month-to-\nmonth lease of his residence in 2002. This debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 35 - 37) A\n$208 delinquent electrical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b arose when Applicant moved into his\ncurrent residence in 2005. It remains unpaid, but Applicant testified he has been current\non all of his utilities while in that residence. (Tr. 35)\nFive of the listed debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.o, 1.p - 1.r, 1.v) are unpaid medical bills\ntotaling $1,217. He testified that he has paid the four debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.o, 1.p, 1.r)\nthat were less than $100 each. His unpaid medical bills arose when he needed care for\nhis family but did not have medical coverage while he was unemployed. Aside from the\ndelinquent medical bills listed in the SOR, Applicant testified that he previously paid\nbetween $2,000 and $2,500 in medical bills. (Tr. 27 - 29)\nWhile Applicant was unemployed, he was unable to pay his rent as required. He\nmanaged to pay on time until October 2007, and eventually accrued a $5,000\narrearage, which he has been repaying by adding $400 to his rent payments each\nmonth since he was hired in April 2008. Applicant finished those payments in August\n2009. He has also repaid several smaller unpaid medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.o, 1.p,\nand 1.r; Tr. 35, 41 - 42)\nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in January 2009, he\nsubmitted a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) that showed he had only about $135\nremaining each month after expenses, which included $1,900 in debt and back rent\nrepayments. He is now receiving about $400 each month to offset the cost of treating\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n4\nhis autistic child, and an additional $400 each month, previously paid for back rent, is\nnow available for debt repayment. (Gx. 2) \nApplicant has not consulted formally with a financial counselor. He has not\nsought professional advice about filing bankruptcy or taking other corrective measures.\n(Tr. 33 - 34) Applicant has not incurred any additional debt since he has been\nemployed. The only credit card he now has was issued to him by his employer for work-\nrelated expenses. (Tr. 33)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18, Guideline F (financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must prove\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. \n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nIf the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n7\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in\nfavor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegation in SOR\n\u00b6 1.a - 1.x; that is, that Applicant accrued almost $50,000 in delinquent personal debt\nthrough April 2008. Applicant is making payments on one credit card debt, and he has\npaid some of the smaller medical debts attributable to him. Further, he disputes a debt\nfor unpaid rent from 2002. However, those debts account for only 2% of the total debt\nhe owes. Applicant did not submit any information to show that he has paid or resolved\nany other of his debts, which have been delinquent for up to two years. I conclude the\nrecord supports those allegations and requires application of the disqualifying conditions\nlisted at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history\nof not meeting financial obligations).\nBy contrast, available information shows that Applicant, the sole income earner\nfor his family, was either unemployed or under-employed for a year before he was hired\nby his current employer in April 2008. His loss of income resulted in several delinquent\ndebts, caused him to fall behind on his rent, and kept him from staying current on\nwhatever debts he already had when he was laid off. Earlier in 2008, one of his children\nwas diagnosed with autism, which has resulted in additional expenses despite having\nhealth coverage through work. After he was hired by his current employer, Applicant\nbegan repaying $5,000 in  past due rent, a process he completed before the hearing.\n\n6\nHe has also paid smaller debts as his income allows. His current finances reflect that he\nhas not incurred any new debts, and that, thanks to an assistive grant for the treatment\nof his autistic child, he has at least $500 remaining after expenses, which include\nongoing repayments of past due debts. \nAvailable information requires application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\n20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances); AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control); and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nThe ongoing presence of significant of unpaid delinquent debt does not\nautomatically mean Applicant should be disqualified. This amount of debt certainly\nraises the possibility that Applicant could resort to illegal means to get money to pay his\ndebts. However, the analysis here must also consider, regardless of the amount,\nApplicant\u2019s response to his adverse financial circumstances and his overall approach to\nmoney management. Applicant established that he has been paying what he can since\nhis income returned. His ability to repay his debts has been hampered by expenses\narising from his wife\u2019s miscarriage, a car accident, which totaled his car, and medical\nexpenses for his autistic child. Available information also shows that he has a positive\nmonthly cashflow that will enable him to continue making payments. On balance, I\nconclude that the security concerns about his unpaid debt are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 45 years old and\npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult. Indeed, he is a dedicated father and\nhusband, who is doing what he can to overcome unforeseen financial and personal\nsetbacks. He knows he must repay a critical mass of personal debt. His first priority was\nto repay $5,000 in back rent so he could keep his family in the home they have\noccupied since 2005. Applicant was been candid and forthcoming about his finances in\nhis application for clearance, and in his response to DOHA interrogatories. There has\nbeen no financial or other misconduct on his part, and his difficulties have been limited\nto a two year period of unemployment and subsequent recovery. Applicant\u2019s testimony\nat the hearing was likewise straightforward. As for documentation of his actions to repair\nhis finances, the resolution of his past due rent in the year before the hearing supports\nhis claimed intent to satisfy his debts now that he is again employed. Available\ninformation about his income and expenses shows that much of his monthly expenses\nhas been directed at debt payments. His continued employment, actions to date, and\npositive cashflow make it likely that he will continue to resolve his debts and that he will\nnot incur new unpayable debts. A fair and commonsense evaluation of this record\n\n7\nshows that the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s credit history are mitigated, and\nhis finances do not put him at risk of acting contrary to the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.x:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest for\nApplicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 53 years old, is an interpreter and translator. She was born in France, but received Italian citizenship by virtue of her parents\u2019 citizenship. Her parents currently live in Italy (GE 1, 2; Tr. 24). She has had strong attachments to the United States since childhood. Her father aided the British Army during World War II by gathering information from Italian locals regarding enemy weapon caches. He worked for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was a diplomat in the United States in the 1960s. His contributions were recognized through a U.S. congressional resolution in the early 1980s. Applicant lived and attended school in the United States as a child when her father was stationed in the United States. Another relative, in her grandparents\u2019 generation, was a war hero who fought against Mussolini during World War II (GE 2; Tr. 17-19). In 1982, Applicant earned the equivalent of a Bachelor\u2019s degree in interpreting and translating at an Italian university (Tr. 29-30).

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), which she signed on September 7, 2007. After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \nOn June 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nNovember 18, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nunder Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \nApplicant received the SOR on July 20, 2009. She signed her notarized Answer on July \n21, 2009, in which she admitted to all the allegations in the Statement of Reasons. She \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 31, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on the same day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 5, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 27, 2009. During the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits, which were marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified and offered \none exhibit, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which also was admitted without objection. I held \nthe record open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation, which was timely \nreceived and forwarded without objection by Department Counsel. Applicant's three \nadditional documents are admitted as AE B through D. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on November 4, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 53 years old, is an interpreter and translator. She was born in France, \nbut received Italian citizenship by virtue of her parents\u2019 citizenship. Her parents currently \nlive in Italy (GE 1, 2; Tr. 24). She has had strong attachments to the United States since \nchildhood. Her father aided the British Army during World War II by gathering \ninformation from Italian locals regarding enemy weapon caches. He worked for the \nItalian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was a diplomat in the United States in the 1960s. \nHis contributions were recognized through a U.S. congressional resolution in the early \n1980s. Applicant lived and attended school in the United States as a child when her \nfather was stationed in the United States. Another relative, in her grandparents\u2019 \ngeneration, was a war hero who fought against Mussolini during World War II (GE 2; Tr. \n17-19). \n \nIn 1982, Applicant earned the equivalent of a Bachelor\u2019s degree in interpreting \nand translating at an Italian university (Tr. 29-30). She was employed at the U.S. \nembassy in Italy from approximately 1982 until 1994 (AE A). Applicant was certified by a \nU.S. national translators\u2019 association in 1997 (Tr. 31). She worked as a staff assistant \nfor an international banking agency from 1997 to 2001 (GE 2). She then worked as a \nfreelance translator and interpreter for U.S. agencies. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed \nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in \nwhich an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3\n                                                \n \nFrom 1985 to 1993, Applicant was married to an Italian citizen. She has one 21-\nyear-old son from this marriage. She came to the United States in 1994, at the age of \n38. She married a U.S. citizen at that time, and they divorced in 1999. Applicant has \nbeen married to her current husband, a U.S. citizen, since 2006. Her son is currently a \ndual citizen; he was solely an Italian citizen until December 2008, when he attained U.S. \ncitizenship. He attends college in the United States (GE 1, 2; Tr. 24-29, 44-46).  \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in December 2003, and received her U.S. \npassport in January 2005. As of the date of the hearing, she also held a valid Italian \npassport, which was issued in June 2003 and will expire in June 2013.3 She noted in \nher Interrogatory response that she possesses the passport because she holds Italian \ncitizenship (GE 1, 2).  \n \n \nSince becoming a United States citizen, Applicant has traveled to Italy once or \ntwice per year (GE 1; Tr. 35, 47). She uses her Italian passport when traveling \noverseas because the airport lines are shorter for citizens of the European Union than \nfor citizens of other countries (Tr. 35). Applicant is certain she used her Italian passport \nto enter Italy (Tr. 37). However, she was uncertain which other countries she entered \nor exited using her Italian passport. She traveled in 2007 to the United Kingdom (U.K.) \n(GE 2), but was unsure if she used her Italian or U.S. passport for that trip. In 2006, \nshe visited Germany and the Czech Republic. She does not think she needed a \npassport to enter Germany, but may have used her Italian passport to enter the Czech \nRepublic on that trip. (Tr. 35-37).  \n \nApplicant's statements in her Interrogatory response of 2008 were more certain: \nshe stated that she traveled to the U.K., Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic using \nher Italian passport (GE 2; Tr. 35). She submitted a copy of her Italian passport, but the \ncountry stamps are barely legible (AE B). It shows at least two trips: one is an entry \ninto the United States in August 2003, before she attained U.S. citizenship. The other \nentry appears to be dated August 2004, but the country cannot be deciphered. In her \npost-hearing submission, Applicant states she is \u201cpretty sure\u201d she used her U.S. \npassport to enter the Czech Republic, but the stamp is faded (GE 2; Tr. 36).  \n \nApplicant's U.S. passport shows multiple trips abroad from 2005 through 2009. \nMost stamps indicate entry into the United States. The legible foreign stamps indicate \n(1) entry or exit from Germany in July 2006; (2) entry or exit from Italy in November \n2007; (3) entry or exit from Italy in September 2008; and (4) entry or exit from Germany \nin March 2009. (AE C). \n \n \nThe DOHA interrogatory Applicant received in December 2008 asked if she is \nwilling to surrender, destroy or invalidate her Italian passport. It also provided directions \non how to surrender her foreign passport to a cognizant security officer, such as a \n \n3 Applicant's foreign passport is a European Union passport; however, it will be identified in this decision \nas an Italian passport to ensure clarity as to the specific European country involved. \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \ncompany Facility Security Officer (FSO), and how to document these actions. Applicant \nresponded that she was not willing to do so because, \u201cdue to the extremely good \nrelations between Italy & United States, I see no reason for destroying, surrendering or \ninvalidating passport.\u201d (GE 2). At the hearing, she again testified that she is not willing \nto surrender, destroy or invalidate it, and reiterated that Italy and the United States \nhave good relations (GE 2; Tr. 38, 40-41). Appellant also testified that she is not willing \nto renounce her Italian citizenship (Tr. 40). \n \n \nApplicant voted once in an Italian election in 2005. In her Interrogatory \nresponse, she noted that she voted because \u201cit is legal.\u201d She testified at hearing that \nshe did so because the Italian embassy now offers the option of voting by mail. (GE 2; \nTr. 41-42). Other elections have been held since 2005, but she has not voted because \nshe understood that it would be an issue for her security clearance processing (Tr. 42). \nShe has no intent to vote in future Italian elections. Applicant also holds an Italian \ndriver\u2019s license (Tr. 47). As of December 2008, she had a bank account in Italy valued \nat approximately $900. Applicant does not receive income from this account, and she \ndoes not own property in Italy. (GE 2; Tr. 46). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed when a case can be so measured, as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.  \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it falls to \nApplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, Applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.6 A \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that \nApplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the \nnational interest as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information in favor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern involving foreign preference arises  \n \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. (AG \u00b6 9) \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10, the following disqualifying condition is relevant: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport;\u2026 (7) voting in a foreign election\u2026 \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Italy and the United States. Dual citizenship, in and of \nitself, is not disqualifying;8 nor is Applicant\u2019s acquisition of an Italian passport in 2003, \nbefore she became a U.S. citizen. However, conduct that constitutes an exercise of \nforeign citizenship, after becoming a U.S. citizen, is disqualifying. Applicant continues \nto exercise the right of an Italian citizen by possessing a valid foreign passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 2003. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant also exercised her rights as an Italian citizen by voting in the Italian \npresidential election of 2005. She has no intent to do so in the future, a decision that is \nbased on the effect it could have on her security clearance eligibility. Applicant's vote in \na foreign election occurred after she became a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 10(a)(7) applies.  \n \nI considered the following relevant mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11: \n \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n8 ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct 17, 2000). \n \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a United States citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor;  \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant travels to Italy several times per year. She uses her foreign passport \nduring these trips to enter and/or exit Italy because of the convenience of using the \nshorter lines reserved for European Union citizens. The Appeal Board has held that \npersonal convenience does not constitute a mitigating factor when evaluating the \nsecurity significance of use of a foreign passport.9 Applicant\u2019s exercise of her Italian \ncitizenship by using her foreign passport occurred numerous times since she attained \nU.S. citizenship in 2003. AG \u00b6 11(c) cannot be applied.  \n \n \nApplicant was on notice that her valid foreign passport represented a security \nconcern from at least December 2008, when she received the DOHA Interrogatory. It \nindicated the accepted methods that she could use to render her foreign passport \nunusable: destruction, invalidation, or surrender to a cognizant security authority. \nApplicant declined to exercise any of the options at that time. She reiterated at the \nhearing that she would not do so. AG \u00b6 11(e) does not apply.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n9 ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n\n \n \n7\n \n \nDual citizenship that is passively acquired through birth in a foreign country or \nan applicant's parents\u2019 citizenship is not disqualifying under the Department of Defense \nregulation that governs security clearance adjudications. However, if a dual citizen \nholds a passport issued by a foreign country, and also wishes to obtain a security \nclearance, then a security concern arises and further inquiry is required (see AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(1)). In such situations, the concern can be mitigated if the foreign passport is \ndestroyed, invalidated or surrendered to a cognizant security authority. Here, \nApplicant\u2018s Italian citizenship, which arose passively through her parents\u2019 citizenship, is \nnot the security concern, but her desire to both possess a valid foreign passport and a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant indicated when she answered the interrogatories, and \nagain at the hearing, that she was unwilling to destroy, invalidate or surrender her \nforeign passport. \n \n \nFinally, it should be noted that Applicant's loyalty to the United States is not at \nissue. The Directive is clear: a security clearance determination is not a determination \nas to an applicant's loyalty (see Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u00a77). \nApplicant credibly testified to her loyalty to the United States, and her employment at a \nUnited States embassy for more than a decade without incident supports her \nstatement. However, the relevant guideline in this case calls for certain steps to be \ntaken to resolve the security concern. Applicant declined to do so, and therefore, she \ncannot be granted a security clearance.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.c. \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant timely submitted AE L through AE DD, which \nwere received without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 3, \n2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nAt the onset of the hearing, Department Counsel stated the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.g. and 1.h. had been paid or resolved as evidenced by \nApplicant\u2019s documentation. Tr. 13-15, AE A - AE E. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., and 1.f.; and denied 1.c., 1.d., 1.g., \nand 1.h. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old integrated logistics manager, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since August 2008. Tr. 17, 25, She previously held \na secret security clearance while in the U.S. Army, discussed infra. She does not \ncurrently have a clearance, and seeks a secret security clearance as a condition of \nher employment. Tr. 26-28.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1989. Tr. 20-21. She served in \nthe U.S. Army from October 1996 to November 2002, and was honorably discharged \nas a Specialist 4 (pay grade E-4). While in the Army, she successfully held a secret \nclearance during her entire enlistment, and also during a brief period of employment \nas a Department of the Army civilian employee from July 2003 to September 2003. Tr. \n18, 26-28, AE H, AE I, AE J. Applicant has earned 134 college credit hours and has \none course to complete before earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Professional \nAeronautics. She also attended a vocational school from June 2005 to September \n2005 to learn software programming. Tr. 22-24, 30, GE 1.  \n \nApplicant has never been married, and has a 17-year-old son for whom she \nhas custody of and provides for his sole support. Tr. 18, 21, GE 1. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her July 2008 e-QIP, her November 2008 and August 2008 \ncredit reports, her September 2008 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Personal \nSubject Interview, and April 1992 and March 2007 judgment and lien filings. GE 1 \u2013 6. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified eight separate line items, which included three liens, \nand five collection accounts approximating $44,803. (Debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d. \nare duplicates.) Tr. 13. \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to an overpayment and recoupment \nthat occurred in the Army, and two periods of unemployment following her discharge \nfrom the Army. It was not until she secured her present job that she was able to earn \nsufficient income to support herself and her family. Tr. 32-38. \n \nSince her SOR was issued, Applicant has paid off or resolved all debts alleged \nin her SOR. As noted at the onset of the hearing, Department Counsel stated the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.g. and 1.h. have been paid or resolved as \nevidenced by Applicant\u2019s documentation.  AE A - AE E. After her hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted documentation that she took out a loan from her 401k to pay off the $1,163 \ncable bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. AE L \u2013 AE M. She also submitted additional \ndocumentation that she had begun repayment and was current on her student loans, \nwhich were alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.f. The respective amounts were $16,348 and \n$23,644, which comprised the majority of overall debt alleged. Applicant set up a \nrepayment plan at the rate of $275 per month through direct debit beginning in March \n2009. AE C, AE O \u2013 AE V. \n \nAdditionally, after her hearing she provided evidence of having sought financial \ncounseling and provided updates of her progress in attaining financial stability. She \nalso included a budget reflecting that she is living within her means. AE N, AE W - AE \nX, AE BB - AE DD.  \n \nApplicant provided a reference letter from her supervisor and a performance \nevaluation covering the period of August 2008 to September 2008. Her reference \nletter noted Applicant\u2019s \u201chigh level of performance, attention to detail and a willingness \nto go above and beyond to ensure the mission of supporting our soldiers is fulfilled.\u201d \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s exceptional performance, she was promoted from supply \nanalyst to her current position of integrated logistics manager shortly after being \nemployed by her company. Applicant has received an overall \u201coutstanding\u201d on her \nevaluation on both of her performance reviews. AE F \u2013 AE B. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended \nand modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant \nconcerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, \n1995), Section 3. Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I \nhave based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination \nas to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the \nApplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the \nburden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nThe government established that Applicant owed substantial debt as reflected \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.h. through her admissions and evidence presented. At the time the \nSOR was issued in January 2009, Applicant owed eight debts approximating $44,803. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness stems from an overpayment and recoupment issue \nwhile in the Army and two periods of unemployment. This contributed to Applicant \nbeing placed in a financial tailspin.  \n \nHer financial situation has substantially improved as a result of finding a job \nwhich provides her with enough income to support her family and meet her financial \nobligations. Notably, she paid or resolved five of the eight debts alleged before her \nhearing commenced, and has made significant progress in resolving her student \nloans. After her hearing, she provided further documentation of her progress towards  \nrepayment of her student loans, and of her having taken out a loan from her 401k \naccount to pay off her cable bill.  \n \nShe has sought financial counseling, and submitted a credible budget reflecting \nthat she is living within her means. All indicators point to an individual who has taken \nthis process quite seriously and taken what appears to be all reasonable steps to \ncorrect her financial situation. What is different now as opposed to before is that she \nhas the means, tools and resolve to achieve financial stability. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are three potential mitigating conditions: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances;  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) fully applies. Applicant\u2019s indebtedness began while on active duty \nas a result of an overpayment. She struggled to repay her indebtedness to the Army, \nand after her discharge from the Army, she experienced two periods of \nunemployment. She has also been solely responsible for providing full support to her \nson.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies because Applicant sought financial counseling and there are \nclear indications that her finances are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts. In short, Applicant has made substantial progress in \nturning her financial situation around. She has established a viable budget, which \nshows a net remainder after her monthly bills are paid. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I also gave \nconsiderable weight to her years of honorable service in the Army, her years of \nsuccessfully holding a secret clearance, her service as a defense contractor, and her \nbeing the sole provider for her 17-year-old son. In reaching this conclusion, the whole \nperson concept was given due consideration and that analysis does support a \nfavorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 17, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On February 24, 2010,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal. \n1\n \nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge found that Applicant had delinquent credit card debts, unresolved at the close of\nthe record.  Applicant attributed these debts to poor financial decisions he made while young.  He\nno longer uses credit cards.  In the Analysis portion of her decision, the Judge concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts raised Guideline F security concerns.  She further concluded that the\nrecord did not contain sufficient evidence of mitigation to justify the grant of a clearance.  For\nexample, the Judge concluded that there was little or no evidence to demonstrate that Applicant has\nbehaved responsibly in regard to his debts, that he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his\ncreditors, or that his financial problems are behind him and are unlikely to recur.  Accordingly, the\nJudge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in his case.\nIn support of his appeal Applicant has submitted new matters, for example information about\nhis credit score obtained after the close of the record.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d)\nSee also ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2\n(App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  \nApplicant appears to contend on appeal that the Judge did not properly weigh his mitigating\nevidence, for example that he no longer uses a credit cards.  However, a Judge is presumed to have\nconsidered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.\n20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008). In this case, the Judge found that\nApplicant no longer uses credit cards, and she considered other mitigating evidence as well, such as\nhis good work record and the fact that he successfully disputed two of the debts alleged in the SOR.\nHowever, she plausibly explained why the record as a whole is not sufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\nweighed the record evidence in a way that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12,\n2007).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 17, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 30, 2009, \nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing seven \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy the following day. Applicant received the \nFORM on December 28, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. Applicant timely submitted a statement that I marked as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A and admitted into the record without objection. On January 20, \n2010, DOHA assigned the case to me. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in \nParagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. He denied the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1.d, \n1.e, and 2.a. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and married. He has two children, ages 10 and 13, from \na former marriage. He was married to his first wife from July 1996 to October 2004. \nSince April 1999, he has worked for a defense contractor. When he began his \nemployment, he worked in the mailroom; he now holds a position as a technical account \nmanager. He has received awards and promotions over the past 11 years. He attended \ncollege between 1993 and 1997. (Item 1; AE A.) \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions \n28(a) and 28(b), which asked whether he had been 180 days delinquent on any debts in \nthe last 7 years, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. \n(GE 1 at 33.) He did not list the five delinquents debts noted in the SOR, but included \ninformation about an outstanding credit card debt for $5,000, incurred in August 2006. \n(Id. at 33). He answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 27(b) that asked whether he had his wages \ngarnished or property repossessed for any reason in the past 7 years. He disclosed a \ngarnishment order for child support that was entered in September 2004. Under \nadditional comments he wrote, \u201cNot sure of the judgments at this time, but believe there \nwere a couple after my divorce.\u201d (Id. at 32, 33.)  \n \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories regarding delinquent \ndebts listed on credit bureau reports, dated April 2008 and October 2008. He submitted \ncivil pleadings that his lawyer filed relating to one of the listed creditors. He also \nsubmitted his budget, which recorded his net monthly salary as $3,800 and his spouse\u2019s \nas $8,200, for a total net monthly income of $12,000. Their monthly expenses are \n$6,000. They make monthly payments of $5,091 on financial obligations, including a \nmortgage and credit cards, leaving $900 at the end of the month for other expenses. \n(Item 5.) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated April 2008 and July 2009, \nParagraph 1 of the SOR alleged five delinquent debts, totaling $30,598, which became \ndelinquent between 2005 and 2006. (Items 6, 7.) The status of each debt is as follows: \n \n1. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $5,077 is a credit card debt. Applicant \nasserted that the debt has been resolved through a civil case, dismissing the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmatter against him. According to the July 2009 CBR, the debt has been \ndisputed.1  \n \n2. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $11,000 is owed to the same creditor as \nnoted above. According to the July 2009 CBR, the debt has been disputed.  \n \n3. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $1,478 is a credit card debt. Applicant \nadmitted that it is his debt. (Item 4.) It is unresolved. \n \n4. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $1,837 is a credit card debt. Applicant \nasserted that the debt is his father\u2019s obligation. In his August 2009 answer, he \nstated that he intended to resolve it immediately. (Item 4.) It remains \nunresolved.  \n \n5. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $4,106 is a credit card debt. Applicant \nasserted that the debt is his father\u2019s obligation. In his August 2009 answer, he \nstated that he intended to resolve it immediately. (Item 4.) It remains \nunresolved.  \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his delinquent debt to a period of \ntime after his divorce when he was young and \u201cmade terrible financial decisions.\u201d (Item \n4.) He has attempted to correct his mistakes since then. He no longer uses credit cards. \n(AE A.) \n \n  \nApplicant explained in his Answer that he made a \u201cgross mistake\u201d on the e-QIP \nby not disclosing the five debts. He denied that he intentionally failed to disclose the \ndebts. (Item 4.) He attempted to complete it too quickly. He \u201cassumed since the old \ncredit cards were charge offs that they didn\u2019t apply in this section. It was purely an \noversight.\u201d (AE A.) He knew the government would request a credit check. (Id.). He \npointed out that he included information about a credit card in response to question 28 \nand made a note about potential outstanding judgments in response to question 27. \n \n \nOther than his assertions, Applicant submitted no character references or other \nevidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable \nto evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his \ncase decided without a hearing. \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n                                                          \n1The first two SOR debts are owed to the same creditor. Applicant provided a Notice of Dismissal \nreferencing Case No. 08-CVD-1677, and a Notice of Withdrawal of Motion to Compel referencing Case \nNo. 08-CVD-988. (Item 4; 5.) The final outcome of these debts is unclear. \n\n \n4 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n5 \n \n \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe two potentially disqualifying conditions raised by Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are AG & 19(a) an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;@ and AG & \n19(c) Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ Based on two CBRs and his \nstatements, Applicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing \nin 2005, and which he did not begin to address until 2009. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of those security concerns. The guideline \nincludes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated \nwhere Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s five financial \ndelinquencies arose in 2005 and at least three of them remain unresolved to date. \nBecause the problems are ongoing and not isolated, there is a likelihood that that they \nwill continue in the future, and do cast doubt about his judgment. Hence, this condition \ndoes not apply.   \n \nAG & 20(b) states that it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant \nstated that some of his financial problems arose after he divorced in 2004. He also \nadmitted that he made poor decisions related to his finances, and did not offer any \nevidence that he attempted to act responsibly while the debt was accruing or after it \naccrued. This guideline marginally applies.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not present any evidence that \nhe received credit counseling and/or that his financial problems are under control, as \nrequired under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nthat Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@ He did not provide evidence that he paid, attempted to pay, or has a \nrepayment plan for any debt. AG & 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant provided evidence that he has legally disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. That evidence triggers mitigation under AG & 20(e), which applies when \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Although he asserted \nthat the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are not his debts, he did not provide any \nevidence that he has disputed them or taken action to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant falsified one question on the \ne-QIP; to wit, he failed to disclose five debts that were more than 90 and 180 days \ndelinquent under question 28. The government contended that those omissions may \nraise a security concern and be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally omitted information about the \ndelinquent debts. When a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the \ngovernment has the burden of proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not \nestablish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state \nof mind at the time the omission occurred. (See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed a child support garnishment under question 27(b) and \nprovided specific information about it. Although he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28(a) \nand (b), he provided information about an outstanding credit card debt under that \nsection. He explained that his failure to disclose the five delinquent debts was a mistake \nand that he did not think that charged off debts were considered delinquent. Based on \nhis explanations and the disclosure of adverse information under both question 27 and \n28, he demonstrated his intent to be truthful and to not intentionally withhold information \nabout the debts; hence, the government did not establish a disqualifying condition as to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2(a). The omission of the information may be negligent, but it was not \nintentional. Hence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification. This \nGuideline is found in his favor. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 34 years old, married \nand has two children. He has successfully worked for his employer for 11 years, during \nwhich time he has received promotions and commendations. He candidly admitted that \nafter his divorce in 2004, he mismanaged his finances, which lead to an accumulation of \ndelinquent debt. He legally disputed approximately $16,077 of the $30,598 delinquent \ndebt listed in the SOR, but has taken no action to resolve the remaining $14,521, \ndespite receiving the SOR in July 2009 and the FORM at the end of September 2009. \nAlthough he and his new wife have sufficient money to manage their expenses and \ndebts, he failed to establish a track record of resolving delinquent debts and maintaining \nfinancial responsibility, so recurrence of these financial concerns may be likely. The \nrecord contains insufficient other evidence about his character, trustworthiness, or \nreliability to mitigate these concerns. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance at this time. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct, but did not \nmitigate all of the concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant admitted owing more than $43,000 in delinquent debts. He made no\nmeaningful attempt to resolve any of these 19 debts, and provided insufficient evidence\nto mitigate resulting security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 7, 2008. On April 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n1\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 9, 2009\n\nItem 3.\n2\nThe Government submitted seven items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4.\n4\nItem 3.\n5\nItem 7.\n6\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 14, 2009, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on April 28, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non May 4, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He did not submit any additional information,\nand made no objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department\nCounsel, during the 30-day response period. I received the case assignment on June\n17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was widowed in\n2002, divorced in 2007, and currently lives with a woman in a long-term spouse-like\nrelationship. He has seven adult step-children, none of whom reside with him. He has\nbeen employed in his present capacity since May 2008. He has no military service, and\nhas never held a security clearance.  In his response to the SOR, he admitted the truth\n4\nof all the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.s.  Applicant\u2019s admissions,\n5\nincluding those contained in his response to interrogatories,  are incorporated in the\n6\nfollowing findings.\nThe 19 delinquent debts to which Applicant admitted in his SOR response totaled\n$43,074. These debts are for various utility and medical services, as well as credit card\naccounts. They range in amount from $52 to $13,661, with six of them under $150.\nEight of the debts, totaling $3,637, are medical bills. Applicant provided no proof of any\npayment toward, or agreement to repay any of these debts. During his June 6, 2008\ninterview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), he said\nhe was in the process of contacting each of his creditors to make arrangements to pay\noff his delinquent debts. On January 14, 2009, DOHA forwarded the financial\ninterrogatories cited above to Applicant, asking him to document payment or the current\nstatus of his delinquent debts. In his February 17, 2009, response he submitted copies\nof nine letters to creditors, all dated February 5, 2009, asking them to contact him with\narrangements he could make to work with them to repay the debts within the means he\n\nItem 4.\n7\nItem 7.\n8\n3\nhas available. These letters claimed his failure to pay the debts resulted from his\nunemployment and illness, without further elaboration.\nApplicant is a designer. He worked for one company from August 1996 to March\n2002. Although he reported that he had never been fired, or left a job under other\nunfavorable circumstances, his e-QIP reflected subsequent periods of unemployment\nfrom March to August 2002, April 2003 to January 2004, March to April 2004, April to\nJune 2005, September to November 2005, June to September 2006, and September\n2007 to March 2008. The only record evidence concerning illness is Applicant\u2019s e-QIP\nresponse to question 21, where he stated, \u201cI have had the disease of schizophrenia\nsince my late teens. I stay under a psychiatrist\u2019s care and take daily medication.\u201d   \n7\nApplicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement indicated monthly net income of\n$2,596, with expenses of $2,493, leaving $103 in \u201ccushion and entertainment\u201d funds. He\nclaimed to own no assets.  Applicant offered no evidence of credit or financial\n8\ncounseling. He offered no other evidence concerning his character, trustworthiness or\nresponsibility. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor or character in person\nsince he elected to have his case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.\nDepartment Counsel cited AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\nAG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and both are supported by\nthis record. Applicant did not even show an effort to resolve any of his smaller\ndelinquencies, and has insufficient monthly income to make meaningful payments\ntoward his larger debts. He did not demonstrate the ability to pay these debts going\nforward. He has a history of not meeting his financial obligations and apparent inability\nto hold a job for long enough to avoid additional delinquencies. The evidence supporting\nthese disqualifying conditions requires a closer examination and balancing of resulting\nsecurity concerns with any potentially mitigating matters, and shifts the burden to\nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\n\n5\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nirresponsibility is recent and continues to date. He remains substantially in debt and his\ncurrent financial situation precludes a finding that delinquent indebtedness is unlikely to\nrecur. The evidence does not support application of this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s medical\nexpenses arose from a chronic condition for which he has been under treatment for\nmore than 30 years, and will continue to be into the foreseeable future. His medical\ndelinquencies represent less than 10% of his bad debt. He did suffer about 30 months\nof unemployment between 2002 and 2008. However, he neither showed that these\nperiods were beyond his control nor demonstrated that he responsibly reduced non-\nessential spending in reaction to them. Applicant has not established mitigation of any\nof his debts or his financial history as a whole under this provision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d There is no evidence of financial counseling, nor of any\nmeaningful efforts to resolve his delinquencies. The record is also devoid of evidence\nsupporting his ability to repay more than $43,000 in outstanding delinquent debts.\nInsufficient efforts have occurred to date to alleviate the substantial security concerns\nraised by the length and degree of financial irresponsibility that continues to date. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his choices and conduct. He presently has at least $43,000 in debt,\nand did not meet his burden to prove an ongoing ability to repay it. None of his debt was\nshown to have arisen for reasons beyond his control. There is insufficient evidence to\nsupport a finding that such financial irresponsibility will not recur. His debts continue to\ncreate substantial potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. The record contains\ninsufficient other evidence about his character or responsibility to mitigate these\nconcerns, or tending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of not meeting\nhis financial obligations and inability to satisfy his current debts. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to renew his security clearance. He served in the military from 1992 through 2001, and was honorably discharged. He has worked for his current employer since December 2007. He has been steadily employed since he discharged from the military. He was married from 1999 until his divorce in 2000. He married again in 2003, separated in 2004, and divorced in 2006. He married again in 2007. He has primary joint custody of his six-year-old child from his second marriage.1 Applicant attributed his financial problems to his second wife\u2019s spending, his separation and divorce, her failure to pay her share of the marital debt, and the costly legal fees incident to a protracted custody battle. While they were married, he agreed to cosign loans for two new cars for her, even though he had two older cars and a motorcycle that were owned outright. One of his older cars was being restored and was inoperable, and the other car had mechanical problems. She wanted to have an extra car available for his use in case his older cars broke down. She did not want him borrowing her car. She took both cars in the divorce, and both cars ended up being repossessed.2 The SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, which includes two debts reduced to judgments.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 28, \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 4, 2009, scheduling the hearing for \nAugust 19, 2009. The case was reassigned to me on August 12, 2009. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A through O, which were received without objection. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted 13 pages of documents, \nwhich were marked AE P through V and admitted without objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s memorandum is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on September 8, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing.

He is seeking to \nrenew his security clearance. He served in the military from 1992 through 2001, and \nwas honorably discharged. He has worked for his current employer since December \n2007. He has been steadily employed since he discharged from the military. He was \nmarried from 1999 until his divorce in 2000. He married again in 2003, separated in \n2004, and divorced in 2006. He married again in 2007. He has primary joint custody of \nhis six-year-old child from his second marriage.1  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his second wife\u2019s spending, his \nseparation and divorce, her failure to pay her share of the marital debt, and the costly \nlegal fees incident to a protracted custody battle. While they were married, he agreed to \ncosign loans for two new cars for her, even though he had two older cars and a \nmotorcycle that were owned outright.

She did not want him \nborrowing her car. She took both cars in the divorce, and both cars ended up being \nrepossessed.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, which includes two debts reduced to \njudgments. The debts were listed on credit reports dated July 22, 2008, and May 13, \n2009. Applicant admitted owing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He admitted in part and \ndenied in part the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. He denied owing the \nremaining debts.3 Individual debts are addressed below. \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 25-26, 31, 40-42; GE 1, 2; AE L-N. \n \n2 Tr. at 25-35, 39-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE L-N. \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $19,473 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The \ndebt was for the deficiency owed on a car loan after the car was repossessed. This was \none of the car loans that he cosigned for his second wife. Applicant stated that he plans \non including this and his other debts in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, as discussed below.4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges an unpaid judgment awarded against Applicant on behalf of \nan insurance company in the amount of $22,000. Applicant did not deny that a judgment \nwas awarded against him. He was in a car accident. He stated the driver of the other \ncar slammed on her brakes when her dog jumped in her lap. He hit her car when she \ncut him off. He provided the information to his insurance company, which stated they \nwere denying the other driver\u2019s claim. Applicant stated he was sued by her insurance \ncompany while he was out of town. A default judgment was awarded against him for \n$22,000. In June 2009, the balance on the judgment, counting interest and fees, was \n$23,932.5   \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the unpaid judgment of $1,302 to a law firm, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. He stated this debt was for the attorney handling his divorce. He was \ndissatisfied with his representation and disputed the bill. The balance on the judgment \nwas $1,539 in June 2009.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege past-due debts of $465 and $567 owed to the same \ncredit card company. Applicant testified that both debts were \u201ccurrent and paid off in \nfull.\u201d After the hearing, he submitted his account statements from August 2009. One \naccount listed a balance of $420, which was above the credit limit of $300, and included \na late fee of $29. The second account listed a balance of $559, which was above the \ncredit limit of $400, and included a return item charge of $25, an over limit fee of $25, \nand a late fee of $25.7   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a past-due auto loan with a balance of $11,000. The May 13, \n2009 credit report lists the debt as $414 past due. Applicant admitted that he fell behind \non the debt, but he contacted the creditor and worked out a plan to bring the loan \ncurrent. He submitted a letter from the creditor dated August 21, 2009. The letter stated \nthat his account balance was $10,470 and \u201c[t]he account has a present due date of \n8/01/09.\u201d8   \n \n \nIn June 2009, Applicant paid the delinquent debt of $299 owed to a credit union.  \nThis debt was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g.9   \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 26-28, 32-33, 46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 46-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE I. \n \n6 Tr. at 46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE J \n \n7 Tr. at 43-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE S, T. \n \n8 Tr. at 42-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE V. \n \n9 Tr. at 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE G. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent debt of $396 to a collection company. Applicant \nsubmitted a letter from the collection company indicating that a debt being collected on \nbehalf of a telecommunications company had been settled. SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a \ndelinquent debt of $76 to the same telecommunications company. There is insufficient \nevidence for a determination that these represent two distinct debts.10   \n \n \nApplicant admitted and denied the debts of $7,265, $4,152, and $980, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. He admitted owing the two credit card debts of $7,265 and \n$4,152. He denied the two allegations because he stated his second wife was supposed \nto pay the debts. He plans on including these debts in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He \nadmitted owing the $980 cell phone bill. He denied the allegation because he stated his \nsecond wife\u2019s mother ran the bill up. His second wife agreed to pay the bill but did not. \nHe stated that he had an agreement with the creditor to settle the debt, and he made \none payment of about $176. He stopped making payments on the settlement because \nhis bankruptcy attorney advised him to leave the debt for his bankruptcy plan. Applicant \nwas asked to provide proof of the payment in his post-hearing submission, but no proof \nof that payment was provided.11 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a delinquent debt of $295 owed to a collection company on \nbehalf of a cable television and internet provider company. Applicant submitted letters \nfrom the collection company and the cable company indicating the account was paid in \n2005. The cable company noted that \u201cthe monetary balance on the account was due to \nan incorrect disconnect date on [company\u2019s] part.\u201d The collection company \u201cinvestigated \n[his] dispute.\u201d Based upon their investigation, the company closed the account and \nnotified the credit bureaus to delete the account from his credit report.12   \n \n \nA judgment of $10,377 was awarded against Applicant and his second wife on \nbehalf of an automobile finance company in 2005. The judgment was for the deficiency \nowed on a car loan after the car was repossessed. This was the second car loan that \nApplicant cosigned for his second wife. The balance on the judgment was $16,257 in \nJune 2009. This debt was not alleged in the SOR.13   \n \n \nTo summarize Applicant\u2019s debts, he paid or settled two debts totaling $695 (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 1.h); he successfully disputed a $295 debt that was paid in 2005 (\u00b6 1.m); he \ndisputed a $76 debt as a duplicate debt(\u00b6 1.l); he is paying three debts with balances \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n10 Tr. at 36, 44-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, H. \n \n11 Tr. at 45, 51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.  \n \n12 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, C-F. \n \n13 Tr. at 26-28, 32-35; AE K. This judgment will not be used for disqualification purposes. It will be \nconsidered in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, \nand in analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \ntotaling $11,449, which were past-due at some point (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1,e, and 1.f); and he did \nnot provide proof of payments on the remaining six unpaid judgments and delinquent \ndebts totaling $57,341 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k). He also has an unpaid \njudgment of $16,257 that was not alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s total debt, which \nincludes debts that may not be past due and a debt that was not alleged, is \napproximately $85,000. \n \n \nApplicant contracted with an attorney in June 2009, to file a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy on his behalf. Applicant submitted a Chapter 13 plan worksheet. The \nworksheet listed $2,600 in attorney fees and the total amount of non-priority unsecured \ndebt at $55,862. The worksheet did not list individual creditors. The worksheet proposed \nalternate plans in which Applicant would either pay $210 per month for 13 months, \nfollowed by payments of $7 per month for 47 months, or he would pay $210 per month \nfor 15 months. The worksheet called for $200 per month for 13 months, or $2,600, \nwould be paid to his attorney. It called for $300 to be paid to his non-priority unsecured \ndebt. The monthly car loan payment of $420 to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f would be paid \noutside his plan. The plan has not been approved by the bankruptcy court. Applicant \ncompleted the financial counseling required by the bankruptcy court.14    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n                                                          \n14 Tr. at 36-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE O, U. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant paid, settled, disputed, or brought current several debts. He retained \nan attorney to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on his behalf, but the plan has not been \napproved by the bankruptcy court. He still owes more than $57,000 in unpaid judgments \nand delinquent debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his second wife\u2019s spending, his \nseparation and divorce, her failure to pay her share of the marital debt, and the costly \nlegal fees incident to a protracted custody battle. These all qualify as conditions that \nwere outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the \nindividual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant cosigned for two car loans \nwhen he was married, even though he had two older cars and a motorcycle for his use. \nThat is not responsible conduct. He paid two of the debts listed in the SOR, totaling \n$695. Another debt was successfully disputed as paid in 2005. He is in the process of \nfiling Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which is a legal means of addressing one\u2019s burdensome \ndebt. The plan has not been approved, and he has not started the payments to the \ntrustee. He has not submitted sufficient information for a determination that his actions \nregarding his finances have been completely responsible. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable.   \n \n \nApplicant has received some financial counseling. His Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nplan has not been approved by the court, and he has not established a track record of \npayments to the trustee. It is too early in the process for a determination that his \nfinancial problems are resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant paid two debts. Three debts that were listed as past due are being \npaid. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to those five debts. Those payments do not support a \nfinding that he made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve all his delinquent debts.15 AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is not applicable to the unpaid debts. \n \n \nApplicant successfully disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. The debt in \u00b6 1.l is a \nduplicate of another debt that was paid. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those two debts.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that financial concerns are still present despite the presence \nof some mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n                                                          \n15 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No.  99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n9 \n \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his steady employment record. Many of his \ndelinquent debts can be traced to his second wife and their extended custody battle. He \npaid two debts totaling $695 and is in the process of filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His \nbankruptcy plan has not been approved by the court, and he has not begun making \npayments to the trustee. He still owes more than $57,000 in unpaid judgments and \ndelinquent debts. I am also concerned about how Applicant handled his past-due debts. \nHe testified that his debts of $465 and $567 were \u201ccurrent and paid off in full.\u201d The \naccount statements submitted after the hearing showed both accounts with balances \nover the credit limit and included late fees, a return item charge, and an over limit fee. \nApplicant has not established a track record of financially responsible conduct. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 4, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D. Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 20, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On April 23, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as\namended) ; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, (as amended), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under\nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on May 5, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on June 1, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 3, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for June 24, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented six\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant presented no\nexhibits, but testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until July 24, 2009,\nto allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted\neight  Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A through\nH.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on July 2, 2009.  Based upon a review of\n\n2\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 32 years old and has a high school diploma and two years of\ncollege.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Office Manager and is seeking\nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant admits to twenty of the twenty-five debts set forth in the SOR\nunder this guideline.  Namely, that he is indebted in the amount totaling approximately\n$25,000.00.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated May 8, 2008; March 20, 2009; May\n26, 2009; and June 19, 2009, reflect that the following debts remain owing.\n(Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6).    \nIn 1993, when the Applicant joined the Marine Corps at the age of eighteen, he\nhad good credit.  He served honorably for four years and was discharged in August\n1997.  While in the military, he got married and had a child, against his mother\u2019s advice.\nHis wife benefitted from the Applicant\u2019s good credit, and charged up credit cards to\npurchase unnecessary things.  Debt piled up that the Applicant could not afford to pay.\nAfter a year, the marriage went downhill, they separated and eventually divorced.\nApplicant was held responsible for most of the debt incurred during the marriage.  The\nApplicant moved back into the barracks and went back to school.  Except for his student\nloans for college and several cell phone bills, most of the Applicant\u2019s debt set forth in\nthe SOR occurred during this marriage.  The Applicant plans to resolve these debts as\nsoon as possible.  In 2006, the Applicant began working for his current employer.  \nDebts owed to a medical provider in the amounts of $106.00, $68.00, $187.00,\n$165.00, $67.00, $44.00, $60.00 and $604.00 remain outstanding.  (Allegations 1(a),\n1(c), 1(e), 1(n), 1(o), 1(p), 1(q), 1(u) and 1(w).)  Applicant contends that he has no idea\nhow these medical bills were incurred because he had full medical coverage while he\nwas in the Marines.  (Tr. pp. 49, 52, and 53).  Applicant did nothing to investigate the\nmatters.      \nApplicant disputed a debt owed to a telephone company in the amount of\n$294.00.  (Allegation 1(b).)  The debt is no longer reflected as owing on the Applicant\u2019s\nmost recent credit report.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).  \n\n3\nApplicant was indebted to a bank in the amount of $706.00.  (Allegation 1(d).)\nHe testified that he has reduced the debt to $500.00 (Tr. p. 39 - 40).  Applicant provided\nno documentary evidence to support his testimony. \nA debt owed to a bank in the amount of $2,172.00 remains outstanding.\n(Allegation 1(f).)  Applicant contends that he is disputing the debt because the charges\nhave been trumped up and he does not owe what the creditor purports.  (Tr. p. 50).\nApplicant provided no documentary evidence to support his testimony.\nA debt owed to a bank in the amount of $559.00 remains outstanding.\n(Allegation 1(g).)  Applicant indicates that the bank has no record of the debt and he\ndoes not understand why the collection agency is still involved.  Recently, he has\nstarted the process of settling this account.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits D and\nE).  \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $935.00 remains outstanding.\nApplicant is not aware of the debt and did nothing to investigate the matter.  (Allegation\n1(h).)  (Tr. p. 52).\nDebts owed to a bank for student loans in the amounts of $636.00 and $494.00\nremain outstanding, but are in deferment.  (Allegations 1(i) and 1(j).)  Applicant\u2019s most\nrecent credit report reflects that this debt is current.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit C\nand Tr. p. 47).  \nDebts owed to a lending institution for student loans in the amount of $119.00\nand $180.00 remain outstanding, but are in deferment.  (Allegations 1(k) and 1(l).)\nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report reflects that this debt is current.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit C and Tr. p. 47).  \nDebts owed to a college in the amount of $5,318.00 and $4,803.00 remain\noutstanding, but are in deferment.  (Allegations 1(r) and 1(s).)  Applicant\u2019s most recent\ncredit report reflects that this debt is current.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit C and\nTr. p. 47). \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $135.00 remains outstanding.\nApplicant did nothing to investigate the matter.  (Allegation 1(t).)\nA debt owed to a telephone company in the amount of $808.00 remains\noutstanding.  (Allegation 1(v)).  Recently, he has started the process of settling this\naccount.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits D and E).\nA debt owed to a gym in the amount of $694.00 remains outstanding.  (Allegation\n1(x).)  Applicant submitted proof of the fact that he is a member of a class action\ndisputing the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B).\n\n4\nA debt owed to a telephone company in the amount of $936.00 remains\noutstanding.  (Allegation 1(y).)  Recently, he has started the process of settling this\naccount.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits D and E).\nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $5,290.00 remains outstanding.\n(Allegation 1(m).)  Applicant explained that his vehicle was stolen and eventually found,\nbut the registration tags had been removed.  The car was wrongfully towed and\neventually auctioned off.  Applicant stopped making the payments on the debt he owed\non the vehicle and he does not intend to pay it.  (Tr. pp. 40 - 41). \n  \nThe Applicant has incurred no new delinquent debt since this marriage.  He is\ncurrent with all of his monthly expenses and now pays his bills on time.  \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal for the period from May 2007 through\nNovember 2007 reflects \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d ratings in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit G).\nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor indicates that the\nApplicant has successfully performed is duties on the job.  He is timely, courteous and\ndemonstrates dedication to all task assignments.  He is considered responsible in\nrespect to discretion, ownership and loyalty.  He is highly recommended for a position of\ntrust and is being considered for promotion.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit H).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n\n5\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18 -19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct \n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary \nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n6\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility, which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case. Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19.(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligation apply.  Although, Mitigating Condition 20.(b) the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\nalso applies, it is not controlling in this case.  \nPrior to his first marriage, the Applicant had good credit.  Once in the military and\nnewly married, his wife at that time incurred debt that the Applicant could not afford to\npay.  Admittedly these circumstances were largely beyond his control.  He claims that\nhe was not aware of the extent of his indebtedness until his security clearance\ninvestigation.  However, after becoming aware of the debt, he has done very little to\nresolve it.  With regard to his student loans, he has placed them on deferment and plans\nto pay them when they become due.  But, there are many other debts, some of which\nare fairly small, that he has simply ignored.  He has indicated that he has started the\n\n7\nprocess of disputing several of his debts, and that he will clear them up, but at the\npresent time, they remain owing, and he has not demonstrated financial responsibility.\nUnder the circumstances, he has not made a good faith effort to resolve his past\nindebtedness, and there is insufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.\nHopefully, the Applicant will continue to work toward resolving his delinquent\nindebtedness and can demonstrate in the future that he can properly handle his\nfinancial affairs.  Accordingly, at this time, I must find against the Applicant under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).\n    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, and it does not mitigate the\nnegative effects of his financial indebtedness and its impact on his ability to safeguard\nclassified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome\nthe Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.y.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June \n17, 2009, I was assigned the case. On July 1, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing for July 30, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through G, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On August 14, 2009, and August 24, 2009, additional \nmaterial was submitted. Department Counsel had no objection to the material, which \nwas admitted into the record as Ex. H through Ex. M . On August 6, 2009, the transcript \n(Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 \nand 1.h.

After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old project manager who has worked for a government \nagency since July 2008. (Tr. 39) She is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Her \nyearly salary is $78,000. (Tr. 42, 87)  \n \n \nFrom September 2002 to January 2005, Applicant was employed as a security \nofficer and paid $43,000 a year. (Tr. 91) During 2002 and 2003, and again from 2005 to \n2007, Applicant obtained student loans of $5,114 and $3,381 (SOR \u00b6 1.e and 1.f) to \nattend college. Applicant is five credits short of her Bachelor of Arts degree. (Tr. 54) The \nloans were in forbearance until March 2009. (Tr. 51) In March 2009, the creditor offered \nApplicant various plans to repay her loans. Applicant chose a graduated 15-year \nrepayment plan whereby her monthly payments start at $25 on one loan and at $16 on \nthe other. (Tr. 76, 81, Ex. E) Applicant owed the state $856 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) for unpaid \ntuition, which was paid in October 2008. (Tr. 77, Ex. F) Applicant paid a $50 insurance \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Ex. G) \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant left her job to stay at home with her five children, \naged 12, 10, 8, 7, and 3. (Tr. 53) She took a job as a mortgage loan officer, which paid \n$13,000 a year. (Tr. 23, 90) In August 2007, her husband, a hypnotherapist, ended his \nbusiness, which paid approximately $24,000 a year. (Tr.91) He is now a stay-at-home \nfather taking classes to become a dog trainer. (Tr. 49)  \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant opened a home-based slumber parties business, which was funded by \nsales and loans. Her net monthly income from the business was $2,000. (Tr. 89) She \nended the business in 2009. (Tr. 88) The business generated enough income to pay the \nhome utilities and provide food. (Tr. 23, 115) Applicant cashed out her $60,000 401(k) \nretirement fund and sold her jewelry worth $3,000 to make mortgage and utilities \npayments. (Ex. D) During this period, Applicant maintained communication with her \ncreditors. (Tr. 24, Ex. D) In December 2007, she began sending out her resumes. (Tr. \n23) In May 2008, when she was notified she would be obtaining her present job, she \nincreased her communication with her creditors. (Tr. 24)  \n \n \nApplicant used two credit cards to pay living expenses, including food and \nutilities. (Tr. 47, 63) She made sporadic payments on these accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.a, \n$5,296 and SOR \u00b6 1.b, $5,799). In February 2009, the creditor offered to settle the first \ndebt for $3,443. Applicant accepted the offer and has been making $573 monthly \npayments since March 2009. (Tr. 48, Ex. A) On August 14, 2009, there was a release of \ndebt. (Not further explained, Ex. M) Applicant has been making $122 monthly payments \non the other credit card account, which now has a balance of $1,823. (Tr. 48, Ex. B, Ex. \nJ) \n \n \nApplicant purchased her home for $352,000, and borrowed $44,000 on a home \nequity line of credit (HELOC). (Ex. 3) As to the HELOC, a loan re-modification under the \nNational Homeownership Retention Program (NHRP) was approved on her note, but \nthe monthly payment has yet to be determined. (Tr. 44, 45, Ex. D) The monthly payment \namount will fluctuate between $248 and $278. (Ex. L) Applicant has been making her \n$248 monthly payments on the HELOC. (Tr. 66, Ex. C) Applicant\u2019s mortgage company \ncashed her July 2009 payment when received. (Tr. 46)  \n \nIn obtaining her mortgage, it was Applicant\u2019s plan to obtain a mortgage with \nmonthly payments equal to her rent of $1,500. The mortgage was an adjustable rate \nmortgage, an option ARM. (Tr. 42) Her mortgage required $1,345 principle and interest \npayments to which were added monthly escrow amounts for insurance and property \ntaxes. (Ex. 3) Her monthly mortgage was approximately $3,000. In September 2007, \nApplicant stopped making her mortgage payments. (Tr. 42, 74) As of March 2009, she \nwas $24,503 delinquent on her mortgage. (Tr. 3)  \n \nApplicant has been in close contact with her mortgage company about this \ndelinquency. She has been working with the mortgage company\u2019s home retention team. \n(Ex. D) Various plans have been explored and some attempted. In December 2008, a \nloan re-modification was approved and then the paperwork fell through, meaning the \nloan was not received. (Tr. 44) In February or March 2009, the program was reinstated \nand Applicant\u2019s loan modification package was again submitted. (Tr. 44) Applicant\u2019s \nmortgage company told her not to make any mortgage payments while negotiations \nwere being conducted. (Tr. 73) Applicant has weekly communication with her mortgage \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncompany. (Tr. 25) In July 2009, Applicant was told she did not qualify for the Making \nHome Affordable Program, but other loan modifications were under review. (Ex. D) \n \n \nIn May 2008 and October 2008, Applicant\u2019s father was hospitalized. (Tr. 25) He \ndied in June 2009. Applicant lives within four miles of her mother and has been helping \nher with her finances and the arrangements concerning her father\u2019s death. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant and her husband own a 2001 automobile and a Dodge automobile on which \nthey owe approximately $6,000 and $8,000. (Tr. 110) She is current on the $205 and \n$300 monthly payments.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. At one time, Applicant owed approximately $37,500 on eight past due, \ncharged off, or placed-for-collection obligations. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(a) only partially apply because the debts were \nrecent and numerous. However, Applicant has paid or is paying all of her obligations, \nexcept for her mortgage. She is working closely with her mortgage company\u2019s home \nretention team. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being addressed.  \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(b) have limited applicability. Applicant changed \njobs and her husband ended his business to return to school. These events may not \nhave been anticipated, but are not conditions largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control.  \n \nThe mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(c) apply. Applicant not received financial \ncounseling, but she has addressed her financial problems. She is not receiving calls or \nmail from creditors demanding payment, and she is paying her debts as agreed. Her \nmortgage company has told her not to make any payments while various loan \nmodification plans are attempted. Applicant maintains weekly contact with her mortgage \ncompany. She has not simply forgotten about her past due mortgage, but is working to \nfind a solution. \n \nExcept for her past due mortgage, Applicant has paid or is making payments on \nall of the debts listed in the SOR, including her student loans. This shows a good-faith \neffort to repay debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntypes that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. She does not appear to be living \nbeyond her means. Both she and her husband drive 2001 vehicles. The debts set forth \nin the SOR were not incurred for luxuries, but were for student loans and living \nexpenses. \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all her debts are paid\u2014it is whether her financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & \n2(a)(1).) In January 2007, Applicant left her job to stay at home with her five children. \nShe obtained a job as a mortgage loan officer, and she opened a home business \nbringing in $2,000 per month. At this time, her husband was also working.  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s income failed to meet expenses, she sold her jewelry and \ncashed out her 401(k) retirement plan to pay the mortgage and meet daily living \nexpenses. When she was unable to continue with her mortgage payments, she kept in \nclose contact with the mortgage company and the home retention team. She continues \nto explore various loan modification plans. Cashing out her retirement plan and selling \nher jewelry shows a desire to satisfy her debts and meet her financial obligations.  \n \nSince obtaining her current job, with an annual salary is $78,000, she paid or has \nbrought current all of her debts except for her past due mortgage. Her constant \ncommunication with her mortgage company\u2019s home retention team indicates she will \naddress her past due mortgage. While Applicant has not paid off all of her debts, she is \ncertainly making progress in addressing those obligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge  \n",

On January 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Appellant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJuly 22, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about February 13, 2009, and requested a \nhearing.  DOHA assigned the case to me on March 11, 2009, and issued a Notice of \nHearing on May 11, 2009. The case was heard on June 11, 2009, as scheduled.  \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through D into \nevidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until \nJune 22, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted four exhibits that I marked AE E through H, and admitted into \nthe record without objection by the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on June 29, 2009.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all allegations contained in the Paragraph 1 of SOR.  His \nadmissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, married and has two children, ages 8 and 5. In 1993, \nhe graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics, and in 1999, he \nearned a master\u2019s degree in applied mathematics. In February 1997, he began a \nposition as a software engineer for a defense contractor. He received a Top Secret \nsecurity clearance in March 1997 that he has held since.   \n \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant began the security clearance renewal process. In \nJuly 2007, he and his family moved to his home state and started a position for which a \nsecurity clearance was not required. About ten months later, he and his wife returned to \nlive in the state that they had previously left. In September 2008, he obtained a position \nwith a subcontractor for his former employer, who then re-initiated the security \nclearance process. Applicant informed his employer of financial concerns that arose \nduring the initial clearance investigation in 2006. (Tr. 29) He did not attempt to hide the \nissue from his employer. (Tr. 33)  \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2004 when he and his wife were \nspending more money than they earned and essentially \u201cliving beyond one\u2019s means.\u201d \n(Tr. 36)  After accruing about $95,000 in delinquent debt by late 2005, he and his wife \ndecided to seek financial assistance through a company that specializes in resolving \ndebt. (Tr. 40) In February 2006, he deposited $900 into a trust account and has \nsubsequently deposited $1,200 every month since. He has deposited approximately \n$35-40,000 into the fund to-date. When the fund accumulates sufficient funds to settle a \ndebt, the company negotiates a resolution. (Tr. 42-44)  \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated October 4, 2006 and October 17, \n2008, the SOR alleged four debts, totaling $82,303 that became delinquent in \nSeptember 2006.  The status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $35 medical debt. He paid the debt in January 2009.      \n(Tr. 45-46)  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $25,030 debt owed to a credit card company. The debt \nresolution company has been negotiating a resolution of the debt. He \nanticipates paying it in 12 to 14 months after he has deposited sufficient \nmoney into the debt resolution fund.  He believes he will be able to settle it for \nabout $12-14,000. (Tr.  49-51)  \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $52,396 debt owed to a credit card company. The debt \nresolution company settled the debt for $21,000. It was paid in May 2009 with \nmonies that had accumulated in the debt fund. He is awaiting a final receipt \nfrom the creditor. (Tr. 53-60; AE B) \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $4,842 judgment that he paid with the assistance of the \ndebt resolution company which negotiated a $3,000 settlement. He made \n$150 monthly payments for about 24 months and then a lump sum payment \nof $1,300 in February 2009. (Tr. 62-66;  AE C, D)  \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant has resolved three of the four debts. He anticipates \npaying the remaining $25,030 debt in a year when he accumulates between $12-14,000 \nin the debt trust fund to which he contributes monthly. (AE F)  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have a combined yearly salary of $134,000. Their net \nmonthly income is $7,884 and their monthly expenses, which include the $1,200 \npayment, are about the same. (AE H) He and his wife no longer use credit cards. They \nhave taken steps to prevent similar problems from recurring in the future, as they strictly \nadhere to their budget. (Tr. 82-84)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Letter of Recommendation from the president and chief \nexecutive officer (CEO) of the company for which he works. The CEO is aware of \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems and steps he is taking to resolve them. He noted that \nApplicant has \u201calways displayed a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and ambition.\u201d \n(AE E) Applicant\u2019s 2009 Performance Appraisal notes an over-all good performance \nrecord. (AE G)   \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly and displayed remorse and embarrassment over his \ndelinquent debts. He accepts full responsibility for the financial obligations and \nacknowledges his irresponsible spending.  He is aware of the potential negative effect \nthat delinquent debt may have on his employment. He has a solid understanding of his \nfinancial situation and budget.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the Financial Considerations guideline is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n \n \n \n5\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt between \n2004 and December 2005, as a result of overspending. In early 2006, he started \nresolving the debt, some of which remains unresolved. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial problems arose between 2004 and December 2005, \ninvolved numerous creditors, were the result of overspending, and reflected poor \n\n \n \n \n \n6\njudgment at the time; thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are attributable \nto overspending and financial mismanagement, which were conditions within his control. \nHence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has no application.  In February 2006, he sought credit counseling \nand has been aggressively addressing the delinquent debts since, such that there are \n\u201cindications that the problem is being resolved,\u201d warranting the application of AG \u00b6 \n20(c). He has resolved and paid three debts, totaling $52,273, and is accumulating \nmoney to resolve the final $25,030 debt. His action, along with a budget that takes into \naccount the delinquent debt, is evidence of a good-faith effort to \u201crepay or otherwise \nresolve debts,\u201d and triggers the application of AG \u00b6 20(d). \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) or AG \u00b6 \n20(f). \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 39-year-old man, who \ncandidly admits that he and his wife spent more money than they earned, leading to the \naccumulation of significant debt by the end of 2005.  In early 2006 (before the initiation \nof the security clearance process), he entered into a debt resolution program through \nwhich he has resolved $57,273 of the $82,303 delinquent debt. He will resolve the \nremaining $25,303 in twelve to fourteen months. He acknowledged his financial \nobligations and the potential negative effect it can have on his employment. After \nlistening to him and observing his demeanor, I find that it is unlikely that he will repeat \nhis irresponsible financial behavior or fail to follow through on his current plan to resolve \nthe remaining debt. He is committed to financial solvency.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old former senior technician of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR that were admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Before 1992, Applicant and her husband (H) operated two businesses. She aided her husband in his operations of one of the businesses (a one-hour photo shop according to her account), but not very much, if at all, according to H\u2019s account (compare ex. 2; I R.T. at 78-79, 82)); while H managed an electronics business (see ex. 2). H claimed that he handled all of the finances for both businesses (I R.T., at 79-81). Both Applicant and H accumulated a number of delinquent debts prior to 1992, when business conditions deteriorated for both businesses. Unable to address their 4 debts with the resources available to them, Applicant and H petitioned jointly for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in August 1992 (see ex. 2). In their petition, they scheduled $268,000 in secured claims, $6,758 in unsecured priority claims (covering personal and property taxes), and $236,189 in unsecured, non-priority claims (see ex. 3). Applicant and H received their bankruptcy discharge in December 1992.

The hearing was convened as scheduled for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of eight exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including herself)\nand eight exhibits.  The transcript (I R.T.) of the initial proceeding was received on May\nAugust 31, 2009\n\n2\n28, 2009; the transcript of the resumed proceeding (II R.T.) was received on July 10,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nAt the outset of the hearing, Applicant moved to amend her answer to respond to\nthe allegations covered by subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b.  Department Counsel did not\ninterpose any objections to Applicant\u2019s motion, and for good cause shown, Applicant\nwas permitted to respond to her answer by inter-lineation.  She entered denials to each\nof the allegations. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented payments of her listed debts. For good cause shown, Applicant\nwas granted 13 days, to June 1, 2009, to supplement the record.  The Government was\nafforded three days, to June 4, 2009, to respond.  Applicant did not supplement the\nrecord. \nPrior to the close of the hearing, the Government moved to continue the\nremainder of the hearing to afford Applicant the opportunity to obtain the services of a\ncertified court-translator to assist her in discerning the questions posed to her by\nDepartment Counsel.  For good cause shown, the hearing was tentatively convened to\nJune 1, 2009 (R.T., at 137). \nOn May 27, 2009, JPAS received a confirmation of Applicant\u2019s service separation\n(effective May 27, 2009).  Applicant\u2019s personal representative advised Department\nCounsel on June 1, 2009 of Applicant\u2019s separation and her corresponding intention not\nto appear at the rescheduled hearing (II R.T., at 2-3).  Because the hearing process had\nalready commenced, DOHA was required to complete the hearing and issue a written\ndecision on the merits in accordance with Section 4.41 of the Directive.\nA conference call was convened with the parties on May 26, 2009, to consider a\nchange in the tentatively rescheduled June 1, 2009 hearing.  In this conference call,\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant\u2019s personal representative (appearing in behalf of\nApplicant) agreed to a June 24, 2009 date for reconvening the hearing. \nAt the reconvened hearing on June 24, 2009, Department Counsel appeared on\nbehalf of the government.  Applicant and her representative did not appear or provide\nany documented or oral reasons for her non-appearance.\nDepartment Counsel was afforded leave to summarize the Government\u2019s case in\na closing argument. Department Counsel cited prejudice from Applicant\u2019s failure to\nafford her the opportunity to complete her cross-examination in the reconvened hearing\nas good cause to enter an administrative default.  Alternatively, Department Counsel\nurged denial of Applicant\u2019s clearance application on substantive grounds under both\ncontrolling guidelines: financial considerations and personal conduct. \n\n3\nIn accordance with the guidance furnished by Section 4.41 of the Directive, and\nthe absence of any countervailing guidance from the Appeal Board, disposition of the\ncase must be resolved based on a thorough review of the evidence compiled to date.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant (a) filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy relief in August 1992 and received her discharge in December 1992; (b) had\na judgment entered against her in April 2007 by creditor 1.b in the amount of $4,171; (c)\nhad a judgment entered against her in May 2007 by creditor 1.c in the amount of\n$4,238; and (d) accumulated six delinquent debts exceeding $36,000.\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant: (a) omitted her outstanding\njudgments when answering question 27(d) of her security clearance application of\nFebruary 2008 and (b) omitted her debts delinquent over 180 days, and 90 days\ncurrently delinquent, respectively, when responding to questions 28(a) and 28(b). \nFor her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to petitioning for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy relief and receiving her discharge of financial liability. She admitted, too, to\nhaving outstanding debts with creditors 1.d, 1.e, 1.f and 1.g.  But she denied having any\noutstanding judgments with creditors 1.b and 1.c (claiming she satisfied these\njudgments), and she denied any outstanding debts with creditors 1.h and 1.i (claiming\nsatisfaction of each of these accounts). \nApplicant did not respond to the allegations pertaining to creditors 2.a and 2.b.  In\nher cover letter accompanying her answer, she claimed she did not appreciate the\nseriousness of her financial delinquencies caused by her husband\u2019s business failure,\nand felt too ashamed to disclose it.  She claimed that most of her delinquent debts were\nsolved through collection agencies, and the rest will be settled in a few months with\nrecoveries from her husband\u2019s business development.  \n                                              \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old former senior technician of a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR that were admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nBefore 1992, Applicant and her husband (H) operated two businesses. She aided\nher husband in his operations of one of the businesses (a one-hour photo shop\naccording to her account), but not very much, if at all, according to H\u2019s account\n(compare ex. 2; I R.T. at 78-79, 82)); while H managed an electronics business (see ex.\n2).  H claimed that he handled all of the finances for both businesses (I R.T., at 79-81).\nBoth Applicant and H accumulated a number of delinquent debts prior to 1992,\nwhen business conditions deteriorated for both businesses.  Unable to address their\n\n4\ndebts with the resources available to them, Applicant and H petitioned jointly for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy relief in August 1992 (see ex. 2).  In their petition, they scheduled\n$268,000 in secured claims, $6,758 in unsecured priority claims (covering personal and\nproperty taxes), and $236,189 in unsecured, non-priority claims (see ex. 3). Applicant\nand H received their bankruptcy discharge in December 1992.\nFollowing their bankruptcy discharge, Applicant and H accumulated additional\ndelinquent debts they could not resolve with their available income.  H attributes most of\nthese debts to his business failure in 2002.   H accepts personal responsibility for these\ndebts, and for sometimes concealing creditor billings from Applicant to avoid upsetting\nher (see ex. D; I R.T., at 74-80).  Applicant never involved herself in H\u2019s businesses and\nhad only limited knowledge of the debts associated with his businesses.  She and H\nsold their house to cover their debts, but the sale proceeds were insufficient to satisfy all\nof their debt delinquencies.  \nTwo of the listed creditors (creditors 1.b and 1.c) obtained default judgments\nagainst Applicant and H (see exs. 4 through 8). Records show that creditor 1.b obtained\na default judgment in April 2007 in the amount of $4,171. Creditor 1.c obtained a similar\ndefault judgment in May 2007 in the amount of $4,238.\nWhen asked about the initiated lawsuits of these two creditors, scheduled\nhearings, and default judgment entries, H assured that the debts and ensuing\njudgments were his responsibility, and he never kept Applicant informed of litigation\ndevelopments in the two cases (I R.T., at 81-82, 90).  He expressed doubt, in turn, that\nshe was aware of the judgments obtained by the same creditors (I R.T., at 80-81).  \nBased on the presented evidence, neither H nor Applicant mounted any\ndefenses to these creditor 1.b and 1.c suits, and both creditors obtained default\njudgments against Applicant and H (I R.T., at 87-89). These judgments remain\nunsatisfied (see exs. 4 through 8 and A).\nIn an interview with an agent from the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) in\nOctober 1998, Applicant acknowledged her awareness of five debts listed in her credit\nreport since her bankruptcy discharge. Although H seldom apprised her of the details of\nspecific debts, he did keep her generally informed of their debts (I R.T., at 92, 95). \nWhen told by the interviewing DIS agent of two other unpaid credit card accounts\nin her credit report, she denied any knowledge of these accounts.  She told the agent\nthat she apprised her husband of these two debts, and that H told her that the debts\nwere unpaid medical accounts for services furnished their son in 1993-1994 (see ex. 2).\nWithout any supporting documentation, both Applicant and H claimed these bills should\nhave been paid by their insurance company.  Their claims lack probative proof.  \nBesides the two adverse judgments entered against them, Applicant and H\naccumulated six additional debts exceeding $36,000. Credit reports document that\nApplicant and H accrued seven additional debts exceeding $32,000 between 2002 and\n\n5\n2007 (see exs. 5 through 8).  To date, none of these debts have been satisfied.  H\nattributes these joint and several debts to his failed business (I R.T., at 75).  Having\nturned bill-paying responsibilities over to H, Applicant  paid little attention to her bills.  H,\nin turn, neglected Applicant\u2019s joint debts, claiming he was too pressed with his troubled\nfinances of his own businesses to address the debts that directly affected Applicant. \nTo date, Applicant and H have not been able to make any tangible headway in\naddressing their debts listed in the SOR.  H\u2019s exhibits do not reflect any payments or\npayment plans with any of the listed creditors.  H assures he handled all of his family\u2019s\nfinances, and never shared any of his billing details with his wife (I R.T., at 92-93).\nAlthough he made Applicant generally aware of his financial problems associated with\nhis business, he never relinquished control of his direct dealings with the individual\ncreditors. \nBoth H and Applicant were embarrassed over the\u201dunhealthy state\u201d of their\nfinances (I R.T., at 80-81, 97).  H assured that Applicant was generally aware at all\ntimes of their financial problems with their creditors (I R.T., at 80, 95). Applicant\ncorroborated H\u2019s testimony.  \nH claims he has achieved some success in 2008 with a new start-up business (I\nR.T., at 76-77).  With his increased liquidity from his business, he hopes to be able to\naddress his listed delinquent debts (I R.T., at 76).  Applicant and H project their joint\nincome for 2009 to total around $160,000 (see ex. G).  They estimate expenses to total\naround $124,000, and expect to have a net annual remainder of $36,000 (ex. G).  With\ntheir added income, they believe they will be able to pay off all of their remaining debts. \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in February 2008, Applicant omitted both of her two\noutstanding judgments (when answering question 27d) and her debts delinquent more\nthan 180 days in the last seven years, and 90 days currently delinquent.  H prepared\nApplicant\u2019s answers to the financial questions; however, he did so with Applicant\u2019s\nacquiescence and awareness of their delinquent debts (R.T., at 95).  In the certified\nletter Applicant signed and submitted with her accompanying answer in February 2009,\nshe did not question her delinquent debts in issue, and assured she did not realize the\nseriousness of the \u201cfinancial delinquency\u201d caused by H\u2019s business failure.  She felt\n\u201cshame to disclose it\u201d (see February 2009 letter that accompanied her answer in exhibit\nfile).  She affirmed her signature on this letter at her hearing.\nIn addressing his own impressions of Applicant\u2019s awareness of their delinquent\ndebts, H acknowledged that Applicant was embarrassed about their financial situation\nand knew that H had lost \u201ca lot of money\u201d (I R.T., at 97).  He acknowledged, too, that\nApplicant knew that he and Applicant had debts over 180 days delinquent in the past\nseven years and had some debts that were currently over 90 days past due (I R.T., at\n98-99).\nIn her defense, H claimed he prepared the letter and e-QIP answers for her\nsignature (I R.T., at 95-96).  But when asked by Department Counsel whether she was\n\n6\naware of the two judgments and delinquent debts when she signed her e-QIP, and\nfalsely answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions, she initially answered in the affirmative (I R.T., at\n105, 114-15).  When asked for clarification by Department Counsel, she changed her\nanswers first back to \u201cno,\u201d and then to \u201cyes\u201d again (I R.T., at 117, 121-25).\n Before Applicant could answer any more clarification requests from Department\nCounsel, H objected anew that she did not understand the questioning by Department\nCounsel (R.T., at 123-24).  At this point, the hearing was adjourned to afford Applicant\nthe opportunity to obtain a certified translator to assist her in the resumed hearing (I\nR.T., at 127-28).  \nGranted the opportunity to testify on her behalf at the rescheduled hearing,\nApplicant failed to appear.  Based on the documented evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial\nhistory and e-QIP omissions of her judgments and delinquent debts, inferences warrant\nthat Applicant possessed general awareness of her delinquent debts covered in the\nSOR and took no active steps to resolve them, or note any of them in her e-QIP. \nCharacter evidence\nApplicant has been a valued employee of her defense contractor employer.  She\nwas awarded a certificate of service in November 2006 in appreciation of her valued\nservice to the company over the previous 10 years (see ex. F). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommon sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudicative\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\n\n7\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common-sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n\n8\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a former senior technician for a defense contractor with a\nconsiderable history of financial indebtedness.  She and her husband attribute most of\ntheir accrued debts to their business failures (mostly his). Their business failures\nprompted both of them to petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1992. \nFollowing the discharge of their financial responsibilities, H returned to his\nbusiness venture efforts and accumulated more delinquent debts when his business\nfaltered.  Their accrued debts included judgments and accumulated consumer debts they\nhave been unable to resolve. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions of her unsatisfied judgments, debts over 180 days\ndelinquent in the past seven years, and debts currently 90 days delinquent, raise security\nconcerns, too, about her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Applicant was not\nable to credibly explain her omissions before the adjournment of the first scheduled\nhearing.  Because she did not attend the reconvened hearing, she was not able to\nanswer Department Counsel\u2019s questions about her omissions, or otherwise credibly\nprovide any good faith reasons for her omissions.\nApplicant\u2019s finances                                                                  \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of debts through the small company her husband owns\nand manages, her outstanding judgment indebtedness, and their past inability to pay\nthese debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts,\u201d and DC 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to recurrent income shortages following\nher husband\u2019s recurrent business failures.  To date, neither she nor her husband have\nbeen able to address any of their debts in any tangible way.  Without any documented\npayment or resolution of her debts, ascertainment of her payment intentions at this time\ncannot be made without considerable speculation.  \nApplicant does not provide adequate explanations either as to why she has not\nmade more concerted earlier attempts to work out payment arrangements with her\ncreditors. Nor has she provided any convincing justifications for failing to make any\nmaterial attempts  to resolve the two outstanding judgments against her.\n\n9\nMitigation credit to Applicant is very limited based on her furnished proofs. While\nnone of the listed debts are of recent creation, they represent outstanding and continuing\nobligations.  As a result, MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be applied\nto Applicant\u2019 situation.\n Because Applicant has not chosen to seek any counseling advice relative to her\nidentified personal judgments and delinquent debts, she may take no advantage of \u00b6 MC\n20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  \u00b6 MC 20 (d),\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts,\u201d has no applicability either.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required to ensure the\nGovernment\u2019s trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal\nconcern raised by a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability\nto coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit as well in financial\ncases.\nA whole person assessment does not help Applicant to overcome the judgment\nlapses associated with her debt accruals. Her work history with her current employer\ndeserves praise. Her failure, though, to diligently monitor and ensure timely payment\nefforts to her identified judgment holders and other creditors reflects the lack of adequate\nattention to her fiducial duties of meeting her personal debt obligations.  These concerns\nare not mitigated under the whole person concept.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations and the absence of sufficient efforts to demonstrate her financial\nresponsibility and trustworthiness in managing her finances, Applicant does not mitigate\nsecurity concerns related to her proven debt delinquencies.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\nraised under Guideline E as the result of her intentional omissions of her judgments and\ndelinquent debts over 180 days delinquent in the past seven years and debts currently\n90 days delinquent, respectively. By her determined intentional omission of her\noutstanding adverse judgments and delinquent debts, Applicant failed to furnish\nmaterially important information about her finances that was needed for the Government\nto properly process and evaluate her security clearance application.\n\n10\nApplicant\u2019s omissions are not accompanied by any convincing explanations of the\ncircumstances surrounding completion of her e-QIP. Standing alone, without any\ncredible explanations from her testimony to alter her stated reasons for her omissions in\nthe letter she enclosed with her response, the omissions manifestly reflect her conscious\ndecisions to omit material information concerning her outstanding judgments and her\ndelinquent debts. Her hearing answers vacillated between admissions and denials that\ncould not be reconciled before adjourning the hearing. Applicant, in turn, was afforded an\nopportunity to provide additional explanations on her own behalf, but evidently chose not\nto attend the reconvened hearing. \nBased on the inferences drawn of Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions of her\njudgments, her debts over 180 days delinquent in the past seven years, and her debts\ncurrently 90 days delinquent, respectively, the alleged omissions in the SOR are\nconcluded to be proven as stated. \nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions,\nher explanations are insufficient to enable her to convincingly mitigate the deliberate\nfalsification allegations. Questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations are core security concerns of the\npersonal conduct guideline (AG \u00b615).  They are clearly evident under the facts and policy\nconsiderations developed under this Guideline. Overall, Applicant\u2019s omissions reflect\nserious lapses of judgment and trust that are not mitigated by any showing of prompt,\nvoluntary corrections.\nTaking into account all of the evidence produced in this record, unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the Guideline E allegations that Applicant knowingly\nand wilfully omitted her outstanding judgments, her debts more than 180 days delinquent\nin the past seven years, and her debts currently 90 days delinquent, respectively, in the\ne-QIP she completed.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1i:                \n     Against Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.b:\n             \n     Against Applicant\n\n11\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  Clearance is denied. \n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

O\u2019Connell, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn February 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of Applicant eligibility for a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 16, 2009, and elected to have his\ncase decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on April 28, 2009, and timely responded with documented letters to his\ncreditors, employment information and performance evaluations. The case was\nassigned to me on June 3, 2009.   Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings and\nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJune 30, 2009\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 13,\nbankruptcy in November 2001, which was dismissed in September 2002, (b) had a\nfederal tax lien assessed against him in October 2007 in the amount of $8,237.00, and\n\u00a9) accumulated 11 delinquent debts exceeding $13,000.00. \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nadded no explanations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old lab technician for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married in May 1987.  He divorced in September 1991 (see ex. 5).  He\nhas one child from this marriage (see ex. 20).  \nApplicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in November 2001.  Credit\nreports reveal that his Chapter 13 petition was dismissed in September 2002.  Reasons\nfor the dismissal are not reported.  \nRecords show that the Internal Revenue Service Additionally filed a federal tax\nlien against him in 1997 for $8,237.00 in reported delinquent taxes.  The circumstances\nthat necessitated this lien are not covered in the presented evidence.  Between 2001\nand 2002, Applicant accumulated a number of debts that are reported to be delinquent\nin his July 2008 credit report (see ex. 8).  His consumer debts total 10 in number and\nexceed $4,000.00 in amount. Applicant attributes these accrued consumer debts to a\nperiod of unemployment between April 2001 and April 2002, after his employer ceased\ndoing business. He has since returned to work and provides information covering his\ncurrent employment.  Applicant provides copies of letters he recently sent to most of his\ncreditors acknowledging his debts and asking for approval of his offers to begin making\n$25.00 monthly payments on each of his debts. \nApplicant does nor provide any letter responses to his individual requests, or\nfurnish any alternative payment plans should any or all of his creditors decline his offers.\nNor does he provide any explanations or evidence of corrective steps he has taken to\nresolve his outstanding federal tax lien.\nApplicant provided an endorsement from his supervisor commending him on his\nsuccessful completion of his 180-day probationary period and welcoming him as a\nregular employee. Applicant received solid performance evaluations from his supervisor\nwho credited Applicant with exceeding his expectations and demonstrating  outstanding\n\n3\ntechnical and supervisor skills during the 2008 rating period.  Applicant did not include\nany updated 2009 performance evaluations or evidence of community contributions in\nhis response materials.\n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\n\n4\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the  judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose\nof establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation,\nextenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a highly regarded lab technician for a defense contractor who\npetitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy (dismissed) and accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts (to include an unsatisfied federal tax lien). Most of these debts date\nto a period between 2001 and 2002 when Applicant was unemployed. \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to address\nthese debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619\u00a9) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nMany of Applicant\u2019s debts were accumulated during a period of extended\nunemployment between 2001 and 2002, and were covered in his dismissed Chapter\n13 petition in 2002.  Less is known about the filed tax lien in 1997, or what steps\nApplicant took to address this lien or his other debts after he returned to work in April\n2002.  Without more information about his past efforts in addressing his debts and\nplans to resolve his listed debts, Applicant cannot be credited with any manifest\nprogress to date in regaining control of his finances.  Further, he provides no hard\nassurances of any commitment to resolve his debts in the foreseeable future should\n\n5\nany of all of his creditors decline his recent payment offers.  Applicant\u2019s finances still\nrequire a good deal of effort on his part to fully stabilize them. \nBased on his furnished explanations regarding his loss of employment,,\nApplicant may take some advantage of MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations\nguideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibility.\u201d  The lack of more documentation of the specific circumstances\nsurrounding his accumulated debts precludes him from fully utilizing MC \u00b6 20(b) to\nhis benefit. \nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant under any of the other mitigating\nconditions based on the evidence developed in this administrative record.  While he\nable document recent requests to his consumer creditors to approve modest $25.00\na month payments, he provides no creditor responses or alternative plans should\nany of all of the creditors decline to work with him.  And he provides no evidence of\nany efforts to address his still outstanding federal tax lien.\n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his failed Chapter 13 petition and his ensuing\naccumulation of still unresolved delinquent debts.  To his credit, he demonstrates\ngood progress with his recent employer and shows interest in resolving his debts.\nTo date, though, Applicant has not shown sufficient efforts to resolve his\noutstanding debts to overcome security concerns about the state of his finances.  His\nwork recent contributions and solid performance evaluations are encouraging and\ndemonstrate his responsibility in the work place.  But these efforts, while important,\nare not enough to surmount continuing security concerns about his finances.\nConsidering the record as a whole, it is still too soon to make safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to resolve his federal tax lien, repay his old\nconsumer debts, and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his\nholding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.l. \n\n6\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in\nthe context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed\nabove, I make the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.l:\n                Against Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  Clearance is denied. \n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on July 13, 2008, as part of her employment with a defense contractor. On May \n28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 10, 2009. She admitted eight and \ndenied six of the factual allegations under Guideline F, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 6, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on August 12, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on August 13, 2009, for a hearing on September 3, 2009. Applicant signed for \nthe Notice of Hearing on August 18, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ngovernment offered five exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 thru 5, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her behalf and offered 16 \nexhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A thru P which were received without \nobjection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional documents. \nApplicant timely submitted four documents marked App. Ex. Q thru T, which were \nreceived without objection (Gov. Ex. 6, Department Counsel memorandum, dated \nSeptember 29, 2009). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September \n14, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old and has been an administrative assistant for a defense \ncontractor for approximately one year. She is a single mother raising a son. She is \nenrolled in college working towards a degree in accounting (Tr. 53; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, \ndated July 15, 2008). Applicant's present net monthly salary is $2,450.06, with total \nmonthly expenses of $2,295.44, leaving a monthly net remainder of $154.62. Her \nmonthly salary does not take into account overtime pay. She usually averages 15 hours \nof overtime per pay period (Tr. 67-69; App. Ex. N, Personal Financial Statement, dated \nAugust 28, 2009). Applicant provided an updated response to the SOR at the hearing \ndetailing the actions she has taken to resolve and pay her debts (App. Ex. A, Updated \nresponse to statement of reasons, undated). \n \nCredit reports reveal the following delinquent debts for Applicant; a medical \ncollection account for $100 (SOR 1.a); another medical collection account for $100 \n(SOR 1.b); a collection account for a fitness center for $220 (SOR 1.c); a charged off \naccount to a finance company for $220 (SOR 1.d); a charged off account to the same \nfinance agency for $186 (SOR 1.e); a credit card debt charged off for $1,329 (SOR. 1.f); \na collection account for a retail store chain for $697 (SOR 1.g); a collection account for \nanother department store for $358 (SOR 1.h); a mortgage account 90 days past due for \n$1,000 (SOR 1.i); a credit card account charged off for $1,375 (SOR 1.j); an automobile \nloan charge off for $10,465 (SOR 1.k); a medical account in collection for $100 (SOR \n1.l); a cash advance account in collection for $420 (SOR 1.m); and an insurance \naccount in collection for $325 (SOR 1.n; Gov. Ex. 3, Credit report, dated July 29, 2008; \nGov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated January 23, 2009; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated May \n14, 2009).   \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.a and 1.b are medical debts for the care of Applicant's \nson. Both debts have been paid in full (Tr. 17-18, 54; App. Ex. B, Account activity, dated \nAugust 5, 2009; App. Ex. C, Paid in full letter, dated August 31, 2009). \n \nDelinquent debt 1.c is a debt to a ladies fitness center. Delinquent debt 1.d is the \nsame debt listed with a collection agency. Delinquent debt 1.e is a different debt to the \nsame collection agency for the same ladies fitness center for fees from 2002. Applicant \ncontracted with the ladies fitness center to use their facilities for the fee of $29 per \nmonth which she continuously paid. She has no record of the payments she made since \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe payments were over six years ago. Applicant requested verification of the debts \nfrom the collection agency. She was advised that there is no record of a debt for her \nfrom 2002. Applicant used the center and paid her fees until the center went out of \nbusiness. She does not believe she has a balance owed from 2002 until the center \nceased business in 2006. She requested verification of the debt from the collection \nagency. She has not received a response from the collection agency (Tr. 27-32, 55-56; \nApp. Ex. D, Credit reporting agency update, dated August 28, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.f is an account in collection for a credit card. Applicant has an \nagreement with the collection agency for payment of $50 per month on the debt. She \nmade payments of $100 and $50. She is attempting to make a further payment by bank \ndraft but the collection agency is having difficulty with the transaction. The funds are \navailable for withdrawal (Tr. 32-34, 57-58; App. Ex. E, Letter, dated February 26, 2009; \nApp. Ex. Q, Applicant's letter, dated September 17, 2009; App. Ex. T, Bank Statement, \ndated September 17, 2009). \n \nDelinquent debt 1.g has been settled for $361.84 and paid in full (Tr. 34, App. Ex. \nF, Letter and cancelled check, dated June 30, 2009). Delinquent debt SOR 1.h has \nbeen settled for $216.24 and paid in full (Tr. 34, 59; App. Ex. G, letter and bank account \nstatement, dated July 7, 2009). Delinquent debt 1.i is for Applicant's mortgage listed as \n90 days pat due. Applicant restructured her mortgage and it is now current (Tr. 34, 59-\n60; App. Ex. H, Letter, dated August 10, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.j is for a charged off credit card account with a balance of \n$1,598. Applicant has an agreement to pay $75 month until the debt is satisfied. \nApplicant has made payments totaling $475 (Tr. 34-35, 60; App. Ex. I, Letter, dated July \n17, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt 1.k is the remainder on an automobile loan after the car was \nrepossessed. The car was purchased by Applicant and a former boyfriend, the father of \nher child. The boyfriend did not make his share of the payments and the car was \nrepossessed. The actual amount of the debt after Applicant received credit for charges \nthat no longer are applicable is $7,689.91. She received a settled offer of $3,844.96, but \nshe was unable to take advantage of the offer. Applicant reached an agreement with the \ncollection agency to pay $150 monthly until the debt is satisfied. Her first payment was \nmade on August 28, 2009 (Tr. 36-43; App. Ex. J, Check, dated August 28, 2009; App. \nEx. P, Letter, dated January 16, 2009). \n \nDelinquent debt 1.l is for a medical account in collection. Applicant disputed the \ndebt and attempted to research it with the collection agency. She had a medical \ninsurance account that paid her co-pays. The debt may be a duplicate of the debts \nlisted at SOR 1.a and 1.b since they are for the same amount on the same day of \nservice. She paid these debts. The credit reporting agencies have removed the debt \nfrom her credit report. Applicant assumes it was removed because it was determined \nbased on her dispute that the debt was listed in error. It is not listed on her present \ncredit report (Tr. 43-49, 60-61; App. Ex. K, Credit report, dated August 28, 2009). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant disputed the delinquent debt at SOR 1.m. She never had an account \nwith the creditor listed and does not know about any debt owed. The debt has been \nremoved from her credit report by the credit reporting agency because it is either no \nlonger being reported by the creditor or the creditor has directed that it be removed (Tr. \n49-51). \n \nDelinquent debt 1.n is for fees owed to the insurance company on the car that \nwas repossessed in SOR 1.k. Applicant's former boyfriend was to pay the insurance on \nthe car. He provided Applicant with funds for half of the debt. Applicant used her funds \nfor the other half of the debt and paid the debt in full (Tr. 51-52, 61-62, 64-65; App. Ex. \nS, receipt, dated September 11, 2009). \n \nApplicant's performance rating from her employer shows that she is highly \nregarded and was recommended for a salary increase. (App. Ex. L, Employee \nPerformance Review, dated June 25, 2009). A former supervisor for Applicant noted \nthat she is efficient, competent, organized, and has excellent rapport with customers. \nShe has a strong work ethic and is trustworthy and professional (App. Ex. O, letter, \ndated September 1, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are still required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as listed on credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).   \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), \nand FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant is a single mother raising her \n\n \n6 \n \n \nson. The father of her child is required to assist with payment of certain debt but he has \nonly provided limited assistance. However, Applicant has paid some of her debts and \nactively worked with the creditors and credit reporting agencies to resolve her debts. \nShe has demonstrated that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Since she \nis actively working on her delinquent debts, they do not cause doubt concerning her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good-faith effort to pay them. Applicant paid six of the debts, either in full \nor by settlement. One debt, her mortgage, is now current. She is paying three debts \nunder an agreed plan and is current with her payments. She disputed four debts with \nthe creditors or the credit reporting agencies. Two have been removed from her credit \nreports and she is waiting action on the two remaining disputes. She took concrete \naction to address her delinquent debts. Applicant mitigated security concerns based on \nher finances. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Appellant's excellent \nwork evaluation and her reputation with her former supervisor. Appellant must show a \n\"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including evidence of actual debt reduction \nthrough payment of debts. She is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that she \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that she has a plan \n\n \n7 \n \n \nto resolve her financial problems and takes significant action to implement that plan. \nThe entirety of her financial situation and her actions can reasonably be considered in \nevaluating the extent to which her plan to reduce her outstanding indebtedness is \ncredible and realistic. Available, reliable information about the person's behavior, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct \nmay provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment by presenting \nsufficient information to show she paid six of the delinquent debts in full and her \nmortgage payments are current. She has agreements in effect for three other debts and \nher payments under the plans are current. She disputed other accounts and they have \neither been resolved in her favor or she is waiting for the results of the disputes. She \nhas sufficient monthly income to meet her present obligations. Applicant demonstrated \nthat her financial plan to resolve her debts is credible and realistic, and she is managing \nher finances responsibly under the circumstances. The management of her present \nfinances and her past obligations indicates she will be concerned, responsible, and not \ncareless in regard to sensitive information. Appellant is not financially overextended and \nshe is living within her means. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions \nor doubts as to Appellant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She established \nthat she is suitable for a security clearance. I conclude Appellant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from her financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 11, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On March 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 8), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJuly 10, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 30, 2009, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (GE 9). \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 22, 2009. On May 15, 2009, the \ncase was assigned to me. On May 15, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 10). \nThe hearing was held on May 26, 2009. Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-\n6) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20), and Applicant offered eleven exhibits (Tr. 63, 97; AE A-K). \nThere were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 21), and AE A-K (Tr. 63-64, 97). \nAdditionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR, as well \nas a demonstrative exhibit (GE 7-10). I received the transcript on June 2, 2009. I \nreceived 12 post-hearing exhibits, which were admitted without objection as AE L-X. \nApplicant\u2019s cover letter was admitted as AE L1, and the court record she designated as \nAE L was admitted as AE L4. Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s cover letter was admitted as AE X. \nThe description of Applicant\u2019s other post-hearing exhibits is at AE L3.    \n   \nProcedural Matters \n \nDepartment Counsel conceded at the outset of the hearing that there was no \nSOR \u00b6 1.n (Tr. 13). He also agreed with Applicant that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($1,503) and 1.m \n($1,503) are the same debt (Tr. 13).  \n \nApplicant affirmatively waived her right to 15-day\u2019s notice of the date, time and \nlocation of the hearing (Tr. 129-131).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted responsibility for her 2001 bankruptcy \nand the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.e, 1.j and 1.l. She denied and/or disputed the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f to 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p.  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old human systems engineer for a government contractor \n(Tr. 22; GE 1). Her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees are in English (Tr. 23-24). She \ntaught high school for 15 years (Tr. 24). In 1993, she was unemployed for about six \nmonths (Tr. 66-67). She earned a Juris Doctor degree, but did not pass the bar \nexamination (Tr. 110). She earned a Ph.D in Management Information Systems (Tr. 23). \nShe has focused in human factors in industrial systems engineering (Tr. 23). She has \nbeen a federal employee for several years (Tr. 24). She has never served in the U.S. \nmilitary (GE 1).

She became unemployed on July 1, \n2006 (Tr. 26-27). She sent out hundreds of resumes a month (Tr. 104). She was mostly \nunemployed for the next two years (Tr. 27). For example, she tried to become an \narbitrator and an administrator. However, she was unsuccessful at obtaining \nemployment (Tr. 104-105). She had some part-time work as a substitute teacher (Tr. \n27).  \n \nApplicant married in 1972 and divorced in 1976 (Tr. 109). She has not remarried \n(Tr. 109-110). Her twins were born in October 2004 (Tr. 28). She has not sought or \nreceived any child support payments from the father of her children (Tr. 110, 114). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts of about $40,000 were discharged through a Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy in 2001 (Tr. 32, 66; SOR \u00b6 1.a). Her security clearance application indicates \nshe traveled to Italy and Israel for religious reasons in the summer of 2000 (GE 1; Tr. \n69-70). She filed for bankruptcy three months later (Tr. 69-70). She explained the trip to \nItaly and Israel was fairly inexpensive with the airfare costing about $300 (Tr. 71).  \n \nApplicant cited her personal financial problems in connection with the failure of \nher incorporated business as the primary reason for her 2001 bankruptcy. Applicant \nstarted an internet business, which she incorporated (Tr. 33-36; AE C). She invested \nabout $20,000 in the business, which she charged on her credit cards (Tr. 64, 66). She \nthought she would receive financing for the business from her partner (Tr. 33). \nUltimately, the business was dissolved. She also had some non-business related \nexpenses. For example, she borrowed money for school/education expenses (Tr. 68).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (2002 judgment for $1,592; AE D) possibly relates to a former landlord \nseeking additional rent (Tr. 36-39). She thought the creditor was asserting that Applicant \ndid not pay all of her rent (Tr. 36). The number on the credit report did not match the \nnumber on the judgment information she received from the clerk of court (Tr. 72-76). \nHowever, the names of the creditors on the documentation are similar (Tr. 76). \nApplicant believed she paid her rent (Tr. 36). The creditor she thought held the debt did \nnot respond to her inquiry (Tr. 77). The state court record indicates there was a filing by \nthe creditor but no judgment (Tr. 36-39; AE D at 2). The record indicates non-suit. Id. \nShe assumes at this point the debt is resolved and she is not paying anything on this \njudgment (Tr. 76, 79). The file does not contain a copy of the judgment itself. Applicant \nalso looked for the judgment and was not able to find it (Tr. 111). Her attorney checked \nwith the attorneys for both apartment complexes where Applicant lived and they did not \nfile any judgments (Ex. L at 1). Applicant\u2019s attorney conducted an additional search for \nthe judgment with the pertinent state court without locating it (AE L at 1, AE M). If the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is established, she promised to pay it (Tr. 78).    \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($11,672) and 1.d ($5,117) relate to medical bills for Applicant\u2019s \nsons\u2019 treatment shortly after they were delivered by C-section2 in October 2004 (Tr. 40, \n85-86). Applicant had medical insurance coverage through her employer\u2019s policy; \nhowever, dispute between the hospital and her insurance company about whether the \nhospital was an authorized provider for neonatal care delayed payment (Tr. 40). Her \nmedical insurance provider eventually paid most of the medical bill (AE N, AE O). She \nmade several inquiries about the basis for the charges not covered by her insurance \ncompany and the rationale for the failure of the hospital and insurance company to \nresolve or clarify responsibility for the remainder of the charges (Tr. 41-43). She wanted \nan \u201cExplanation of Benefits\u201d from the provider (Tr. 89-90). She did not retain any \ndocumentation about the dispute, except for a bill (Tr. 88-90). Her disputing \ncommunications were mostly phone-call based (Tr. 88). On May 21, 2009, Applicant \nentered into a payment plan with the creditor to pay $500 monthly (Tr. 44-45; AE E). \nShe made the first $500 payment towards a debt of about $16,000 (Tr. 86-87). After the \nhearing, Applicant obtained and provided a phone log from the creditor, describing her \ncontacts with the creditor (AE L, M). Applicant provided documentation showing she \ndisputed her liability for payments exceeding her medical insurance (AE L at 1; AE N, \nAE O).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($140) relates to a medical bill (Tr. 45). Applicant settled the debt for \n$112 and paid it (Tr. 45-46, 94; AE J at 1; AE L at 2).   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($955) and 1.g ($490) relate to medical bills from the same creditor \n(Tr. 46). Applicant believed her medical insurance covered the bills (Tr. 47). Her \ncompany changed providers and the doctor refused to re-submit the bills (Tr. 47). Then \nthe debts were too old to re-submit (Tr. 48). She is on good terms with her doctor (Tr. \n48). She asked him for a release of the debt on May 25, 2009 (Tr. 96). The debts were \nremoved from her credit report (Tr. 48-49, 96; AE K; AE L at 2).  After the hearing, \nApplicant provided a letter from the creditor indicating the debts were satisfied and they \nwere erroneously sent to the credit reporting company (AE Q).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($64) for an electric bill was paid (Tr. 49-50; AE B; AE L at 2; AE R). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($1,503) and 1.m ($1,503) are duplications of each other (Tr. 50). The \ntwo items relate to rent for an apartment (Tr. 50). Initially she disputed the debt because \nshe believed she gave adequate notice and there was no basis for the debt (Tr. 50-51). \nShe contacted the creditor and settled the debt for $766.85 and paid it (Tr. 51-54; AE J \nat 2; AE S). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($258) and 1.o ($233) are duplications of each other (Tr. 58-59). They \npertain to a leftover utility debt from an apartment (Tr. 54-55). The bill was sent to an old \naddress and Applicant did not receive it (Tr. 55).

On May 13, 2009, Applicant paid \nthis debt (Tr. 57; AE G).   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($6,442) was discharged in her 2001 bankruptcy (Tr. 57; Ex. H). \nApplicant\u2019s discharge from liability was reported to the IRS on a form 1099-C (Ex. H). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p pertains to missing four payments on her mortgage of $294,000. \nApplicant purchased a residence in January 2006 for $302,000 (Tr. 28, 97-98). Her \nmonthly mortgage payment was $2,912 (Tr. 98). At the time she purchased her \nresidence, the federal government employed her and she had an annual salary of \n$93,000 (Tr. 28). She became unemployed on July 1, 2006 (Tr. 98). She withdrew funds \nfrom her savings and 401K accounts to pay her mortgage (Tr. 29, 103). She fell behind \non her payments in December 2007 (Tr. 29). She called the mortgage creditor and \ninformed the creditor that she was unemployed and she could only make one more \npayment (Tr. 29). In February 2008, she received a loan from the FHA, and from the \nHome Saver Advance, which permitted her to re-start her mortgage payments in \nFebruary 2009 (Tr. 30). She made four additional payments. As indicated previously, \nher current employment with the contractor began in June 2008 (Tr. 30). On May 13, \n2009, she received a forbearance agreement from the creditor, which provided that her \nmonthly payment was reduced to $2,015 for the months of April to June 2009 (Tr. 31, \n59; AE I). She made her payments in April, May and June 2009 (Tr. 59; AE I; AE L at 2; \nAE U; AE V; AE W). She hopes to receive a payment reduction schedule, which will \npermit her to keep her mortgage payments current.  \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling (Tr. 74). Her current annual salary is \n$75,000 (Tr. 100). Her monthly take-home pay (after taxes are deducted) is about \n$4,500 (Tr. 101). She has the following monthly expenses: mortgage ($2,015); daycare \n($1,305); utilities ($90); car payment ($344); car insurance ($80); groceries ($200); and \ncell phone ($20) (Tr. 102-103, 106). She now has a monthly $500 payment on her \nmedical debt and has three small monthly credit card payments, totaling about $50 (Tr. \n105). She has had her student loans deferred; however, she has recently resumed \npayments (Tr. 108). She begins paying her FHA home saver advance in June 2009, \nwhich amounts to $153 per month (Tr. 108-109). \n \nApplicant purchased a car in 2004, and it is almost paid off (Tr. 81). Over the last \nthree years, she tried to stay in touch with her creditors and she increased her efforts to \nresolve her debts after an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed her (Tr. 89-90).  \n \nThe only financial problem Applicant disclosed on her 2008 security clearance \napplication was that she had fallen behind on her mortgage (GE 1). She explained she \nwas either unaware of her debts, she disputed the validity of her debts, or she was \nworking on settlements (Tr. 90-92). The SOR did not allege falsification of her security \nclearance application as a security concern. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nCharacter References \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security officer writes that Applicant \u201chas been an ideal employee\u201d \n(AE A at 2). He describes her as reliable, trustworthy, punctual, and dedicated to \naccomplishing the company\u2019s goals and objectives (Tr. 60; AE A at 2).   \n \nA Reverend Monsignor, who is also Applicant\u2019s cousin, attests to Applicant\u2019s \npersonal character, integrity and honesty. She has strong leadership skills, profound \ngenerosity, and solid ethical standards (Tr. 61; AE A at 3). \n \nAnother Reverend Monsignor has known Applicant since 1971 (Tr. 62; AE A at \n4). He describes her as trustworthy, honest and conscientious. Three of her greatest \nqualities are her tenacity, perseverance and determination.  \n \nA retired U.S. Navy Captain, who was a chaplain on active duty, has known \nApplicant for more than 25 years (Tr. 62-63; AE A at 5). He lauded her commitment \ntowards self-improvement as shown by her academic accomplishments. She is faithful \nto the government, trustworthy, honest and forthright.    \n      \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and, \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n.  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debt is documented in her credit reports (GE 4 and 5), in her SOR response \n(GE 9) and by her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors were \npaid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n   \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent \ndebts. Her delinquent debts are sufficiently recent to constitute, \u201ca continuing course of \nconduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because her financial problems \nbefore her 2001 bankruptcy resulted from the failure of her business. In July 2006 she \nwas unemployed and underemployed for a substantial period. After she received \nemployment in her current position in June 2008, she worked hard to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. She paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m and 1.o. She \nhas her medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d in a payment plan, and her mortgage is \ncurrent (SOR \u00b6 1.p). She receives substantial mitigating credit because her delinquent \ndebts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur and [her \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n   \n                                           \nbehavior] does not cast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d She credibly promised to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, if it is valid.3    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant received financial counseling, and there are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d for the reasons stated \nin the preceding paragraph. She understands the security implications of delinquent \ndebt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. She has also established some, \nbut not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because she showed some, recent good faith4 \nin the resolution of her SOR debts. \n \nApplicant provided documentation contesting the validity of the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.f, 1.g and 1.l. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to these four debts. She disputed the debt in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, and then when she was satisfied that the debts were legitimate, \nshe began making payments. Her overall recent conduct with her creditors shows she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.5  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Nevertheless, she established the full \n \n3 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and \nestablishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of \ndocumentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this Applicant\u2019s \nclearance is conditional.  \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n5\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd.

A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \napplicability of AG \u00b6 20(c). Moreover, security concerns are fully mitigated under the \n\u201cWhole Person Concept,\u201d infra at pages 9-11.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. She fell \nbehind on her debts in 2000, and her debts were discharged in 2001 under Chapter 7 of \nthe Bankruptcy Code. From 2004 to 2006, several debts became delinquent. In June \n2008, she began her present employment with an annual salary of $75,000. She should \nhave made greater progress on her debts. She essentially admitted responsibility for the \nmajority of her SOR debts, her bankruptcy and missing payments on her mortgage. She \nshowed some effort in 2008 and 2009 to resolve her delinquent debts, but could have \nacted more aggressively to pay her delinquent debts, to seek debt repayment or \nresolution, and to better document her remedial efforts. These factors show some \nfinancial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. Her history of delinquent debt raises \nsufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. She is a law-abiding citizen. Her current \nfinancial problems were caused by several factors somewhat beyond her control: (1) \nfailed business enterprise in 2000; (2) business downturn reducing real estate values; \n(3) medical bills related to the birth of her sons; (4) unemployment, and (5) \nunderemployment. In July 2006, she lost her federal employment and she was \nunemployed and/or underemployed for a substantial period. After she received \nemployment in her current position in June 2008, she worked hard to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. She disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.l. She paid the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m and 1.o. She has her medical debts in SOR \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d in a payment plan, and her mortgage is current. See SOR \u00b6 1.p. She has \nthree small credit card debts which are current. Her car payment is current. The Appeal \nBoard has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases \nstating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u2018 . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u2019 The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his [or her] \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) \n(\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

She has a reasonable \nbudget and has begun to achieve financial stability. She understands what she needs to \ndo to establish and maintain her financial responsibility. Clearly, she could have acted \nmore aggressively to resolve her debts, after receiving employment with a government \ncontractor. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payments. In the future, she will act \naggressively to validate her debts. She has promised to pay her valid debts. See note 3, \nsupra. I found her hearing statement to be candid, forthright and credible. Applicant has \ndemonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through her service to the \nDepartment of Defense as a contractor and formerly as a government employee. Her \ncharacter witness statements describe her as a model employee. They laud her \nresponsibility, trustworthiness and integrity.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has sufficiently \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns.    \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.m:    \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n For Applicant (no subparagraph in SOR) \nSubparagraphs 1.o and 1.p: \n For Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains 11 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.k.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nine of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.); he denied two allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.j. and 1.k.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 32-41.) Applicant is 37 years old and employed as a physical security specialist by a government contractor. Since 1998, he has been continuously employed in security work and has worked for three different employers. When he took his current job in 2008, Applicant accepted pay that was slightly lower than what he had earned in his previous job because he wanted to work in a new area of security and develop new skills. (Ex. 1; Tr. 24-27.) Applicant, who is married, is the father of two children. He and his wife are the parents of a five-year-old son. Applicant is also the father of a 14-year-old son who does not live in his household. Applicant pays child support of $352 a month to the mother of his 14-year-old son. (Tr. 47, 49.)

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on May 2, 2008. On April 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 20, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2009. \nAugust 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nI convened a hearing on July 13, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called no witnesses and introduced four exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 \nthrough 4 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf.  He introduced no exhibits and called no witnesses.  \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one week, until close of \nbusiness July 20, 2009, so that Applicant could provide additional information for the \nrecord.  Applicant timely filed one exhibit for the record, which I marked as Ex. A, and \nadmitted to the record, without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on July 17, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 11 allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.k.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nnine of the allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.); he denied two allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.j. and 1.k.).  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 32-41.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and employed as a physical security specialist by a \ngovernment contractor. Since 1998, he has been continuously employed in security \nwork and has worked for three different employers. When he took his current job in \n2008, Applicant accepted pay that was slightly lower than what he had earned in his \nprevious job because he wanted to work in a new area of security and develop new \nskills. (Ex. 1; Tr. 24-27.)   \n \n \nApplicant, who is married, is the father of two children. He and his wife are the \nparents of a five-year-old son. Applicant is also the father of a 14-year-old son who does \nnot live in his household. Applicant pays child support of $352 a month to the mother of \nhis 14-year-old son. (Tr. 47, 49.) \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s father died. Applicant paid his father\u2019s debts, and, in doing \nso, failed to pay his own debts. He became financially overextended. In 2003, Applicant \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; he identified debts of $9,900 and assets of about $1,500. \nThe bankruptcy court discharged his debts in December 2003. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.; Answer to \nSOR; Tr. 27-29.) \n \n \nIn 2004 or 2005, Applicant and his wife separated, and, in 2005 or 2006, \nApplicant purchased a home with another woman. Applicant and the woman moved into \nthe home and were jointly responsible for two mortgages placed on the property. The \ntwo mortgages totaled approximately $300,000. Applicant and the woman lived in the \nhome together for about three months. Then, they ended their relationship, Applicant \nmoved out of the home, and he had no further contact with the woman. The mortgages \nwere not paid, and the property went into foreclosure. Applicant made no effort to \ncontact the mortgage lenders to arrange payment or to discuss forbearance. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f. and 1.g.; Tr. 29-34, 51-52.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant resumed his relationship with his wife, and he continued to experience \nfinancial difficulties. In addition to the two unpaid mortgages, Applicant admitted the \nfollowing debts in collection status: a cell phone debt of $981 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.); a debt of \n$3,107 to a creditor he could no longer identify (SOR \u00b6 1.d.); a debt of $981 to a \ncollection agency (SOR \u00b6 1.h.);1 and an unpaid account of $11,981 (SOR \u00b6 1.i.). He had \nneither responded to nor contacted these creditors, and he had made no payments on \nthe debts. (Tr. 34-41.) \n \n \nApplicant also admitted the following debts in charged-off status: charges of \n$1,026 for bad checks written to a bank account (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) and $11,911 owed to a \ncreditor for failure to timely pay an automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e.).2 He stated he had not \nmade contact with the creditors to pay the debts or arrange payment plans. (Tr. 35-37, \n40-41.) \n \n \nApplicant denied a $183 medical debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j. and claimed he had \npaid the debt. However, he failed to provide documentation to corroborate payment. (Tr. \n41-42.) \n \n \nApplicant also denied a debt of $3,727, which was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he claimed the debt had been discharged in his 2003 bankruptcy. \nAt his hearing, he averred that the debt may not have been discharged in his \nbankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 2008 showed the delinquent account was \nopened in May 2007. He acknowledged he had not contacted the creditor for \nclarification of the status of the debt. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 4 at 6; Tr. 42-43.) \n \n \nApplicant stated he had sought a second job to earn money to pay off his \ndelinquent debts. He said he had been searching for a second job for over a year, with \nno success. Applicant also made an application for a debt consolidation loan, but he \nwas denied because he had so many debts. (Tr. 35-36, 44-45.) \n \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant reported that his net monthly \nincome was $1,840. He reported net monthly expenses of $1,442 and a net monthly \nremainder of $400.  (Ex. 2 at 4; Tr. 46-47.)   \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant reported that he and his wife had separated again in \nMay or June of 2009. Applicant and his wife no longer live together, and they are \nplanning to divorce. Applicant now rents an apartment. Since the recent separation, he \nis responsible for paying half of the monthly support for his five-year-old son, an amount \nhe estimates to be approximately $400. With this new child care expense for his \nyounger son, he no longer has a net monthly remainder. (Tr. 48-49, 54-55.) \n \n \n1 This debt appears to duplicate the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Ex. 4 at 4; Tr. 39-40.) \n \n2 Applicant stated that this debt duplicated the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i. He identified this as an \nautomobile loan that he was delinquent in paying. He stated that he still had possession of the \nautomobile. (Tr. 36, 39, 40-41.)   \n\n \n4 \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s Deputy Program Manager and Quality Assurance Manager provided \na joint letter of character reference for the record. They praised Applicant\u2019s dedication to \nduty, attention to detail, and \u201cimpressive display of skill and knowledge\u201d in carrying out \nhis work assignments. They noted that he took initiative and responsibility for additional \nassignments, exhibited professionalism, and was a valued member of the company\u2019s   \nteam.  (Ex. A.) \n \n                                                           Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n5 \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Additionally, under AG \u00b6 19(e) security concerns are raised when an \napplicant demonstrates \u201cconsistent spending beyond [his] means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d Applicant, who has a history of not \nmeeting his financial obligations, incurred substantial delinquent debt and was unable or \nunwilling to pay his creditors. These facts are sufficient to raise the three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions identified above. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties that spanned the period from   \nSeptember 2003, when he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, to the present time. Applicant \nused the legal tool of bankruptcy for relief from the debts he incurred when he paid his \nfather\u2019s debts. However, he did not manage his financial affairs responsibly after he \nreceived the fresh start provided by the discharge of his debts.  \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed in full-time work in the security \nindustry since 1998. His net income from his full-time job was approximately $1,840 a \nmonth. He admitted that nine of the ten delinquencies alleged on the SOR remained \nunresolved, resulting in substantial debt which continues to the present day, a situation \nwhich raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good judgment. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to support his assertion that his medical debt had been satisfied. \n \nHowever, it should also be noted that the record supports a conclusion that two \ndebts alleged on the SOR are duplicates. Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 2008 supports \na conclusion that the $981 cell phone debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h. duplicates the $978 \ncell phone debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. Additionally, the record also supports a \nconclusion that the $11,911 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i. duplicates the $11,911 debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. \n   \n \nAlthough Applicant sought a consolidation loan as a way to manage his debt, he \nwas turned down because his debts were high and numerous. He did not seek any \nother means of debt resolution or counseling. He did not contact his creditors to arrange \npayment or settlement of his debts. While he did not dispute his debts and admitted that \nhe was responsible for them, it was not clear that he understood his financial problems \nor how to resolve them. He had no plan in place to systematically resolve his substantial \ndelinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 \n20(b), AG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d), and AG 20(e) do not apply in mitigation to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nseveral years ago and are long-standing. He has not taken affirmative action to pay or \nresolve the majority of his delinquent debts, and his many delinquencies and his lack of \nattention to them continue to raise security concerns. He has been continuously \nemployed in the security industry since 1998. In 2005 or 2006, he made personal \ndomestic choices, purchased a home with a person with whom he had a relationship, \nincurred substantial mortgage debt, and then terminated the relationship and his joint \nresponsibility to pay the mortgage debt. Additionally, he failed to provide evidence of \npayment for any of the other debts alleged on the SOR.  Despite a steady income for \nseveral years, he failed to budget his income to satisfy his many debts.

On April 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns\narising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on May 6, 2009, Applicant admitted three of the seven\nallegations set forth in the SOR and declined to request a hearing on the record.\nDepartment Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), dated June 26,\n2009, that included 11 attached items. Applicant received the FORM on July 7, 2009.\nHe responded to the FORM within the 30 days provided by submitting a letter and two\ndocuments. On August 18, 2009, the Director, DOHA, forwarded the case for\nassignment to an administrative judge for administrative determination. I was assigned\nAugust 31, 2009\n\n These checks constitute the down payment and first month\u2019s payment under the agreement.\n      1\n2\nthe case on the following day. Based upon a review of the case file, submissions, and\nexhibits, I find Applicant met his burden regarding the security concerns raised. Security\nclearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old lead repair and refurbishment technician. He has\nworked for the same defense contractor since 2006. He retired from the military after 20\nyears of service and is currently an inactive reservist. Married for over 30 years, he and\nhis wife have three adult children. He did not attend school beyond the high school\nlevel.\nIn about March 1995, Applicant and his wife jointly filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy protection. Their case was brought to a successful close and their trustee\ndischarged the case in January 2001. Later that year, in about July 2001, he took out a\nloan and purchased a vehicle for approximately $17,500. \nIn 2003, Applicant was laid off from his job. He collected unemployment for\nabout nine months. During this time, he became late on his car payments, the interest\nrate was raised, and the automobile was ultimately repossessed. Shortly thereafter, in\nJanuary 2004, Applicant\u2019s son was killed in an automobile accident. As his son lacked\ninsurance, Applicant fell behind on his own bills while paying for his son\u2019s funeral-\nrelated costs. \nIn 2007, the creditor sold or transferred Applicant\u2019s automobile loan account with\nan approximate balance of $10,000 remaining. When completing an e-QIP during a\nperiodic reinvestigation in 2008, Applicant disclosed the repossession of the automobile\nand the balance owed on the loan. He also disclosed that he had been subject to wage\ngarnishments by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). No other financial difficulties were\nnoted. \nIn the late spring or summer of 2009, Applicant and the holder of the automobile\nloan account entered into an agreement under which a $2,350 down payment and\nmonthly payments of $300 would ultimately satisfy a settlement account balance of\n$4,275.34. The promised due date for the down payment was June 29, 2009. Applicant\nsubmitted a copy of this agreement in his response to the FORM. He also submitted\ncopies of checks written between June 21, 2009, and July 29, 2009, amounting to\napproximately $2,650.1\nAside from the bankruptcy action noted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a and car\nrepossession noted in \u00b6 1.f, the SOR notes four delinquent accounts: \n\n Response to SOR at 4/9.\n      2\n Id. at 5/9.\n      3\n Id. at 8/9.\n      4\n Id. at 6-7/9.\n      5\n Response to FORM, Cover letter, dated Aug. 1, 2009.\n      6\n Id.\n      7\n3\n\u00b6 1.b, a $515 indebtedness placed for collection. Applicant provided evidence that this\naccount was settled and paid in January 2009.2\n\u00b6 1.c, a $116 indebtedness placed for collection. A check for $116 was drafted and sent\nto the creditor on February 9, 2009.3\n\u00b6 1.e, a $127 indebtedness placed for collection. Payment of $126.91 was paid by\ncredit card by telephone at some time prior to August 3, 2009. Applicant detailed both\nthe telephone number and a confirmation number for the transaction.\n\u00b6 1.g, a $309 indebtedness placed for collection. A check for $123.71 was drafted and\nsent to the creditor on or about February 9, 2009.4\nFinally, SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d states that there is a past due balance of approximately\n$1,568 owed to Applicant\u2019s mortgagor. The total mortgage amount is about $83,200.\nApplicant showed that the account is now current with no past due balance owed.5\nApplicant concedes he has \u201cmade some poor judgments on [his] finances in the\npast and just want[s] a fresh start. In the past, [he has] signed for government\nequipment worth millions of dollars and never even considered engaging in illegal acts\nto generate funds to pay [his] debts. [He is] a very honest and trustworthy person on the\njob and [his] everyday life.\u201d  He concludes by noting that he \u201cmade a promise to\n6\n[him]self that [he] will never live beyond [his] means and never let this happen again.\u201d7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nAn administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number\nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      8\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      10\n Id.\n      11\n Id.\n      12\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      13\n4\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government must present evidence to establish controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n8\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n9\n10\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the United States Government based on trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nUnited States Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of\nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The\n12\ndecision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of an applicant.  Nor does it reflect badly on that person\u2019s character. It is\n13\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      14\n5\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.14\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nApplicant admitted he filed for bankruptcy protection in the 1990s and that he\nmore recently incurred some delinquent debts. Such facts are sufficient to raise security\nconcerns under financial considerations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d). With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nIn relying on an administrative determination, an applicant restricts review of his\nor her case to the FORM and the applicant\u2019s own submissions. Here, Applicant\nsupplied significant information concerning his protracted period of unemployment in\n2003 and the death of his son in 2004. The facts show that these events gave rise to a\nsignificant portion of the debt at issue, the automobile loan balance, and that Applicant\notherwise tried to stay current on his obligations. Consequently, financial considerations\nmitigating condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d)\nand FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) apply. \nAlthough Applicant failed to provide information as to whether he has received\nfinancial counseling, he has clearly shown that his mortgage is now current, that he\nnegotiated a settlement concerning his automobile loan balance, and that he has paid\nthe largest of the four remaining, relatively minor, obligations. Evidence of far lesser\nweight, such as copies of checks which reveal no signs of having been negotiated or\n\n Copies of checks and money orders which have not been negotiated do not, by themselves, demonstrate\n      15\nactual payment. Similarly, contact telephone and payment confirmation numbers do not establish actual\npayment.\n6\nconfirmation numbers for telephonic payments purportedly made, suggest, but do not\nnecessarily prove, that he also paid most of the approximately $552 represented by the\nremaining three obligations and has made progress in repaying his automobile loan\nbalance.  FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for\n15\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control\u201d) and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) apply. No other FC MCs apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature man who has raised a family and devoted the majority of\nhis adult life to military service. Applicant lacks both a high school diploma and a\nbackground in finance. His written argument, however, is plain and straightforward. \nMultiple facts speak in Applicant\u2019s favor. He refrained from filing for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in favor of Chapter 13 protection when he faced financial problems in the\nearly 1990s. He successfully paid off his share of those debts in under six years.\nDespite the clean slate provided by the discharge of his 1995 bankruptcy petition, a\nprotracted period of unemployment and a sudden family tragedy struck in the mid-\n2000s, helping to create most of the financial issues set forth in the SOR. He has made\n\n A more financially savvy applicant could have provided a receipt from the creditor or a copy of either his\n      16\nbank statement or ATM screen showing that the checks referenced successfully cleared his bank.\n Had Applicant not submitted these documents, I conclude the result would remain the same given the\n      17\nApplicant\u2019s honesty, diligence, and significant progress, as discussed above.\n7\nconsiderable progress on those issues and has vowed to live within his means in the\nfuture. In requesting an administrative determination, however, he chose to carry his\nburden regarding the allegations by presenting limited facts and often imperfect\nsupporting documentation. \nIn issuing the SOR, DOHA relied upon seven derogatory entries on Applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports. Three of those entries are significant in terms of the amounts of money\npotentially at issue: a 15-year-old bankruptcy petition, an auto loan balance, and a past\ndue amount on a mortgage of approximately $83,200. Combined, they are sufficient to\nraise security concerns. Applicant provided clear evidence, however, that his\nbankruptcy petition was successfully discharged, that he negotiated a settlement on his\nautomobile loan balance, and that his mortgage payments are now current with no past\ndue amounts owed. With regard to the four remaining debts, which cumulatively\nrepresent only about $1,000, he provided solid proof that payment on one of those\ndebts was successfully completed. These facts alone demonstrate significant progress,\nparticularly in light of Applicant\u2019s line of work.\nApplicant also endeavored to prove that he paid the three remaining nominal\ncreditors and made significant progress on the automobile loan settlement. With a\nlimited education and unaware of the exacting standards of proof expected by the\nAppeal Board, he introduced copies of drafted checks and confirmation numbers for\ntelephonic payments, seemingly unaware that such documentation cannot establish\nactual receipt and payment without process for verification well beyond the scope and\nresources of this review.  While there are no allegations of fraud or dubious personal\n16\nconduct, such documents can do little more than fortify his written expression of resolve\nto honor his debts and live within his means.  When taken in tandem with the\n17\ncircumstances giving rise to these debts, the significant progress noted above, and the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d analyzed herein, however, Applicant has substantially mitigated financial\nconsiderations security concerns. Therefore, I conclude it is clearly consistent with\nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nARTHUR E.

An Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant on June 9, 2008, and Applicant falsely denied \nusing marijuana after June 2001. On June 16, 2008, he admitted his extensive \nmarijuana use to the OPM investigator. He mitigated security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement because his drug abuse was not recent. However, personal conduct \nconcerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 2, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and \nJanuary 8, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nmodified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nThe June 30, 2009, SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol \nconsumption) and E (personal conduct) (HE 2). On July 30, 2009, Applicant responded \nto the June 30, 2009, SOR and requested a hearing (HE 3). With the consent of the \nApplicant, the government withdrew the June 30, 2009, SOR and issued an amended \nSOR on August 13, 2009 (Transcript (Tr. 14); HE 4). The amended SOR alleged \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and E (personal conduct) (HE \n4). The amended SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the amended SOR allegations on August 21, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on September 15, 2009. On \nOctober 22, 2009, the case was assigned to me. On November 13, 2009, the hearing \nnotice was issued, and his hearing was held on December 16, 2009 (HE 1). Department \nCounsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) (Transcript (Tr.) 15-16), and Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits (Tr. 11). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 16). \nAdditionally, I attached the Hearing Notice, SOR, response to the SOR, amended SOR, \nand response to the amended SOR to the record (HE 1-5). I received the transcript on \nDecember 28, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted the amended SOR allegations in his response to the \namended SOR, except for SOR \u00b6 2.a (HE 5). His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and has worked for a government contractor as a \nresearcher for about 26 months (Tr. 7, 18; GE 1). He is a high school graduate and \ncompleted about two years of college (Tr. 7). He majored in chemical engineering (Tr. \n8). He has never served in the U.S. military (GE 1). He does not hold a security \nclearance (Tr. 7). He has never been married, and does not have any children (GE 1). \n \nMarijuana use \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant said he frequently used \nmarijuana sometimes more than once per day; on other times, he used marijuana a few \ntimes per week from 1995 to June 2007 (Tr. 19; GE 2 at 2). In June 2007, he left the \nstate where he used marijuana and moved in with his parents (Tr. 19; GE 2 at 2). He \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nalso ended his marijuana use (Tr. 19; GE 2 at 2). Applicant\u2019s most extensive and recent \nmarijuana use was associated with his playing in a band. He stopped using marijuana \nbecause he left the band, and he recognized that marijuana use was limiting him from \naccomplishing his professional goals (Tr. 20). In the past, he has purchased marijuana \nor received it from friends (Tr. 21). Applicant has never been convicted of any drug \noffenses.   \n \n \nApplicant still associates with some marijuana users, who are his friends (Tr. 20, \n27-28). He also associates with his brother who uses marijuana (Tr. 20, 27). However, \nafter June 2007, they have not used marijuana in his presence (Tr. 28).  \n \nOxycontin abuse \n \n \nIn March 2001, Applicant injured his knee (Tr. 21). He received a prescription for \none or two 20 milligram Oxycontin pills per day to address pain from knee surgery (Tr. \n21; GE 2 at 2). He used three or four Oxycontin pills every day until July 2001, \nexceeding his prescription\u2019s limitations (Tr. 21; GE 2 at 2). He said he abused Oxycontin \nbecause he was depressed about his injury, the loss of a relationship with his girlfriend, \nand \u201cbeing stupid\u201d (Tr. 22). \n \nTherapy \n \n \nFrom 2002 to 2003, Applicant received education and therapy in connection with \nhis alcohol consumption and marijuana use (GE 2 at 7). His education and therapy \nprogram ended with a successful prognosis on October 14, 2003 (GE 2 at 7). His \nemployer does not conduct urinalysis-drug testing for employees (Tr. 33).   \n  \nFalse statements \n \nIn 1997, Applicant was arrested for marijuana possession (Tr. 22). He was \ncharged with and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in March \n1999 and December 2000 (Tr. 23-24; GE 2 at 5).  \n \nOn November 2, 2007, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application \n(SF-86).2 In response to questions concerning prior alcohol-related charges and \nconvictions, Applicant said in December 2000, he was charged with DUI. He pleaded \nguilty and received probation. In April 2001, he was charged with driving with a \nsuspended license. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to thirty days in jail. He did \nnot disclose his 1997 arrest for marijuana possession or his 1998 DUI conviction \nbecause he misread the question (Tr. 23-24). He thought it asked for alcohol or drug \nrelated charges or convictions in the last seven years (Tr. 23-24).  \n \nIn response to questions concerning alcohol-related treatment, he disclosed that \nhe attended court-ordered alcohol education from about April 2001 to September 2001 \n \n2Applicant\u2019s November 2, 2007, SF-86 is the source for all of the facts in this paragraph and the \nnext paragraph, unless another citation is provided. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(Tr. 24). He disclosed his marijuana use during this therapy program (Tr. 25). In \nresponse to questions about illegal drug use in the last seven years, Applicant \nresponded, \u201cNo\u201d and did not list any marijuana use. He conceded his answer to the \nquestion about previous drug use was deliberately false (Tr. 25).  \n \nAn OPM investigator interviewed Applicant on June 9, 2008.3 The OPM \ninvestigator asked Applicant about the medical records generated during his alcohol \ntreatment sessions (GE 2 at 6). Applicant repeatedly told the OPM investigator that he \ndid not use marijuana after June 2001, and the medical records would not show any \ncurrent marijuana use. Applicant stated: \n \n[I]n June 2001 [] he had a revelation that alcohol use and drug use were \nhurting him more than helping him. He did not have a supply of marijuana \navailable anymore, and it was while he was on the phone to a nurse trying \nto get a refill on Oxycontin that he realized he needed to stop all drug \n[abuse] and stop all drinking if he was going to live. He terminated the call \nto the nurse and has not used marijuana since June 2001 .  .  .  . When he \nwas at his parent\u2019s home in June 2001, he realized that things needed to \nchange if he was going to survive and if he was going to accomplish \nanything in his life.  .  .  .  He could not support himself holding menial \njobs. He decided at that moment to stop smoking marijuana and stop \ndrinking. He only recently began consuming a few beers on rare social \noccasions; he never resumed smoking marijuana.  \n \nId. at 1-2. He explained that his medical records from the alcohol-therapy sessions \nshould reflect that he was not currently using marijuana because \u201che had discontinued \nmarijuana use in June 2001 and never resumed it.\u201d Id. at 2.     \n \nThe OPM investigator asked Applicant about the medical evidence concerning \nhis more recent marijuana use and he still denied it (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 6). According to the \nOPM Report of Investigation (ROI), Applicant called the OPM investigator on June 10, \n2008, and left the OPM investigator a message, offering to \u201ccome clean\u201d about his \nmarijuana use (Tr. 30; GE 2 at 7). He realized that the OPM investigator had his \nadmissions in therapy about drug use that Applicant had written down (Tr. 31). He knew \nit was hopeless to continue to deny his more recent marijuana use (Tr. 31-32, 34). He \nwanted his security clearance decision to be made based on the true facts of his drug \nuse (Tr. 32). He felt guilty about lying and did not want the government to waste time \nand money investigating his drug use (Tr. 31-32, 34).  \n \nOn June 16, 2008, Applicant admitted his extensive marijuana use to the OPM \ninvestigator. He made consistent statements about his marijuana use continuing until \nJune 2007 in response to DOHA interrogatories on February 20, 2009, and April 3, \n2009, and at his hearing (Tr. 22-27).  \n \n \n3Applicant\u2019s June 9, 2008, and June 16, 2008, OPM interviews are the source for all the facts in \nthis paragraph and the next two paragraphs, unless another citation is provided (GE 3 at 5-10).  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nIn sum, Applicant admitted that he failed to disclose his 1999 arrest for DUI (Tr. \n23; SOR \u00b6 2.a) and his extensive marijuana use from 2002 until June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \nHe also admitted that he provided false information in his OPM interview on June 9, \n2008, about his marijuana use from 2002 to June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). At his hearing, he \nadmitted that his statements to the OPM investigator about ending his marijuana use in \nJune 2001 were intentionally false, and noted he used marijuana on numerous \noccasions after June 2001 (Tr. 26, 29). He expressed his remorse about making false \nstatements to the government (Tr. 35) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and E (personal conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the amended SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug4 involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying \n \n4AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Sch. I(c)(9). See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 \nU.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular \ncase: AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d5 and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession.\u201d   \n \nApplicant admitted frequent marijuana use, essentially on a daily basis, from \napproximately 1995 until June 2007. He possessed marijuana before he used it. He \nalso admitted using a larger quantity of Oxycontin, a prescription drug, than authorized \nby his prescription. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. The other disqualifying conditions \nlisted in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.   \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that the drug offenses are unlikely to recur or do not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright \nline\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \n\u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the \ndirective.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the \nAppeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an \n \n5AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \napplicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing \nwas not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without \nany evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent drug use was in June 2007, about 30 months ago. AG \u00b6 \n26(a) fully applies. His overall illegal drug use lasted approximately 12 years (1995 to \n2007), and involved numerous uses of marijuana. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies because his past \ndrug use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.7 Because of his abstention from drug use for about 30 months, and his \nrecognition of the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse, there is reasonable certitude \nthat he will continue to abstain from drug use. I am reasonably confident his illegal drug \npossession and use will not recur. Because he will not use illegal drugs in the future, \nconfidence in his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to \ndrug use is restored.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has disassociated himself from most of his drug-using \nassociates and contacts. After breaking his patterns of drug abuse, he has changed his \nlife with respect to drug use. He has abstained from drug abuse for about 30 months. \nHowever, he continues to associate with his brother and possibly some other marijuana \n                                            \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n7In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse.  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nusers. He did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(c) apply to his abuse of Oxycontin. He received Oxycontin to \ntreat his knee injury, and consumed more Oxycontin than he was supposed to from \nabout March 2001 to July 2001. He has not used Oxycontin since July 2001.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is not applicable because Applicant did not provide evidence of \nattendance at any drug treatment program. He has not provided any prognosis focusing \non his drug abuse by a duly qualified medical professional.   \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in June 2007, about 30 months \nago. The motivations to stop using drugs are evident.8 He understands the adverse \nresults from drug abuse. He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no \ndrug abuse to eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that on November 12, 2007, Applicant falsely denied that he \nhad ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. \nApplicant disclosed his December 2000 driving under influence of alcohol (DUI) arrest \nand his April 2001 arrest for driving with a suspended license. He explained that he did \n \n8Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nnot disclose his March 1999 DUI arrest because he thought he only had to disclose \ninformation about criminal offenses occurring in the last seven years. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that on November 12, 2007, Applicant falsely denied that he \nused illegal drugs in the last seven years. SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that on June 9, 2008, \nApplicant falsely denied to an OPM investigator that he used marijuana in the last seven \nyears. On June 16, 2008, he admitted to an OPM investigator that he knowingly and \nintentionally provided false information on June 9, 2008, in his previous OPM interview \nabout his marijuana abuse. In his amended SOR response and at his hearing he \nadmitted he intentionally falsified his November 12, 2007, security clearance application \nwith respect to the recency of his marijuana use. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant\u2019s false statement to the OPM \ninvestigator on June 8, 2009, because he made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts. On June 8, 2008, Applicant falsely \ndenied to an OPM investigator that he had used marijuana in the last seven years. He \nprovided a fairly elaborate description to the OPM investigator about why he ended his \nmarijuana use in 2001. After the interview, Applicant realized his lie about the recency \nof his marijuana use was not credible because medical records that the OPM \ninvestigator would review included information about his extensive, more recent \nmarijuana use. According to the OPM ROI, Applicant called the OPM investigator on \nJune 10, 2008, and left the OPM investigator a message, offering to \u201ccome clean\u201d about \nhis marijuana use. On June 16, 2008, he admitted to the OPM investigator that \nextensively used marijuana until June 2007, and that he falsified his June 9, 2008, OPM \ninterview about his marijuana abuse. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) mitigates the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Although Applicant admitted \nthat on November 12, 2007, he failed to disclose his March 1999 DUI arrest, he \nexplained that he mistakenly thought he only had to disclose information about criminal \noffenses occurring in the last seven years. This failure to disclose his March 1999 DUI \nwas not deliberate, and this allegation of falsification is unsubstantiated.9   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), 17(e) and 17(g) all apply in part to SOR \u00b6 2.b. His false \nstatement in connection with his 2007 security clearance application cannot be fully \nmitigated because it is too recent and serious. However, there are some positive signs \nof rehabilitation. He admitted his misconduct. No allegations of problems at his \nemployment have surfaced. He has changed the environment where most of his \nmarijuana use occurred. See AG \u00b6 17(g). He paid his fines and court costs in resulting \nfrom his DUI conviction. He has demonstrated remorse, an important step toward his \nrehabilitation. He received job training and has a good employment record. His security \nmanager is well aware of his alcohol-related and drug-abuse problems. Disclosure has \neliminated his \u201cvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d \n \nIn sum, Applicant intentionally lied on his 2007 security clearance application, \nand on June 9, 2008, to an OPM investigator. His false statement to the OPM \ninvestigator was elaborate and detailed, as he described changes in his life in 2001 that \ncaused him to end his marijuana use in June 2001. However, he corrected the \ninformation to the OPM investigator two days later before being confronted with the \n \n9The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nmedical records showing his extensive marijuana use. However, his deliberately false \nofficial statement in 2007 is too recent and serious to be mitigated.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n  \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. He has not committed any offenses since he provided false information to \nan OPM investigator on June 8, 2008. He took full responsibility for his marijuana use \non June 16, 2008, and at his hearing, for lying, and for his more recent and extensive \nmarijuana use. Applicant contributed to the national defense through his work for a \ngovernment contractor. There is no evidence of any disciplinary problems at work. \nThere is no evidence of drug abuse after June 2007. There is no evidence that he has \nfailed to safeguard sensitive or classified information. His character and good work \nperformance show substantial responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nBecause of his age and maturity, Applicant was well aware of the importance of \nproviding accurate information in the context of evaluating and retaining a security \nclearance. In November 2007, and on June 8, 2008, he intentionally provided false \ninformation about his marijuana use on his security clearance application and to an \nOPM investigator.10 His two false statements were knowledgeable, voluntary, and \n \n10Although Appellant was not charged with any offense because of his incorrect statements about \nhis marijuana use, Congress has manifested the importance of providing accurate information in matters \nsuch as security clearance applications by enacting a statute punishing materially false statements as \nfelony under Title 18 United States Code (U.S.C.) \u00a7 1001. \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nintentional.11 His providing of false information about his drug use on his 2007 security \nclearance application cannot be mitigated at this time. This misconduct shows lack of \njudgment and a lack of trustworthiness. Such conduct establishes a serious security \nconcern, and access to classified information is not warranted at this time.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not fully \nmitigated all security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors,\u201d12 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent \nfactors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. I conclude he has shown sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation \nto mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. However, personal conduct security \nconcerns cannot be mitigated at this time. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not \neligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE H:   \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n For Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n \n11 A prompt correction of the falsification is not a legal defense to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001; \nhowever, it is sufficient to mitigate security concerns about this false statement under AG \u00b6 17(a). \n \n12See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Her marijuana usage until \nFebruary 2008 is too recent to be mitigated at this time. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 2, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On March 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJune 30, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) (GE \n8). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 16, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (GE 9). \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on May 14, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me of May 15, 2009. At the hearing held on June 9, 2009, Department \nCounsel offered six exhibits (GE 1-6) (Transcripts (Tr.) 19). There were no objections, \nand I admitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 19). Applicant provided six exhibits (Tr. 44-45; AE A-F). \nDepartment Counsel did not object, and I admitted AE A-F (Tr. 45). I also admitted the \nhearing notice (GE 7), the SOR (GE 8), and Applicant\u2019s SOR response (GE 9). I held \nthe record open until June 9, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence. I \nreceived the transcript on June 17, 2009.

She \ndoes not have a police record (GE 1). \n \nDrug involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c)  \n \nApplicant used marijuana 10-15 times between 1999 and February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a; Tr. 49-59; GE 1, GE 9). She used cocaine three to five times between March 2006 \nand May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 60, 64; GE 1, GE 9). She used ecstasy twice in October \n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 61-63; GE 1, GE 9). She admitted her drug use on her May 2, \n2008, security clearance application (GE 1).  \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n\n \n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant first used marijuana in college (Tr. 49). Her use of illegal drugs was \nsporadic (Tr. 54). A year might pass between her uses of illegal drugs (Tr. 54). Her \nformer husband introduced her to illegal drugs (Tr. 49-50). She also used illegal drugs \nwith her roommate (Tr. 49-50). After five years of marriage, she told her husband that \nthey needed to get illegal drugs out of their lives (Tr. 51). He told her he quit, and then \nlater she found out he still used illegal drugs (Tr. 51). She finally divorced him because \nof his drug abuse (Tr. 52). She was separated from her husband in 2005, and the \ndivorce was final in August 2006 (Tr. 52). Her drug use was at social functions and was \nnever around her children (Tr. 52-53). Her ex-boyfriend was also a marijuana user (Tr. \n57). She had a daughter from her relationship with her ex-boyfriend (Tr. 58). Her \nrelationship with her ex-boyfriend ended because he consumed too much alcohol (Tr. \n58). The last time she used marijuana was at a Super Bowl party in February 2008 (Tr. \n53). She inhaled some marijuana smoke from a pipe being passed around the room (Tr. \n57). She immediately regretted using the marijuana and did not use more marijuana \nfrom the pipe the next time it was passed to her (Tr. 57).  \n \nApplicant has dissociated herself from known drug users (Tr. 54, 66-67). She \nprimarily associates on a social basis with co-workers at her government contractor \nemployment (Tr. 59). She still associates with her ex-boyfriend when he visits their \ndaughter, which is every other weekend (Tr. 59). She emphasized that she wanted to \nprotect her children and using drugs placed them at risk (Tr. 55, 67). She is the sole \nsupport for her three children, and their welfare was very important to her (Tr. 56). Her \ncurrent employment is the best employment she has had (Tr. 55-56). She and her \nchildren will have a better future if she can retain her current employment (Tr. 56). \n \nThe contractor informed Applicant that using illegal drugs while working for the \ncontractor was not permitted (Tr. 41). Before she began her employment with the \ncontractor, she received a urinalysis test, which was negative for the presence of illegal-\ndrug-related metabolites (Tr. 42).  \n \nApplicant has never received any drug therapy or treatment (Tr. 65). She \npromised not to use illegal drugs in the future (Tr. 65-67). On July 2, 2008, an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant about her drug use \n(GE 2). Her description of her drug involvement was consistent with her statement at \nher hearing (GE 2). \n \nOn June 9, 2009, Applicant provided a statement in accordance with AG \u00b6 26(b) \nto demonstrate her intent not to abuse illegal drugs in the future (AE G). She provided \n\u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of [her] clearance for any \nviolation\u201d (AE G). \n \nCharacter evidence \n \nA retired U.S. Marine Corps field grade officer (S), who has been an intelligence \nofficer for 17 years of his military service, is currently Applicant\u2019s supervisor (Tr. 25). S \nhas supervised her for about seven months (Tr. 31). S is a program manager for her \n\n \n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nemployer (Tr. 27). S described her as a diligent, responsible and trustworthy employee \n(Tr. 25, 34, 37). S was unsure about whether the contractor had an active urinalysis \ntesting program to detect illegal drug use (Tr. 28, 33). If S\u2019s employer has a urinalysis-\ndrug testing program, testing is infrequent (Tr. 28). For example, S had only been tested \nonce in the last 18 months, and that was shortly before starting his employment with the \ncontractor (Tr. 28, 32-33). Applicant\u2019s current responsibility is in administration and as \nan assistance operations coordinator (Tr. 30). She is also a deputy deployment \ncoordinator, which entails processing personnel to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq (Tr. \n35). She also assists with resolving the needs of deployed individuals once they are \ndeployed (Tr. 35-36). A clearance makes her job easier because it enables her to enter \nrestricted areas at various locations with less escort/in-processing issues (Tr. 30). \nHowever, if her clearance is denied, she will not be fired (Tr. 31). S did not know the \nbasis for the government\u2019s security concern (Tr. 32). \n      \nApplicant disclosed her drug abuse in general terms to the authors of three \nletters of recommendation/character references (Tr. 46; AE A-B, F). The authors of two \nletters are supervisors employed by the contractor that employs Applicant (AE A-B). \nThese three letters describe her as honest, reliable, and competent. She has excellent \nattention to detail, strong integrity and is very dependable. She is trustworthy and \nperforms beyond expectations. She would regard her responsibilities as a security \nclearance holder very seriously and conscientiously.  \n \nThe author of one letter is a former counterintelligence agent (C) (AE B). Since \nJanuary 2008, C has known Applicant at work and socially. C describes her as a superb \nemployee, who is completely trustworthy (AE B). C recommends Applicant for a position \nof trust and responsibility (AE B). \n \nOther contractor employees laud her work ethic and professionalism (AE C). \nThey recommend Applicant for a security clearance (AE C). Some character witnesses \nhave known Applicant for up to 20 years and compliment her for her love of her family, \nstrong leadership, solid character, and superb dedication to work and family (AE D, E).  \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n\n \n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \n\n \n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nconcern is under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular \ncase. AG \u00b6 25(a), indicates, \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d2 and AG \u00b6 25(c) states, \u201cillegal drug \npossession,\u201d could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 \nare not applicable. These disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used and \npossessed marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy.3 She disclosed her drug abuse in her SF-\n86, her responses to DOHA interrogatories, her SOR response, and at her hearing. She \npossessed marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy before she used these substances.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n2AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n3AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule (Sch.) I controlled \nsubstances. See Sch. I(c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. \n2006) (ecstasy). Cocaine is a Sch. II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine). \n\n \n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or do not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows \u201ca significant \nperiod of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative \njudge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d4 \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. The Appeal Board addressed the recency \nof drug use, stating:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n\n \n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant used marijuana 10-15 times between 1999 and February 2008. She \nused cocaine three to five times between March 2006 and May 2006. She used ecstasy \ntwice in October 2005. Applicant\u2019s last marijuana use was recent because it was 17 \nmonths before her hearing. She recognizes the adverse impact on her life of drug \nabuse. These actions create some certitude that she will continue to abstain from drug \nuse. AG \u00b6 26(a) partially applies to her drug-related offenses.5    \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate her intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. She has disassociated from her drug-using associates and \ncontacts, except for her ex-boyfriend who visits their daughter every two weeks. She \nhas broken her patterns of drug abuse, and she has changed her life with respect to \nillegal drug use. She has abstained from drug abuse for almost 17 months. Applicant \nprovided \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) fully apples.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. Marijuana, \ncocaine and/or ecstasy were never prescribed for her. She did not satisfactorily \ncomplete a prescribed drug treatment program. Moreover, she cannot receive full credit \nbecause she did not provide \u201ca favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements.\u201d \n  \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended her drug abuse in February 2009, about 17 \nmonths ago. Aside from her marijuana use, all of her other illegal drug use ended in May \n2006 or earlier.6 The motivations to stop using illegal drugs are evident. She \n \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n5In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n6The Appeal Board has reversed decisions granting a clearance because the administrative judge \nconsidered individual acts of misconduct one-by-one and determined the isolated acts were mitigated. \nISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. \n17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006). Here, Applicant used marijuana 10-\n15 times and stopped using marijuana in February 2008. She used cocaine three to five times between \nMarch 2006 and May 2006. She used ecstasy twice in October 2005. Her repeated abuse of these \nparticular drugs is relevant in the whole person analysis, but individually, as listed in the SOR, the abuse \nof two of the three illegal drugs more than three years ago is insufficiently aggravating to cause denial of \nher clearance. In ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008), the Appeal Board explained it \nis the overall conduct that determines whether a clearance should be granted stating: \n \nThe Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category \n\n \n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nunderstands the adverse results from drug abuse.7 She has shown or demonstrated a \nsufficient track record of no drug abuse to partially, but not completely, mitigate drug \ninvolvement as a bar to her access to classified information.  If she continues to refrain \nfrom drug abuse and other misconduct for 12 additional months after the date of this \ndecision, she would have shown a sufficient period of rehabilitation to warrant approval \nof her security clearance.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nwas relatively young and immature when she began using illegal drugs. Applicant \nadmitted that she used illegal drugs on her SF-86. She continued to admit her drug use \n \nof incidents separately, the Judge failed to consider the significance of the \u201cevidence as a \nwhole\u201d and Applicant's pattern of conduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, \n866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). Under the whole person concept, a \nJudge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge\u2019s \npiecemeal analysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of \u00b6 \nE2.2 of the Directive. \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006), see Whole Person Concept at pages \n9-10, infra.  \n \n7Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nin her OPM interview, response to DOHA interrogatories, response to the SOR, and at \nher hearing. All of her statements were consistent. Her admissions of drug use are a \npositive sign that Applicant is taking responsibility for her drug use in the context of her \nsecurity clearance. There were no police records describing her drug involvement. She \nstopped using illegal drugs in February 2008. She knows the consequences of drug \nabuse. Applicant contributes to her company and the Department of Defense. There is \nno evidence of any disciplinary problems at work. For example, there is no evidence \nshe used illegal drugs at work. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that she would \nintentionally violate national security. Her good character and superb work performance \nare established by her character witness and the statements she provided. Her strong \nwork performance shows significant responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. Her \nsupervisors evidently support her or she would not have been able to retain her \nemployment after her security clearance was called into question. Even more \nimportantly, her employer intends to continue her employment even if her security \nclearance is not approved.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at this \ntime. Applicant used marijuana 10-15 times between 1999 and February 2008. She \nused cocaine three to five times between March 2006 and May 2006. She used ecstasy \ntwice in October 2005. She has not received drug counseling or treatment. Each time \nshe used illegal drugs, she possessed the illegal drugs before she used them. Each \ntime she possessed illegal drugs, she committed a state and federal crime. Most of her \ndrug use involved use in a social setting with drug-using friends. Essentially she gave in \nto peer pressure and accepted and used drugs she received from other drug users. She \nknew what she was doing was wrong, and did it anyway.  Her poor judgment placed her \nfamily at risk and she was exposed to possible civil sanctions.   \n \nIn conclusion, I am impressed with Applicant\u2019s sincerity and commitment to \nrefrain from using illegal drugs. She has not used illegal drugs for 17 months. If she can \ncontinue to abstain from illegal drug use for a year after the date of this decision, and \navoids any other conduct that raises a security concern, a security clearance should be \napproved for her. I conclude that if these conditions are met, by July 1, 2010, her drug \ninvolvement will be fully mitigated by the passage of time.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug involvement at this time.     \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information at this time. \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance at this time.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Position (SF 86) for \nemployment with a defense contractor on April 4, 2008. On May 12, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns for criminal conduct, alcohol consumption, \nfinancial considerations, and personal conduct under Guidelines J, G, F, and E, \nrespectively. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 26, 2009. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response received at \nDOHA on June 10. 2009. Applicant admitted 18 of the 20 allegations of criminal conduct \nunder Guideline J, admitted the four allegations of alcohol consumption under Guideline \nG with explanation, admitted the five allegations of financial considerations under \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 20, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGuideline F with explanation, and denied the one allegation of personal conduct under \nGuideline E. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.   \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 22, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on September 4, 2009. Applicant was not immediately available for \na hearing since he was serving overseas for his employer. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on November 23, 2009, for a hearing on December 10, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The government offered six exhibits, marked government \nexhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his behalf and offered two exhibits admitted without objection as (App. Ex.) \nA and B. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 23, 2009. \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received the Notice of Hearing on November 30, 2009, 11 days before \nthe hearing. Applicant is entitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive \nE3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of December \n10, 2009, before the Notice of Hearing was mailed so actual notice was given more than \n15 days prior to the hearing. However, At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days \nnotice requirement (Tr. 6-7). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all but two of the 20 allegations \nunder criminal conduct, all of the allegations under alcohol consumption and financial \nconsiderations, and denied the one allegation under personal conduct. \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and has worked for his defense contractor employer for \nmore than two years as an electronics technician and equipment repairman. He was \ndeployed twice by his employer to Afghanistan for months at a time. His total time \ndeployed to this war area was about a year. He received a certificate of achievement \nfrom the command in Afghanistan (App. Ex. A, Certificate, dated August 22, 2008). He \nalso received a letter of commendation from his supervisor in Afghanistan (App. Ex. B, \nLetter, undated). He is divorced but has two adult children from a prior marriage (Tr. 17-\n18; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated April 4, 2008).  \n \nThe criminal charges against Applicant date from 1976, and mainly consist of \ndriving offenses, domestic assaults, drug possession, or disorderly conduct. Applicant \nadmitted all the criminal conduct allegations except two. One he did not remember, and \nthe other he believed was a duplicate of another offense he admitted. Applicant \nadmitted he was arrested for and found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in \n2002 (SOR 1.b), 1995 (SOR 1.d), 1992 (SOR 1.i), and 1980 (SOR 1.s). He did not \nremember an arrest and conviction for driving under the influence in 1991 (SOR 1.k). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHowever, the Government presented sufficient information from criminal justice reports \nto establish the offense (Gov. Ex. 2). He admits to an arrest and conviction for open \ncontainer in 2006 (SOR 1.a), and 1992 (SOR 1.j). For the 2006 offense, Applicant drove \nhis truck to fish with some friends. They were drinking beer and using a cooler in his \ntruck. After fishing, he was stopped by police at a random traffic stop and an open \ncontainer of beer was found in the cooler in his truck. He did not know the open \ncontainer was in his truck. Applicant admits to being arrested and convicted for public \nintoxication in 1994 (SOR 1.g).  \n \nApplicant admits he was arrested for and convicted of driving on a suspended \nlicense in 1998 (SOR 1.c), 1994 (SOR 1.f), 1987 (SOR 1.l), 1986 (SOR 1.m), and 1982 \n(SOR 1.r). He admits he was arrested for and convicted of disorderly conduct in 1985 \n(SOR 1.p), 1983 (SOR 1.q), and 1976 (SOR 1.t).  \n \nApplicant admits he was arrested for and found guilty of assault and trespass in \n1995 (SOR 1.e). Applicant's mother told him that his stepbrother had taken some of her \njewelry. He called his stepbrother and told him he was coming to his home to retrieve \nthe jewelry. His stepbrother called the police and when he arrived at the house, he was \narrested for trespass and assault. He was convicted and fined (Tr. 27-28).  \n \nA charge of criminal domestic violence was dismissed (SOR 1.h). Applicant \nbelieved this was a charge related to the attempt to retrieve his mother's jewelry. \nHowever, this offense happened over a year before the offense relating to his mother's \njewelry listed above. The dismissed criminal domestic violence charge is a separate \noffense. Applicant admits he was arrested and charged with petty larceny in 1985 \n(SOR. 1.o; Tr. 28). \n \nApplicant admits he was arrested in 1986, and charged with possession of \ncocaine with the intent to distribute, and conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine \n(SOR 1.n). He was sentenced to three years confinement, and served two years in a \nfederal penitentiary. Applicant injured his leg and it was in a cast for a period of time, \nand he could not work. He agreed with a co-conspirator to receive a fee for driving to a \ncity, picking up the cocaine, and bringing it back to the co-conspirator. He agreed to the \ndeal since he needed money. He was arrested after picking up the cocaine (Tr. 31-33; \nGov. Ex. 2, Criminal justice report, undated).  \n \nThe eight alcohol-related offenses were also cross-alleged as security concerns \nunder Guideline G (SOR 2.a). Applicant also admits he still consumes alcohol (SOR \n2.b). He was in Afghanistan for a number of months in early 2009, where he was unable \nto drink alcohol. As soon as he returned to the United States, he started drinking \nalcohol. He admitted to drinking about five or six beers the weekend before the hearing \nwhen he was watching football on television with his friends. Applicant never was \nordered to seek treatment for alcohol abuse, but was required to attend driving and \ndrinking awareness courses (Tr. 21-38, 47-50; Gov. Ex. 2, Criminal justice report, \nundated). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated December 4, 2009; Gov. Ex. 5, \nCredit report, dated April 18, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 6, Credit report dated March 3, 2009) \nlist the following delinquent debts for Applicant: a collection account for $1,126 on a \ncredit card (SOR. 3.a); an online shopping account charged-off for $260 (SOR 3.b, also \nlisted at SOR 3.e); another credit card account in collection for $8,243 (SOR 3.c); and \nanother credit card account in collection to the same creditor for $260 (SOR d). These \ndebts were incurred by his former wife from whom he is now divorced. Since the items \nwere purchased for her, she agreed to pay for them. However, she declared bankruptcy \nso the creditors are now seeking payment from him. He has talked to some of the \ncreditors and said he would pay half of the debt amount. That offer was rejected. He \nhas not made any payments on the debts. When he was last in Afghanistan, he saved \nmoney, but had to use it to live while he was not working from July to November 2009. \nHis present monthly salary is $2,700 with his expenses about the same. He is current \nwith his present bills, but unable to pay these past due debts (Tr. 38-44, 50-53). \n \nApplicant denied falsifying his security clearance application by failing to disclose \nall driving while intoxicated and traffic offenses in response to a question concerning his \npolice record. Applicant answered \"YES\" to the question whether he ever had been \ncharged with or convicted of an offense involving alcohol or drugs. He listed a driving \nwhile intoxicated offense in 2001, and the possession and distributing cocaine offense \nin 1984. He did not list any other offenses. Applicant did not remember the dates, facts, \nand circumstances of all of his arrests and convictions involving drugs or alcohol. He \nknew of the cocaine offense since he was in a federal penitentiary for the offense. He \nnoted a driving while intoxicated offense for 2001, when it was actually 1998. He did not \nlist any other offenses because he was unsure of the dates and circumstances. He \nknew that his criminal record would be examined and considered (Tr. 44-47).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Applicant's multiple arrests and \nconvictions for driving while intoxicated, driving on a suspended/revoked driver's \nlicense, assault, trespassing, domestic violence, and possession of cocaine with intent \nto distribute raise Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a \nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CD DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted). \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under criminal conduct. \nApplicant raised by his testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) AG \u00b6 \n32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) \n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement). There \nwas a pattern of criminal conduct from as early as 1986. In some years, there is more \nthan one offense. While most of the offenses are driving or alcohol-related, he did have \na serious felony offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute for which he \n\n \n6 \n \n \nserved two years in a federal penitentiary. The last offense was an open container \noffense in 2006, which was dismissed. All of the offenses happened because Applicant \nmade a conscious decision to drive after drinking alcohol, drive knowing that his license \nwas revoked or suspended, have alcohol in his possession, and possess cocaine in \norder to drive the substance to another location. The offenses did not happen under \nunusual or unique circumstances. Similar criminal incidents are likely to recur because \nApplicant still drinks alcohol and he could easily decide to drink and drive. Applicant \nstated he has matured and drinks only at home and does not drive after drinking. \nHowever, he is not involved in any counseling or alcohol prevention program to assist \nhim in not drinking and driving. Applicant has not presented sufficient information to \nmitigate security concerns for criminal conduct.  \n  \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption is a security concern because it often leads to \nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness (AG \u00b6 21). Applicant's \narrests for driving under the influence of alcohol and possession of alcohol in an open \ncontainer raise Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22(a) \n(alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent).   \n \n \nI considered Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) AG \u00b6 23(a) (so \nmuch time has passed or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and determine that it \ndoes not apply. There were eight arrests for alcohol-related incidents from 1980 until \n2006. During two of those years, he was in prison. In the last two years, he spent time in \nAfghanistan where he could not drink alcohol. He drank as soon as he returned and still \ndrinks alcohol. Applicant willingly drank alcohol and his willingness to drink alcohol \ncould lead to more alcohol-related incidents.   \n \n \nI also considered AC MC AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her \nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome \nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser)), and determined that it does not apply. Applicant \ndoes not acknowledge that alcohol is a problem for him. He continues to drink alcohol \non social occasions. He drank alcohol as soon as he returned from Afghanistan, and \nhas continues to consume alcohol mainly at home.  \n \n \nApplicant does not attend alcohol-related counseling, and he has not actively \nparticipated in counseling since completion of court order counseling after driving while \nintoxicated convictions. AC MC AG \u00b6 23(c) (the individual is a current employee who is \nparticipating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand relapse, and is making satisfactory progress); and AC MC AG \u00b6 23(d) (the \nindividual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation \nalong with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) \ndo not apply. Appellant has not presented information to meet his burden that his past \nalcohol use does not reflect now on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAppellant has not mitigated security concerns for alcohol consumption. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThere is a security concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts, as established by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nstatements and testimony, are a security concern raising Financial Consideration \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and \nFC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Applicant has \napproximately four delinquent debts from credit cards and home shopping totaling over \n$10,000. These debts indicate a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as \nan inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \n\n \n8 \n \n \nunder the circumstances). The debts were incurred during the marriage by his ex-wife in \nboth of their names. However, the purchases were for her. The debts became \ndelinquent when Applicant was divorced from his ex-wife. His ex-wife filed bankruptcy \nand the debts for her were discharged. The creditors are now seeking payment from \nhim. While he may be legally responsible for the debts since they were incurred under \nboth his ex-wife's and his name, the conditions causing the debts to be attributed to him \nare not within his control. His ex-wife was to assume the debts but they became solely \nhis debts when she received a discharge of debts by bankruptcy. The fact his ex-wife \nhad her debts discharged by bankruptcy was a condition beyond his control. The debts \ndo not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI have considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). This mitigating condition does not apply since there is no \ninformation concerning Applicant receiving financial counseling.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments. All that is \nrequired is that an applicant demonstrates that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and has taken significant actions to implement that plan. Applicant \ncontacted at least one of the creditors for one of the credit card debts. He was unable to \nmake payments on the debts since his salary permits him only to meet his current \nobligations. He is unable to pay these debts at this time and has no plan to pay them.  \n \nApplicant presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for \nfinancial considerations. He established that the reasons for his debts were beyond his \ncontrol since his ex-wife incurred the debts, and was to pay them, but the debts were \ndischarged for her in a bankruptcy action. Creditors are now seeking payment from him. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process (AG \u00b6 15). Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information. The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information. \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s incomplete answers to a question on his security clearance \napplication concerning his police record raises a potential security concern under \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, to \ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification. In response to questions on the security \nclearance application, Applicant listed one alcohol-related driving incident and a \npossession of cocaine with intent to sell conviction. He failed to list other alcohol-related \noffenses because he was unsure of the dates and circumstances of the events. A \nsecurity concern may arise for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material \nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a \nsecurity clearance. But every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully. Applicant was unsure of the facts, circumstances, and dates of \nall of his alcohol-related incidents. Since Applicant listed the one driving while \nintoxicated offense and his one drug offense, he put the government on notice that he \nhad alcohol and drug-related criminal conduct. The available information shows his \nfailure to list all of the offenses was not knowing and willful. Applicant established he did \nnot deliberately fail to provide full information on the security clearance application with \nintent to deceive. I find for Appellant as to Personal Conduct pertaining to falsification of \nthe security clearance application.   \n \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant is a good \nemployee commended by his supervisor and the military command. I considered that he \ndeployed to Afghanistan twice to assist the military with maintenance of vehicles. I \nconsidered that he did not deliberately provide incomplete information on his security \nclearance application, and that his financial issues were caused by conditions beyond \nhis control. Applicant has a 30-year history of criminal conduct from 1976 until 2006. He \nhas a series of alcohol-related incidents starting in 1980. His last alcohol-related \nincident was in 2006. Sufficient time without alcohol-related incidents has not passed to \nmitigate alcohol consumption issues given that Applicant has at least one alcohol-\nrelated conduct a year from 2000 to 2006. His actions indicate poor self control, lack of \njudgment, and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Overall, on balance the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and alcohol \nconsumption. He mitigated security concerns for financial considerations and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i - 1.t: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old (Tr. 6, 28).2 He received his high school diploma in 1998 (Tr. 22). He earned a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in biology in December 2002 (Tr. 6, 22). He has never served in the military (Tr. 6). He has never married. He has never held a security clearance (Tr. 6). He has never been charged with any felony, any firearms or explosives offense, or any offense related to alcohol or drugs. He has not been arrested or charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type offenses in the last seven years, except for a 2002 arrest for failure to leave (GE 2 at 5). Later the failure to leave charge was dismissed (GE 2 at 5). In the last seven years, he has not had any debts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy petitions, unpaid judgments, or unpaid liens. From 2000 to 2005, he had part-time employment at a university (Tr. 22-23). From 2005 to March 2006, he worked for a corporation as an environmental engineer (Tr. 23). He was unemployed from March to October 2006 (Tr. 24). From October 2006 to March 2007, he worked as an environmental consultant for another firm (Tr. 24-25). 1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

He failed to mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 8, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (2008 SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApril 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) (GE \n11). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing (GE 12). Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 16, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me that same day. At the hearing held on April 17, \n2009, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits (GEs 1-8) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19). \nThere were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-8 (Tr. 19). I held the record open until \nApril 24, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit documentary evidence (Tr. 14). After the \nhearing, Applicant provided six more exhibits, which were admitted without objection \n(AEs A-F). I also admitted the hearing notice and amended notice (GEs 9-10), the SOR \n(GE 11), and Applicant\u2019s SOR response (GE 12). I received the transcript on April 24, \n2009.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (GE \n12). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 28 years old (Tr. 6, 28).2 He received his high school diploma in \n1998 (Tr. 22). He earned a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in biology in December 2002 \n(Tr. 6, 22). He has never served in the military (Tr. 6). He has never married. He has \nnever held a security clearance (Tr. 6). He has never been charged with any felony, any \nfirearms or explosives offense, or any offense related to alcohol or drugs. He has not \nbeen arrested or charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type offenses in the last \nseven years, except for a 2002 arrest for failure to leave (GE 2 at 5). Later the failure to \nleave charge was dismissed (GE 2 at 5). In the last seven years, he has not had any \ndebts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy petitions, unpaid judgments, or unpaid \nliens. \n \nFrom 2000 to 2005, he had part-time employment at a university (Tr. 22-23). \nFrom 2005 to March 2006, he worked for a corporation as an environmental engineer \n(Tr. 23). He was unemployed from March to October 2006 (Tr. 24). From October 2006 \nto March 2007, he worked as an environmental consultant for another firm (Tr. 24-25).   \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n2Applicant\u2019s 2008 SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated \notherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIn March 2007, Applicant began working as an environmental scientist for his \ncurrent employer, a government contractor (Tr. 25). He performs environmental site \nassessments, and collects groundwater and soil samples for testing and classification \n(Tr. 26). He did not believe his continued employment with the contractor was \ncontingent on approval of his security clearance (Tr. 54-55). \n \nIllegal Drug Possession and Sale \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana approximately 65 times from about September 1998 to \nabout April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 26-28; GE 12), hallucinogenics (mushrooms) about \nfive times from about August 2001 to about February 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 31-33; GE 2 \nat 2; GE 3 at 3; GE 12),3 and cocaine about six times from about June 2001 to about \nNovember 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. 36-37; GE 12). He sold a small amount of marijuana for \nabout $5 on two occasions (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. 41; GE 3 at 3; GE 12). He used illegal drugs \nbecause of peer pressure and to experiment (Tr. 54).  \n \nApplicant used marijuana approximately once a week, and sometimes every \nother week throughout his years of college attendance (Tr. 27). After he graduated from \ncollege in 2002, he continued to use marijuana with less frequency, perhaps once a \nmonth or even less frequently (Tr. 27-28). He ended his marijuana use in April 2008 (Tr. \n26). \n \nApplicant used steroids every other day for four of five weeks, during two time \nperiods from about October 2005 to about May 2006, while he was playing semi-\nprofessional football (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 31-33, 41; GE 3 at 3-4). He did not have a \nprescription authorizing steroid use (Tr. 42). He did not use steroids after May 2006 (Tr. \n33).  \n \nApplicant was offered cocaine as recently as the fall of 2008 from a friend he has \nknown since high school (Tr. 38). He refused the offer of cocaine (Tr. 38). He continues \nto have occasional contact with the friend (Tr. 39).  \n \nApplicant did not have any problems at work because of his illegal drug use (Tr. \n43). He did use illegal drugs at work or during lunch breaks (Tr. 44). He passed every \ndrug test at his employment and the tests did not detect any traces of illegal substances \nin his system (Tr. 44-46).4 He provided negative drug-test results for urinalysis tests on \nSeptember 21, 2007 (AE D), March 19, 2008 (AE E), and November 20, 2008 (GE F). \nApplicant disclosed his illegal drug use on his security clearance application and to an \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator (GE 1, section 24; GE 3 at 3). He \ncontinues to associate with friends or associates, who he knows are or were illegal drug \nusers (Tr. 48). Generally, his friends and associates rarely use illegal drugs in his \n \n3He was unsure about the drug in the mushrooms, or \u201cshrooms\u201d, but conceded it was a \nhallucinogenic substance that he took to feel a drug-like effect (Tr. 33-34; GE 12). \n \n4One employer-administered drug test was positive for the presence of a prescription-authorized \ndrug (Tr. 47-48, 58). Because he was authorized use of the prescription drug by his dentist, this test result \nraises no adverse security concerns.  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npresence; however, the most recent illegal drug usage by others in his presence \noccurred in a friend\u2019s apartment on a balcony about four months before his hearing (Tr. \n49-53).   \n \nApplicant has never received counseling for drug abuse (Tr. 53; GE 3 at 4). He \nemphasized that his drug use was part of the process of growing up and \nexperimentation (Tr. 62). He was not dependent on illegal drugs (Tr. 62). He is tested at \nwork for drugs (Tr. 63). He does not intend to ever use illegal drugs again (Tr. 54, 63; \nGE 2 at 2).    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions related to drug involvement that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: \u201cany \ndrug abuse,\u201d5 and \u201cillegal drug possession or sale or distribution.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply because Applicant used marijuana, cocaine, \nmushrooms (psilocybin), or steroids (without a prescription) from September 1998 to \n \n5AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApril 2008.6 The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. He \ndisclosed his illegal drug use on his security clearance application, to an OPM \ninvestigator, and at his hearing. He used illegal drugs primarily because he was curious \nabout the effects of the drugs and his peers and friends were using illegal drugs. He \npossessed these illegal drugs before he used them. He sold marijuana on two \noccasions. \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n6AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substance. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. \nRaish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). Mushrooms are the street \nname for psilocybin or psilocin, which is a Sch. I Controlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, \n351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Sch. I(c)(15) and I(c)(16) \ncontrolled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). Cocaine is a Sch. II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) \n(cocaine). The adverse medical consequences of use of these illegal drugs are described in detail in GEs \n4-8). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was on April 2008, about 12 months prior to his \nhearing. AG \u00b6 26(a) partially applies. His overall illegal drug use lasted approximately \nten years (1998 to 2008), and involved numerous uses of marijuana, cocaine, \nmushrooms, and steroids. AG \u00b6 26(a) cannot be fully applied because his past drug use \nwas so extensive and is too recent. There remains some doubt about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.8 He has abstained from drug use for about \n12 months, and he recognizes the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse. These \nactions create some certitude that he will continue to abstain from drug use. However, \nmore time is needed to increase confidence that his illegal drug possession and use will \nnot recur and to fully establish his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment \nwith respect to abstaining from illegal drug use.   \n \n7 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n8In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has somewhat disassociated from his drug-using \nassociates and contacts. He has refused offers to possess and use illegal drugs.  He \ncontinues to associate with some current or former drug users. He has broken or \nreduced the prevalence of his patterns of drug abuse, and he has changed his own life \nwith respect to illegal drug use. He has abstained from drug abuse for about 12 months. \nHowever, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.\u201d9 AG \u00b6 26(b) does not fully apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. The \nmarijuana, cocaine, mushrooms, and steroids were never prescribed for him. He did not \nsatisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment program, including rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements. \n  \nIn sum, Applicant ended his marijuana abuse in April 2008, about 12 months ago. \nAside from his marijuana use, all of his other illegal drug use ended in May 2006 or \nearlier.10 His non-marijuana use is not recent. The motivations to stop using illegal drugs \nare evident. He understands the adverse results from drug abuse.11 He has, however, \n \n9Even if he had provided such a statement, insufficient time has elapsed since his most recent \nillegal drug use to warrant full application of this mitigating condition.  \n \n10The Appeal Board has reversed decisions granting a clearance because the administrative \njudge considered individual acts of misconduct one-by-one and determined the isolated acts were \nmitigated. ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006). Here, Applicant used \nhallucinogenics until February 2002, cocaine until November 2001, steroids until May 2006, and \nmarijuana until April 2008. His repeated abuse of these particular drugs is relevant in the whole person \nanalysis, but individually, as listed in the SOR, the abuse of three of the four illegal drugs more than three \nyears ago is insufficiently aggravating to cause denial of his clearance. In ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 \n(App. Bd. June 27, 2008), the Appeal Board explained it is the overall conduct that determines whether a \nclearance should be granted stating: \n \nThe Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category \nof incidents separately, the Judge failed to consider the significance of the \u201cevidence as a \nwhole\u201d and Applicant's pattern of conduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, \n866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). Under the whole person concept, a \nJudge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge\u2019s \npiecemeal analysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of \u00b6 \nE2.2 of the Directive. \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006), see Whole Person Concept \nat pages 9-10, infra.  \n \n11Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nnot shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of marijuana abstinence to eliminate \ndrug involvement as a bar to his access to classified information.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nwas relatively young and immature when he began using illegal drugs. He stopped \nusing illegal drugs in April 2008. In 2008, he frankly and candidly admitted his extensive \nhistory of drug use on his 2008 security clearance application. He subsequently \nadmitted his drug use to an OPM investigator, in his response to DOHA interrogatories, \non his SOR response, and at his hearing. He knows the consequences of drug abuse. \nApplicant contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no \nevidence at work of any other disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty \nor that he would intentionally violate national security. His character and good work \nperformance show some responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His supervisors \nevidently support him or he would not have been able to retain his employment after his \nsecurity clearance was called into question. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain \nfrom drug use, and avoids future offenses he will have future potential for access to \nclassified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a problem with drug abuse from 1998 to 2008. Applicant used \nhallucinogenics until February 2002, cocaine until November 2001, steroids until May \n2006, and marijuana until April 2008. He used illegal drugs on numerous occasions. He \nhas not received drug counseling or treatment. He continues to associate with some \nfriends or associates that used and may currently be using illegal drugs. He was offered \ncocaine by a friend in the last 12 months. His abstinence from drug abuse for 12 months \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nis an insufficient period of time to mitigate drug involvement security concerns. His \nnumerous decisions to possess and use illegal drugs over a ten-year period were \nknowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. These offenses show a serious lack of judgment and a \nfailure to abide by the law. Such judgment lapses are relevant in the context of security \nrequirements. His misconduct raises a serious security concern, and a security \nclearance is not warranted at this time. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug involvement primarily because his marijuana use is \nstill too recent.  See n. 10, supra (explaining why all misconduct must be considered as \npart of whole person concept).    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMARK W. HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n \n12See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old administrative assistant (secretary) employed by a defense contractor. She is single and has no children. She received her high school diploma in June 1987. Applicant\u2019s work history is summarized as follows: she has been consistently employed since June 1990 to the present, except during three periods of unemployment. She was unemployed from December 2003 to February 2004 (three months); April 2006 to October 2006 (seven months); and April 2007 to December 2007 (nine months). Applicant testified she has had access to classified information at the top secret level since 1998 (Tr. 9).

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 8, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 29, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nAugust 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn March 30, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 22, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 1, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on May 19, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4. I left the record open to allow \nApplicant time to submit additional documentary information. She timely submitted AE \n5. All Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on May 28, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR with explanations, \nexcept for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.o, which she denied. Her admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old administrative assistant (secretary) employed by a \ndefense contractor. She is single and has no children. She received her high school \ndiploma in June 1987. Applicant\u2019s work history is summarized as follows: she has been \nconsistently employed since June 1990 to the present, except during three periods of \nunemployment. She was unemployed from December 2003 to February 2004 (three \nmonths); April 2006 to October 2006 (seven months); and April 2007 to December 2007 \n(nine months).  \n \nApplicant testified she has had access to classified information at the top secret \nlevel since 1998 (Tr. 9). There is no evidence that she has ever compromised or caused \nothers to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications in January 2006 and January \n2008. In her response to the financial delinquencies questions, Applicant admitted that \nshe was currently over 90 days delinquent in many of her debts, and that during the last \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other \ndeterminations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued \non or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nseven years she had been over 180 days delinquent on many of her debts. Her \nbackground investigation addressed Applicant\u2019s financial status and included the review \nof March 2008, November 2008, and April 2009 credit bureau reports (CBRs), and court \nrecords of judgments filed against her in 2006 and 2007.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $40,900, some of which have been delinquent for a number of years. In \nher response to the SOR, Applicant admitted these were her debts and that some are \noutstanding. The debts are also established by the admitted CBRs.  \n \nApplicant testified that her financial problems were caused by three \nunemployment periods between December 2003 and December 2008; the end of a \nrelationship which forced her to move out of her apartment prior to the expiration of her \nlease, and unforeseen vehicle repair expenses. Because of the limited income she \nreceived through her unemployment benefits, she could not afford to pay both her past \nfinancial obligations and her day-to-day living expenses. This resulted in her falling \nbehind on her financial obligations. Once she was employed again, Applicant started \nmaking payment arrangements with her creditors. Because of the number of creditors, \nApplicant could not afford to pay all the creditors at the same time. She has been paying \nher creditors one at a time. \n \nApplicant has been working diligently to resolve her financial problems. When \nunemployed, she sought additional employment. She contacted her creditors to let them \nknow she was unemployed and of her resulting financial problems. When she obtained \nemployment, she contacted her creditors, negotiated settlement agreements, and \nestablished payment plans to resolve any outstanding balances.  \n \nThe status of the alleged SOR debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($4,837) is a debt resulting from a lawsuit Applicant lost in October \n2006. In November 2006, Applicant established a payment plan with the creditor \nagreeing to pay $100 a month. She has been making regular payments thereafter, \nexcept during the period she was unemployed. After finding a new job, Applicant \ncontinued making the agreed payments (AE 3, Tr. 39). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($4,498) and SOR \u00b6 1.e ($4,498) alleged the same credit card debt \n(Tr. 89-90). Applicant fell behind on her payments and was paying other debts first. In \nJanuary 2007, the creditor obtained a judgment against her. Applicant has been paying \nthis debt through a garnishment of wages initiated in September 2008 (Tr. 38, 50-52, \nAE 1). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($3,105) is a debt resulting from a broken apartment lease. Applicant \nis waiting to pay other delinquent debts first and then promised to address this debt (Tr. \n52-53). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,026) is a credit card debt. Applicant is waiting to pay other \ndelinquent debts first and then has promised to address this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($578) and SOR \u00b6 1.p ($1,044) alleged the same debt. At the hearing, \nApplicant testified she had settled the debt for less than the total value. Documents \nsubmitted post-hearing confirm Applicant settled the debt in June 2009, and is making \npayments (AE 5, pp. 8-10, Tr. 56).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,041) and SOR \u00b6 1.q ($583) alleged the same retail credit card \ndebt. Applicant was in negotiations with the collection agency. She is waiting to pay \nother debts first and then promised to address this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($837) is disputed. She testified she talked to the creditor and was \ntold there was nothing in their file establishing this debt (Tr. 59). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,878) is her delinquent credit card debt. Applicant is waiting to pay \nother delinquent debts first and then will address this debt. This is the same debt that \nwas alleged under SOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,041). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($568). In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted this debt and \nindicated she was in communication with the creditor and was trying to settle the debt. \nAt her hearing, she testified she had settled the debt, but presented no documentary \nevidence to corroborate her testimony. Post-hearing Applicant submitted documents \ncorroborating she settled the debt, and that she made a $178 payment (AE 5, pp. 12-\n13). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($11,436). This delinquent debt pertains to Applicant\u2019s car. She \npurchased a used vehicle and stopped making payments when she lost her job. She \ntestified she informed the creditor she had lost her job and tried to return the vehicle. \nThe creditor elected not to repossess the vehicle, and she is still driving it. She does not \nknow who owns the delinquent account now. She promised to add this debt to her \nrepayment plans when she locates the creditor. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($2,051). This debt concerns a loan Applicant obtained. She stopped \nmaking payments when she lost her job. In July 2008, she started working again and \nresumed paying her loan through direct deposit (Tr. 64). After her hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted a letter from the creditor stating she paid off the debt (AE 5, at 3). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($155). Applicant paid this debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($387). Applicant admitted this debt. She is undergoing settlement \nnegotiations with the creditor.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o ($1,397). Applicant disputed this debt. This is her sister\u2019s account. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant also presented documents showing she entered into a payment \nagreement with the Internal Revenue Service to pay for past due taxes, and with her \nstate to repay an overpayment of social benefits she received.  \n \nApplicant sought financial assistance from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.l (a bank) \nwhen she lost her job and could not make the loan payments. The bank referred her to \na debt consolidation company. Applicant contacted the debt consolidation company; \nhowever, she was told they could not help her because she did not have enough debt \n(Tr. 74-77). In 2008, Applicant contracted with another company to assist her with \ndisputing some of her debts and with cleaning up her CBR (Tr. 71-72).  \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for her financial problems. She was candid \nand credible explaining the circumstances surrounding her financial problems. She \ncredibly testified she is paying as much as she can to resolve her delinquent debts. She \nis paying her delinquent debts one debt at a time, and her payments are within her \nfinancial means. Applicant has been honest and forthcoming in the security application \nprocess. She disclosed her financial problems on her security clearance applications \nand has been up-front with her security officers.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent and/or charged off debts (not counting duplicate \nallegations) some of which have been delinquent for a number of years. The debts are \nApplicant\u2019s debts as established by the evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions, except for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.o, which she disputed.  \n \n \n2  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows she has paid, or entered into payment agreements \non six of the alleged debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m). Some of the \nsettlement agreements and/or payment plans preceded the SOR. Applicant is paying \nthese debts first, and then she plans to start making payments on the other six \ndelinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.n). AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established that her financial problems resulted from circumstances \nbeyond her control which contributed to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., three periods \nof unemployment between December 2003 and December 2008; the expenses she \nincurred resulting from the end of a relationship; and unforeseen vehicle repair \nexpenses.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s limited unemployment benefits income did not \nallow her to pay both her past financial obligations and her day-to-day living expenses. \nThis resulted in her falling behind on her financial obligations. When unemployed, she \nsought employment. She contacted her creditors to let them know she was unemployed \nand of her resulting financial problems. Once she found work, Applicant contacted her \ncreditors, negotiated settlement agreements, and established payment plans to resolve \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \nany outstanding balances. Because of the number of creditors, Applicant could not \nafford to pay all the creditors at the same time. She has been paying her creditors one \nat a time. Although Applicant could have been more diligent addressing her delinquent \ndebts, I find Applicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to show she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \nI also find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) apply.3 There are clear indications that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved and her financial problems appear to \nbe under control. She made good-faith efforts to resolve her debts prior to receipt of her \nSOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (f), and (e) do not apply. The financial considerations concerns are \nmitigated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a substantial number \nof debts that have been delinquent for a number of years. \n \nApplicant has successfully worked for several government contractors, and has \nheld access to classified information for many years. There is no evidence she has ever \ncompromised classified information or committed any security violations. Applicant \nexpressed sincere remorse for her financial mistakes and credibly promised to repay \nher creditors. She established circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her debts. Moreover, she established she has been financially \nresponsible under the circumstances.  \n \n3  AG \u00b6 20(c) applies only partially because there is no evidence that Applicant participated in \nfinancial counseling. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \nShe initiated good-faith efforts to resolve her debts after she found employment.4 \nThere are indications that her financial problem is being resolved or is under control. \nShe is paying her delinquent debts within her means -- one at a time.5 These factors \nshow responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . \u201cestablished a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \n \n4  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n5  The government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit reports, \ninvestigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the government \nfrom subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context to pay \nlegitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future revocation of a \nsecurity clearance. The security clearance process provides a clear warning to Applicants about the \nimportance of maintaining financial responsibility. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nthe SOR.

May 21, 2008) \n(internal citations omitted).]  \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, received February 23, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 2.a and 2.b of the SOR with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Steven R. Freeman, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 13,\n2008. On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nH and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 23, 2009, and answered\nthrough Counsel. Applicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I\nreceived the case assignment on April 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nMay 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 16, 2009. The\ngovernment presented one witness and offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-5, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of\nJune 29, 2009\n\n2\none witness. He submitted Exhibits A-B without objection. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on June 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received February 23, 2009, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 2.a and 2.b of the SOR with explanations. He also\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1996 and obtained his undergraduate degree in 2000. He received a\nMaster of Business Administration in 2007. He has never married and has a child from a\nprevious relationship. He is currently engaged to be married and has a child with his\nintended wife. He has been with his current employer since 2001 (GE 1). He has not\npreviously held a security clearance.\nApplicant started smoking marijuana when he was 17 years old in high school.\nHe smoked marijuana from March 1996 until May 2008. The frequency varied, but he\nestimates that he used the illegal drug approximately 100 times. His use diminished in\nfrequency from once a week with friends, when he was younger, at parties to four times\na year in a social setting. His first son was born in 1999 and lived with Applicant\u2019s\ngirlfriend. At that point in 1999, he used marijuana very infrequently (Tr. 92). He has\nnever used marijuana in his home with his family (GE 1).\nIn 2001, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana and possession of\nparaphernalia. He was a passenger in an automobile with a friend who had used\nmarijuana. An officer stopped the vehicle and found marijuana and drug paraphernalia\nin the glove compartment of the car (Tr. 17). He was arrested and spent a night in jail\n(Tr. 94). As a first time offender, Applicant was given an assessment and education\nprogram. The court \u201cdiversion program\u201d allowed the charges to remain on an inactive\ndocket. Applicant voluntarily completed the program by attending class for five to ten\nweeks (Tr. 95). The charges were nolle prosequi. His record is now expunged (GE 5). \nApplicant completed his security clearance application on August 13, 2008, and\nlisted his use of marijuana from March 1996 until May 2008. He reported the number of\ntimes as 100+. He also noted that he used marijuana \u201cmuch more frequently than I do\nnow\u201d; the usage now is 4 times a year in a social setting;\u201d and \u201cat no time does this\nsubstance enter my household\u201d (Tr. 82).\nAn agent from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interviewed Applicant\nin September 2008. She prepared a report of investigation concerning the interview (GE\n3). The agent knew of Applicant\u2019s admitted drug use before the interview. During the\ninterview Applicant was candid and admitted to the agent that although he had not used\nmarijuana since May 2008, he did not \u201cknow if he will use marijuana in the future\u201d (GE\n\n3\n4). Applicant elaborated that if he learns that his job would be negatively impacted by\nmarijuana use, he would stop to keep his job. The agent believed the interview was\nunique because she does not recall anyone answering the question concerning \u201cfuture\nintent\u201d in the way that Applicant did. At the hearing, she acknowledged that she could\nnot remember verbatim what Applicant said when she asked a follow up question about\nunder what circumstances would he or would he not use marijuana in the future (Tr. 35).\nShe remembers that he said if he learns that his job would be negatively impacted, then\nhe would not use marijuana. The agent testified that Applicant was cooperative and\ncandid during the interview (Tr. 39). \nApplicant\u2019s future wife testified at the hearing. She has known Applicant for four\nyears. She and Applicant reside together in their own home. They have one child as a\nresult of their relationship who lives with them. Applicant\u2019s son from his previous\nrelationship and his future wife\u2019s oldest daughter from her first marriage also live in the\nhome (Tr. 48).\nApplicant\u2019s future wife knew about Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana. She\nacknowledged that she smoked marijuana with him when they first met about four years\nago. She explained that he has changed his lifestyle and habits because of their\nblended family. He completely stopped using marijuana in part due to her condition that\nif they would be married, she did not want that to be a part of the marriage or impact on\ntheir family (Tr. 52). She is not working outside of the home at the current time because\nshe is expecting their second child. She and Applicant spend weekends with the\nchildren. Applicant puts the children first. They attend sporting events and PTA (Tr. 54).\nThey socialize with other families in the neighborhood. \nApplicant does not have friends who smoke marijuana. He comes home every\nevening after work (Tr. 56). He has relocated to a different community and he\nassociates with families with children (Tr. 82). He acknowledged that his first son was in\nthe custody of his wife during the earlier years when he was still using marijuana\noccasionally. His life consists of work and home activities (Tr. 83).\nApplicant has received a promotion and a raise every year for the past nine\nyears. He has been promoted to Program Operations Manager (Tr. 87). He enjoys his\nwork and applied for a security clearance so that he could enhance his career\nopportunities. He has a family to support and wants to remain financially responsible for\nthe entire household. \nApplicant was candid, open, forthright and credible at the hearing. He was\nthoughtful in his responses to questions concerning the exact number of times he used\nmarijuana after 2001 until 2008. He believed it may have been once or twice a year (Tr.\n102). He was also honest when he admitted that in completing his security\nquestionnaire in August 2008, he answered to the best of his ability. He noted in\nresponse to his December 2008 interrogatories to DOHA that he objected to the agent\u2019s\ndescription of his comment concerning future use. He believes he reported to the agent\nthat he would not use in the future because he understood what the ramifications were\n\n4\nfor his career and for his family (Tr. 113). He acknowledged at the hearing that he made\na firm decision not to use marijuana in the future after the interview with the agent (Tr.\n114).\nApplicant signed a Statement of Intent on June 16, 2009 that he would \u201crefrain\nfrom engaging in any illegal drug activity whatsoever, including but not limited to using\nmarijuana or any other illegal drug\u201d (AE A). In the event that [I] fail to live up to the\npromises contained in this Statement of Intent, I hereby consent to the automatic\nrevocation of my security clearance, should [I] be in the possession of a security\nclearance. \nApplicant took a drug urine test in June 2009. He tested negative for nine\npossible drugs (AE B). He conceded that this was not a random drug sample (Tr. 76).\nHe is willing to submit to random drug testing at any time (Tr. 78).\nApplicant testified credibly at the hearing and consistent with his security\nclearance application. He was candid in his interview with the agent investigating his\ncase. He has no contact with friends with whom he used marijuana. He is more settled\nand focused on his career. He has received promotions at work. He will be married very\nsoon and has a blended family to care for. His social time is spent with other families in\nthe neighborhood. Marijuana use is not part of that culture, and is viewed as immature\nand not responsible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant admitted using marijuana from 1996 until May 2008 approximately 100 times.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\n\n6\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s\ndrug use was more frequent from 1996 until 2001. He used marijuana at parties when\nhe was single. His use over the last six years is fairly described as casual and\ninfrequent. Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in May 2008, I find that this mitigating\ncondition partially applies. Applicant is credible in his testimony concerning his\ncommitment to his family and home situation. He and his intended wife are expecting\ntheir second child. He has a family. I do not find the marijuana use would likely recur\nunder his new circumstances. \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d \nApplicant signed a Statement of Intent. He does not associate with friends who\nsmoke marijuana. He is living in a different community with his family. He spends his\ntime at work and attending events with his family. He has focused on his career and\nwants to enhance his career opportunities. He has not used marijuana since May 2008.\nWhile his abstention from marijuana use for one year might not in another situation\nnecessarily constitute an appropriate period of abstinence, given the minimal marijuana\nuse by Applicant and his change in environment, I conclude that a year\u2019s abstinence is\nappropriate. He has shown an honesty and this goes to his trustworthiness for a\nsecurity clearance. On this credible record, it is extremely unlikely that Applicant would\nreturn to illegal drug use. His firm commitment and his signed statement are sufficient\nfor mitigation under 26(b).\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30, \u201dCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulation.\u201d\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 31(a) an \u201csingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d may be potentially\ndisqualifying. Also AG 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d is a\npotential disqualifying condition. As discussed above, Applicant admitted using\nmarijuana from 1996 until 2008 approximately 100 times. Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana\nuse and 2001 charge for possession of marijuana is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a)\nand 31(c).\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a) the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\n\n7\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 30(d) it may be mitigating where \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nFor the reasons discussed above, I  find that Applicant has provided mitigation\nunder this guideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) theextent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant used marijuana when he\nwas young in 1999. He smoked the illegal drug with friends at social gatherings. He was\ncharged with marijuana possession in 2001. He attended courses and completed a\ncourt diversion program. He has no conviction on his record. It was expunged. He has\nno other criminal record but he continued to smoke marijuana infrequently until May\n2008.\nApplicant has worked successfully for the same company for the past eight\nyears. He has received promotions and raises. He is now engaged to be married. He\nand his future wife own a home together. He is focused on his family life with his future\nwife and children. His marijuana usage in the past seven years dramatically decreased\nand then completely stopped. He is fully committed to his family. He understands the\nimportance of responsibility. He wants to enhance his career and provide for his family.\nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use on his security clearance and in his\ninterview with a government agent. He was candid and forthright at all times. He was\nbrutally honest when answering all questions. He has not used marijuana since May\n\n8\n2008. He was credible in his statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. He\nunderstands the ramifications of any illegal drug use. He is willing to submit to any\nrandom drug tests. He has demonstrated a trustworthiness in his security clearance\napplication process. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all the reasons\ndiscussed above, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from\nhis drug involvement and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn January 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 12, 2009, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on April 17, 2009. A complete copy of the file \nof relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nJune 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on April 25, 2009. He responded with a \nletter dated May 12, 2009, and two attachments. Department Counsel did not object to \nhis response. The letter and two attachments are marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C, and admitted. The case was assigned to me on June 2, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Navy from 2001 through 2004. He attended college from 2004 through \n2006. He has never been married and has no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant incurred student loans to pay for his college education. He was \nemployed by a company from May 2006 through February 2008. He maintained his \nstudent loan payments while he was employed. He notified his employer in February \n2008 that he would be leaving the company in about a month to work with another \ncompany. His company decided to immediately end his employment. His SF 86 does \nnot reflect that he ever worked for the company that was going to employ him. Applicant \ndid not explain why he did not work for that company. He was unemployed from \nFebruary 2008 until he obtained a job with his current employer in July 2008.2   \n \n \nWhen Applicant became unemployed in February 2008, he contacted the holder \nof his student loans. He told the creditor that he was unemployed and could not make \nthe scheduled payments at that time. The company would not provide him with an \nalternate payment plan. He did not make his student loan payments while he was \nunemployed and the loans went into a collection status. He contacted the lender after \nhe obtained his current job. He agreed to pay $372 per month starting in September \n2008. He went overseas for his job. He told the collection company handling the loans \nthat he would maintain the $372 monthly payments until he returned from overseas in \nFebruary or March 2009. He would then pay the loans in full.3  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the two delinquent student loans, one for $6,269 and the other \nfor $12,442. Applicant submitted documentation establishing that the $6,269 loan was \nsettled in full and the $12,442 loan was paid in full. The record contains no other \nindications of any other financial problems.4  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. Information in this paragraph was obtained from Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) dated July 28, 2008. \n \n2 Items 4-8; AE A-C. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had two student loans that became delinquent. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant could not maintain the payments on his student loans when he \nbecame unemployed in February 2008. It is unclear why he did not start working with \n\n \n5 \n \nthe company where he planned to work after he gave notice to his employer. Without \nmore information, I am unable to find that his unemployment was a circumstance that \nwas largely beyond his control. He acted responsibly by making payment arrangements \nwhen he obtained his current employment. He made payments while he was overseas. \nAfter he returned from overseas he paid the larger loan in full and settled in full the \nsmaller loan. He made a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors and his \nfinancial problem has been resolved. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Applicant\u2019s student loans became \ndelinquent when he was unemployed. He is now employed and has paid or settled the \nstudent loans. There are no other issues of concern, financial or otherwise. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

On February 11, 2009, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nSeptember 18, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n3\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n2\naddressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline J (criminal\n3\nconduct) and Guideline D (sexual behavior).\nOn March 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 7, 2009. I convened a hearing on June 10, 2009,\nat which the parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented seven exhibits\n(Gx. 1 - 7), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, proffered four\nexhibits (Ax. A - D), and presented five witnesses. DOHA received the transcript of\nhearing (Tr.) on July 1, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged Applicant was arrested on August 2,\n2005, and charged with Solicitation of a Child by Computer to Commit an Unlawful Sex\nAct, a felony; that on August 7, 2006, he pleaded guilty to Attempted Solicitation of a\nChild by Computer to Commit an Unlawful Sex Act, a misdemeanor, for which he was\nsentenced to 90 days in jail (suspended), placed on 36 months of supervised probation,\nwas assessed a fine and court costs, and was ordered to complete counseling and\ntreatment, and to have no contact with the victim or the victim\u2019s family.  (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The\ngovernment also alleged that Applicant\u2019s probation was to run through August 6, 2009.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b)\nUnder Guideline J, the government also alleged that Applicant pleaded nolo\ncontendere to a misdemeanor loitering and prowling charge in 1992, when he was 18\nyears old. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) However, at the hearing, Department Counsel indicated there\nwould be no information presented about this allegation. (Tr. 13) Accordingly, that\nallegation is resolved for the Applicant.\nUnder Guideline D, the government alleged the same information as contained in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations under Guideline J, but did not\ndirectly respond to the allegation under Guideline D. After reviewing the pleadings, the\ntranscript, and exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 36 years old. He served in the U.S. Army Special Forces from\nJanuary 1993 until he received a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions in\nSeptember 2007. He was hired by his current employer in May 2008. (Gx. 1) Several\nwitnesses from his company testified in glowing terms about Applicant\u2019s performance\nand reliability. The company co-owner stated that he has been \u201ca model employee\u201d who\nhas exhibited \u201cexemplary judgment\u201d during his tenure there. (Tr. 54) While on active\nduty, Applicant distinguished himself in combat during the early days of Operation Iraqi\nFreedom in 2003. (Ax. D)\nApplicant has been married twice. He and his current wife were married in June\n2002 and are raising her 10-year-old child from a previous marriage. Applicant\u2019s first\n\n3\nmarriage began in January 1997 and ended through divorce in January 2001. Applicant\nand his first wife had one child (now age 9) together. (Gx. 1; Tr. 98 - 100) During the\nlater stages of his first marriage, Applicant suspected his ex-wife was having an affair.\nTo confirm his suspicions, Applicant began contacting her using his internet service\nprovider\u2019s instant messaging (IM) program, a near real-time on-line \u201cchatroom,\u201d to pose\nas someone else, ostensibly so he might trick her into an admission of adulterous\nconduct. While he was unsuccessful in that effort, Applicant became a habitual user of\nIM to chat with all manner of people on the internet. (Gx. 5)\nIn April 2005, Applicant initiated an on-line IM conversation with an 11-year-old\ngirl. He estimates that he and the girl chatted had at least 30 IM conversations between\nApril and late July 2005. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 115 - 118) At least three times (on May\n12, May 23, and June 27, 2005), Applicant asked the girl if she wanted him to perform\noral sex on her or if she wanted to do the same for him. (Gx. 3) He also attempted to\narrange a meeting with the girl at least three times. (Gx. 3; Tr. 116 - 117)  At some\npoint, the girl\u2019s mother became aware of the sexual nature of Applicant\u2019s conversation\nand called the police. In July 2005, while he was unknowingly communicating with a\nparent or a law enforcement officer instead of the child, Applicant arranged what he\nthought would be a meeting with the girl, but no meeting actually happened. On August\n2, 2005, police executed a search warrant at Applicant\u2019s house and he was arrested. He\nwas initially charged with Solicitation of a Child by Computer to Commit an Unlawful Sex\nAct, a felony. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 5)\nA year later, Applicant negotiated a plea bargain through which he pleaded guilty\nto the lesser included misdemeanor offense of attempting the same offense. He was\ngiven a suspended 90-day jail sentence and placed on supervised probation for 36\nmonths. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 1) He completed his probation on August 6, 2009. (Tr.\n123; Gx. 4) He was also ordered to complete counseling and therapy, which he did after\nattending group sessions between November 2006 and August 2008. (Ax. B; Ax. C; Tr.\n106 - 107) As a result of his conviction, Applicant was administratively discharged from\nthe Army despite the fact an earlier administrative separation board around the time of\nhis arrest recommended he be retained in the service. (Gx. 5; Tr. 95, 102 - 105)\nApplicant\u2019s witnesses testified they were aware of his arrest and conviction. He\nspoke with three of them about details of his arrest, but it appears he told them that he\nthought the person on the other end of his IM chats was an adult (Tr. 44 - 45, 56 - 57,\n67 - 68) He also told a government investigator during his background investigation that\nhe thought he was conversing with an adult. He has also suggested that he never\nintended to meet anyone and that he was interested in \u201crole-playing entertainment.\u201d (Tr.\n95 - 96, 125; Gx. 5) However, a transcript of his IM chats with the victim shows that he\nknew and was attracted by the fact she was a minor. For example, on April 5, 2005,\nApplicant asked how old she was and was told she was \u201c11.\u201d That day, the girl\u2019s mother\nwas also present with the girl and the conversation was benign. On May 12, 2005, he\nagain confirmed she was 11 years old and, after being told her mother was not home,\nasked the girl if she liked oral sex. The session that day ended when the girl indicated\nher father was home. On June 27, 2005, after being told the girl\u2019s mother was not home,\nhe again suggested he wanted to perform oral sex on her. (Gx. 3) Finally, Applicant\nknew at the time what he was doing was illegal and inappropriate. On June 29, 2005,\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n4\nApplicant said, \u201c[M]y wife would not like me talking to a hot little [sic] 11y/o...you can\u2019t\ntell ANYONE!\u201d (Gx. 3; emphasis in original)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n5\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 12 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior) and AG \u00b6 30\n(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct). \nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n6\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe security concern raised by the allegation about possible criminal conduct by\nthe Applicant is that such conduct \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30.\nThe government\u2019s information is sufficient to show, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, that\nApplicant was charged with a felony sexual crime and was convicted of a lesser\nincluded misdemeanor offense of attempting the same sexual crime. He was given a\nsuspended jail sentence and was placed on supervised probation for three years. The\nrecord requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted). \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was still on probation as alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.b. This would require application of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 31(d)\n(individual is currently on parole or probation). However, his probation was scheduled to\nend on August 6, 2009, while this decision was pending. Available information tends to\nshow that he has completed all probation requirements, and it is likely that his probation\nended on time. I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.b for the Applicant.\nIn response, Applicant argued that his conduct was isolated and is now more\nthan four years removed. He also points to the successful completion of his probation\nand counseling requirements, and to the excellent reputation he enjoys at work despite\napparent knowledge by his colleagues of his past adverse conduct. Such information\nrequires consideration of whether to apply the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32(a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement). \nI conclude that Applicant does not benefit from these adjudicative factors.\nBetween August 2005 and August 2009, Applicant\u2019s conduct was regulated, first by his\npending criminal prosecution, then by his probationary status, 21 months of court-\nordered counseling, and by his 90-day jail sentence, which could have been reinstated if\nhe broke the law before his probation ended. He has not established a sufficient record\n\n6\nof acceptable conduct purely of his own volition that would support a finding that he will\nnot repeat his criminal conduct in the future. On this score, I have also considered the\nstatement by Applicant\u2019s counselor that he is \u201ca low level risk for recidivism.\u201d (Ax. C)\nAside from the fact that Applicant went through 21 months of counseling and the\ncounselor\u2019s conclusion itself, there is insufficient information about the probability for\nrecidivism. This statement, taken in context of the record as a whole, is not persuasive.\nMore important, however, is Applicant\u2019s continued minimization of his conduct\nthrough his statements to a government investigator and to the witnesses who testified\nfor him at the hearing. Questions persist about his rehabilitation and, going forward, his\njudgment and candor. The information contained in Gx. 3 is directly at odds with\nApplicant\u2019s statements and his testimony about his intent to have unlawful sexual\ncontact with a minor. In light of all of the information bearing on whether Applicant\u2019s past\ncriminal conduct does not cast doubt on his \u201creliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgement,\u201d I do not conclude that either AG \u00b6 32(a) or AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. On balance, I\nconclude Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion and has failed to mitigate the\nfacts established by the government\u2019s information.\nSexual Behavior\nAnother security concern raised by Applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction for a 2005\nsexual offense is, as stated in AG \u00b6 12, that:\n[s]exual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality\nor emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in the Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nOver a three-month period in 2005, Applicant knowingly and repeatedly tried,\nthrough internet instant messaging, to engage an 11-year-old girl in inappropriate\nsexual conversation, telling her he wanted to have oral sex with her and suggesting she\ncould do the same for him. He tried several times to arrange a meeting with her to\nactually engage in those sex acts. He was arrested and charged with a felony sexual\ncriminal offense, and later pleaded guilty to a lesser included misdemeanor charge. Part\nof his sentence required him to participate in extensive counseling for sex offenders.\nThe foregoing requires application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 13(a) (sexual\nbehavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted) and\nAG \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of\ndiscretion or judgment). As to AG \u00b6 13(d), Applicant was over 30 years old and a long-\nserving member of the Army. He, too, is a parent with a young child. His conduct in this\nregard reflected  significant flaws in his discretion and judgment. Those flaws have been\npreserved by his current attempts to minimize the true scope of his conduct.\nBased on the same information Applicant presented to mitigate the criminal\nconduct concerns discussed above, I have weighed the applicability of the mitigating\n\n See footnote 7 supra. \n8\n7\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so\ninfrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment),\nand AG \u00b6 14(c) (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress). For the same reasons AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do not apply, AG \u00b6 14(b)\ndoes not apply. Applicant has attempted to minimize his conduct and he has not\nestablished that he will continue to eschew such behavior in the future without fear of\nthe potential consequences of probation and a suspended jail sentence. I also decline\nto apply AG \u00b6 14(c). While it may be that his arrest was the subject of a local news\narticle, it also appears he knowingly misled three of his witnesses, in part, to help his\nresponse to the government\u2019s case, and, in part, because he did not want the true\nscope and nature of his conduct to be known at work. All of the information bearing on\nthis issue of whether to apply any of the Guideline D mitigating conditions shows that\nthe Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion in response to the government\u2019s\ncase.  \nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and applied the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors under Guidelines D and J. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 36 years old and\nserved his country for 14 years in the most honorable and arduous way. Aside from the\nadverse information alleged in the SOR, he appears to have conducted himself\nprofessionally and responsibly in both his military and his civilian capacities. His\ncolleagues and his supervisors at work and from his Army career regard Applicant as an\nexcellent, courageous soldier, and as a reliable, trustworthy, and valuable employee.\nHowever, none of the positive recommendations presented herein appears to have\nbeen fully informed about his conduct. It may be that even with full disclosure of his\nconduct, those same witnesses and references would not change anything they have\nsaid about Applicant. But because he has not been forthcoming about his conduct,\nreasonable doubts remain about whether his past adverse conduct and poor judgment\nwill recur. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.  \n8\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance\nis denied.\n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action\nis based on Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems or difficulties (delinquent debts).\nThe record contains sufficient evidence to establish that (1) her financial difficulties\nwere, in part, due to circumstances largely beyond her control, (2) she made a good-\nfaith effort to repay or otherwise resolve debts, (3) she has a reasonable basis to\ndispute some debts, and (4) she has taken positive steps to resolve the situation and it\nappears likely that she will favorably resolve the situation. Accordingly, as explained in\nmore detail below, this case is decided for  Applicant. \nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n See Exhibit A\u201312. \n2\n Tr. 33\u201334. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on March 27, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F for\nfinancial considerations. The SOR also recommended submitting the case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 1, 2009, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 8, 2009. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nJuly 16, 2009. The record was left open until July 31, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. Those matters were timely submitted and are marked\nand admitted without objections as follows: (1) Applicant Exhibit A-15\u2013cover letter and\ndispute letter, dated July 20, 2009; and (2) Applicant Exhibit A-16\u2013cover letter and\ndispute letter, dated February 23, 2009. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received July\n22, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 10 delinquent debts ranging in amounts\nfrom $65 to $5,861 for a total of about $15,000. Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR were\nmixed. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old senior software engineer. She has held her current job\nsince September 2007, and her annual salary is about $92,000. She and her husband\nseparated in 1998, and they divorced in 2000. She has three children, sons, ages 26,\n23, and 11. Her 11-year-old son was diagnosed with autism and is a special-education\nstudent.   \n2\nIn addition to her salary, Applicant now receives about $900 monthly in child\nsupport.  This was not always the case, as Applicant had to take legal action to obtain\n3\n\n Tr. 112\u2013113. \n4\n Tr. 27\u201332. \n5\n Tr. 42\u201347; Exhibit A-13. \n6\n Tr. 47\u201349; Exhibit A\u20132. \n7\n Tr. 49\u201351; Exhibit A\u20133. \n8\n3\npayment and obtain a judgment for an arrearage in the amount of about $30,000, but\nshe subsequently waived the judgment in about 2004 or 2005.4\nApplicant obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in 1981. She started\nher first job with a defense contractor the same year. She has worked in the defense\nindustry since 1981 except for the period 2000-2007, when she worked as a software\ntest engineer for a large communications company. She was laid off from that job in\nFebruary 2007, and was unemployed until starting her current position. She received\nfour months of severance pay as well as a couple of months of unemployment\ncompensation during this period. She was earning about $82,000 annually when she\nwas laid off. \nIn addition to the seven-month period of unemployment, Applicant incurred\nunexpected expenses after her job layoff in 2007 for her middle son\u2019s college\neducation.  In summary, due to a snafu at the financial aid office, Applicant spent about\n5\n$3,200 for her son\u2019s tuition and living expenses. The combination of her unemployment\nand the unexpected financial aid problem contributed to some of the financial difficulties\nalleged in the SOR, which are addressed below. \nApplicant disputes an unpaid $144 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  She\n6\ncontends the account was resolved in 2008, and presented documentary information\nsupporting her contention. \nApplicant admits an unpaid $1,565 charged-off account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.7\nThe debt stems from a credit card account, and it is marital debt that Applicant ended\nup addressing. She settled the account by making two payments of $960 in June and\nJuly 2009.\nApplicant disputes an unpaid $76 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.  She\n8\ndisputed the account in writing in February 2009, and a credit bureau deleted it from the\ncredit report in March 2009.\n\n Tr. 51\u201352; Exhibit A\u20134. \n9\n Exhibit A\u201311. \n10\n Tr. 61\u201373; Exhibits A\u20135, A\u20136, and A\u20137. \n11\n Tr. 93. \n12\n Tr. 114. \n13\n Tr. 52\u201354; Exhibit A\u20138.  \n14\n Tr. 54\u201355; Exhibit A\u20139.\n15\n4\nApplicant disputes an unpaid $303 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.  She\n9\ndisputed the account in writing in February 2009, and has not received a reply from the\ncredit bureau. It does not appear on a July 2009 credit report.10\nApplicant admits that her mortgage loan is past due and in foreclosure as alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1.e.  Applicant has not lived in this house since July 2008, when she and her\n11\nyoungest son moved into an apartment in a nearby community and a different school\ndistrict, which provides superior special education services. She rented the house to a\nclose friend of the family. The family friend and his roommates rather quickly failed to\npay rent and vacated the house in about November 2008, and the house has remained\nvacant. The last mortgage payment was made in December 2008 or January 2009.12\nApplicant hired a third-party company to assist her with a loan-modification request in\nMarch 2009. That effort proved costly and useless as the third-party company charged\nher the equivalent of one monthly payment and did not provide the promised services.\nApplicant contacted the mortgage company the following month and submitted the\nnecessary paperwork in support of her loan-modification request. The mortgage\ncompany denied the request on May 14, 2009. Applicant then decided to sell the house,\npossibly a short sale, and entered into a real estate listing agreement with a broker on\nJuly 5, 2009. The property is now listed for sale and for rent. Applicant understands the\nforeclosure action is delayed or halted for about 120 days to give her a chance to sell\nthe property.13\nApplicant admits a $749 past-due account as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f.  This debt\n14\nstems from an installment loan for an expensive car Applicant bought in 2006. She has\nmissed the monthly payment from time-to-time, but the loan is now current as of July\n2009.\nApplicant disputes a $2,054 past-due account as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g.  This\n15\ndebt stemmed from a mortgage loan that Applicant refinanced with her current\nmortgagee in 2004. The account was paid in full in November 2004.\n\n Tr. 55\u201357; Exhibit A\u201310. \n16\n Tr. 59\u201360; Exhibit A\u201316. \n17\n Exhibit A\u201311. \n18\n Tr. 60\u201361; Exhibit A\u201315. \n19\n Tr. 102\u2013104; Exhibit A\u201314. \n20\n Tr. 73, 111\u2013112. \n21\n Department of Navy v.

This debt\n16\nresulted from a shortfall or gap in insurance coverage for an auto that was in an\naccident. Applicant settled the debt by making three payments of $903 in April, May,\nand June 2009. \nApplicant disputes an unpaid $65 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i.  She\n17\ndisputed the account in writing in February 2009, and has not received a reply from the\ncredit bureau. The debt does not appear on a July 2009 credit report.18\nApplicant disputes an unpaid $193 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j.19\nApplicant is disputing this debt with the assistance of counsel. A reply to the dispute\nletter is yet to be received. \nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant settled an unpaid $1,741 collection\nabout in about July 2009.  She settled the account by making a single payment of\n20\n$750.\nWith her salary and the child-support payment, Applicant estimates that she has\na positive monthly cash flow and is able to meet her existing financial obligations.  \n21\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n22\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n23\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n24\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n25\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n26\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n27\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n28\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n30\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n31\n6\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n24\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n25\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n26\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n27\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n28\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n29\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.30\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.31\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n32\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n33\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n34\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n35\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19\u00a9. \n36\n7\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n32\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n33\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n34\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nBoth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions should be analyzed in light of the\nrecord. The record shows Applicant has a history of financial difficulties. It also shows\nthat she has taken action on the ten debts in the SOR as follows: (1) she disputed, in\nwriting, five accounts; (2) she settled two accounts; (3) she paid in full her prior\nmortgage loan via refinancing; (4) she brought her car loan current; and (5) she is in the\nprocess of resolving her mortgage loan. She also settled another account not alleged in\nthe SOR. And the record shows that circumstances largely beyond her control\ncontributed to her financial difficulties. \nTurning first to the disqualifying conditions, Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n35\n36\nGuideline F. These facts and circumstances are more than sufficient to establish the\ntwo disqualifying conditions noted above, and it suggests financial irresponsibility as\nwell.\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n37\n8\nTurning next to the mitigating conditions under the guideline, there are six that\nmay mitigate security concerns, and they are as follows:  \n37\nThe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nThe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol;\nThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\nThe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nThe affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nThe second, third, fourth, and fifth mitigating conditions are relevant to this case and are\ndiscussed below.\nThe second mitigating condition\u2014circumstances beyond one\u2019s control\u2014applies\nin Applicant\u2019s favor. Her unemployment in 2007, followed by the student financial aid\nsnafu in 2007, followed by tenants who failed to pay in 2008, were all circumstances\nlargely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Individually and combined, these circumstances put\nApplicant in difficult positions\u2014forcing her to look for a new job, coming up with money\nto pay for her son\u2019s college expenses, and leaving her with an empty house instead of\npaying tenants. She acted reasonably under these challenging circumstances by finding\nemployment, taking care of her family, and doing what was possible to resolve the\nmortgage loan. \nThe third mitigating condition\u2014indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. Applicant has taken positive steps to\naddress her financial difficulties, and she is at a point now where it appears likely that\nshe will resolve her financial problems, the mortgage loan being of most concern. \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n38\n9\nThe fourth mitigating condition\u2014initiating a good-faith effort\u2014applies in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Applicant paid in full one debt, settled two debts, and brought a past-\ndue account current. She settled another account not alleged in the SOR. Also, she is\ntaking reasonable and realistic steps to resolve her past-due mortgage. Her actions fall\nwithin the meaning of initiating a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve debts.\nThe fifth mitigating condition\u2014reasonable basis to dispute\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor. Applicant disputes five of the ten debts in the SOR, and she has received\nfavorable results in some cases and others are pending. And most important, Applicant\nprovided documentary evidence to establish her disputes.\nTo summarize the evidence in mitigation, the record contains sufficient evidence\nto establish that (1) her financial difficulties were, in part, due to circumstances largely\nbeyond her control, (2) she has made a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve\ndebts, (3) she has a reasonable basis to dispute some debts, and (4) she has taken\npositive steps to resolve the situation and it appears likely that she will favorably resolve\nthe situation. Moreover, Applicant impressed me as an intelligent person who is working\nin a demanding field (software engineering), and she has equal challenges at home with\na 11-year-old son who is receiving special education services for autism. She worked\nthrough a difficult period during 2007\u20132008, when she faced unemployment,\nunexpected college expenses, and unexpected tenant problems. Her persistence and\ntenacity in the face of these problems demonstrate both good character and suitability\nfor access to classified information. Although Applicant did not present a perfect case in\nmitigation, she presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nsecurity concerns. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant. In reaching this\nconclusion, I gave due consideration to the nine-factor whole-person concept.38\nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant met her ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.j:\n \nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn January 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 26, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 26, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 7, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on May 8, 2009.

In \naddition, after a thorough and carefu\nm\n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and has worked for a federal contractor as a Design \nEngineer, since May 2008. He has been married for twelve years and has two children, \nages seven and four. He also has a child, age 17, from a previous relationship. He pays \nchild support for this child and is current in his obligation. Applicant graduated from \ncollege earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2008. His wife i\na\n \n \nApplicant worked for a company from January 1999 to August 2006, when the \ncompany decided to shut down the plant where he worked. Applicant lost his job and \nwas given one year severance pay. He could not hold a full-time job while receiving the \nseverance pay, which was half of the salary he had been earning. Applicant decided to \ngo back to school as a full-time student to earn a degree. Having a college degree \nallowed him the potential of increasing his marketability and career prospects. From \nAugust 2006 until May 2008, Applicant attended college. Around September 2007, \nApplicant\u2019s wife got a part-time job. During the time Applicant attended school he and \nhis family lived off the severance pay he received, which was about $1,800 a month. He \nwas not entitled to unemployment benefits. They also lived off of their savings and he \nworked part-time during the day and attended school at night. He was earning from his \npart-time job about $2,200 a month before taxes. He stated they were paying their bills, \nbut their income was not enough to cover all of their expenses, despite their efforts to \n\u201cmake ends meet.\u201d His severance pay expired in August 2007. They lived month to \nmonth until Applicant graduated in May 2008. He and his wife decided it was best for \nhim to finish his degree, even though they got behind in paying some bills. Applicant\u2019s \nwife started working full time in July 2008, earning approximately $40,000 annually. At \nthe time Applicant started work with his present employer h\n                                            \n1 An explanation about the exhibits was provided by Department Counsel in Hearing Exhibit I. \nApplicant submitted three fax transmissions that included multiple duplicate documents. Some of the \ndocuments were out of order and some are difficult to decipher as to specifically their intended purpose. I \nhave attempted to determine what particular debt applies to the different documents submitted.   \n0, 25-26. \n \n2 Tr. 18-2\n \n3 Tr. 20-32. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s severance pay expired he began to default on some of his \ndebts. He stated that he paid some of bills that were not listed on the SOR.  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($134) and 1.(b) ($34) are medical debts that Applicant\u2019s \ninsurer did not cover. Applicant stated they are the same creditor and the debts were \nincurred about a year ago. He provided a receipt for $145.49 to a medical office. I am \nassuming that this document pertains to these two debts, but no information was \nprovided to show why a lesser amount was paid or if this is the right creditor. Applicant \nfailed to provide an explanation of the document he provided.4 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($12,518) is a credit card debt. Applicant stated he \nstopped making payments on the debt sometime in early March 2007. He explained that \nmoney was very tight at the time and they used the credit card to pay their mortgage \nand car payments. He further explained that he and his wife own their own home but \nthey owe $14,000 in arrearages on the mortgage. They had received a foreclosure \nnotice and are going to restructure their loan with their mortgage company. They \ndefaulted on the loan in October 2007 and made partial payments for a period. They are \nnow making full monthly payments at the required rate and once they have \nreestablished a consistent payment record, the mortgage company will refinance the \nloan. They have owned the house since 1999 and Applicant believes they have \nsufficient equity in it to refinance. Applicant explained it took from May 2008, when he \nbegan full-time employment until February 2009 to get back on track with their mortgage \npayments. Regarding the credit card debt, Applicant negotiated a repayment plan to pay \n$130 a month over five years. He has made several payments to the plan.5 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($170 past due) is for retail store purchases made by \nApplicant\u2019s wife. He stated the debt was past due five months. Based on the additional \ndocuments provided by Applicant it appears that three payments of $45 were made to \nthe same creditor. However, it is too difficult to decipher the documents provided by \nApplicant because he failed to annotate the specific items on his bank statement.6  \n \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.e ($250 past due) is a credit card debt. The balance is \napproximately $14,000. Applicant has a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay \n$210 a month. He has been making payments since January 2009.7 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($149 past due) is for a home equity loan Applicant took \nout for $12,000 to allow his wife to stay home with the children and not work. He stated \nit is current as of January 2009 and provided documentation.8 \n \n N, Q, and R. \n6; AE G, I, N, Q and R. \nI, N, Q and R; GE 3 at page 2.  \n \n4 Tr. 33-37; AE R. \n \n5 Tr. 38-50; AE I, L,\n \n6 Tr. 53-5\n \n7 Tr. 56-60; AE A, G, \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($12,514) is a loan for a motorcycle Applicant purchased \nin March 2006 prior to the time he knew he was going to be laid off from work. Applicant \nsold the motorcycle and settled the debt for $5,245.9 \n \n \nApplicant also owes approximately $6,000 on a car lease that expired in April \n2009, due to overage on the vehicle\u2019s mileage. He stated they pay this creditor $160 a \nmonth for this debt. Applicant also has approximately $23,000 in deferred student loans \nthat are owed. His wife also has student loans that are deferred, but he does not know \nhow much she owes.10  \n \n \nApplicant provided a budget and stated he and his wife have not had any \nfinancial counseling. It is unclear if their budget is realistic. They do not have cable \ntelevision, internet, or a land line phone. Their budget is tight, but they are making it. He \nstated he feels trapped because of money. His intention is to put 8% of his income into \na 401k plan and to pay all of his debts and live debt free. They do not have any credit \ncards. He stated it took him awhile to see the problem and his wife needs to change the \nway she thinks about money. He stated they both \u201cget it.\u201d He believes he is making \nbetter financial choices.11  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n8 Tr. 60-63; AE K. \n \n9 Tr. 63-66; AE B, C and D.  \n \n10 Tr. 66-76; GE 3 page 3. I have not considered for disqualifying purposes Applicant\u2019s other \ndebts that are not alleged. However, I have considered them when analyzing his complete financial \npicture and in my whole person analysis.  \n \n11 Tr. 72-83. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \non as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nn 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnal sis \n \nuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nity concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \nnded is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nnds.  \ns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likew\n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant h\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.

However, considering the \nloss of income, I am not entirely convinced that he and his wife had a well thought out \nplan on how to pay their bills and live within their means during this austere period of \ntime. Applicant\u2019s wife did not start a full-time job until after Applicant went back to work \nfull-time. Instead they financed their expenses by taking loans and then failing to pay \nthem on time.

I am concerned that without personal financial counseling \nand a realistic budget that he and his wife agree to scrupulous comply with, Applicant \nwill again have difficulty paying his bills.

Applicant lost his job and accepted \nseverance pay and decided to go back to school. He worked part-time during this \nperiod. His wife began part-time work later and is now working full-time. Applicant got \nbehind in paying his bills during this period. With two incomes Applicant and his wife are \nmaking inroads at paying off their delinquent debts. Perhaps Applicant could have made \na better financial plan when he went back to school, but under the circumstances I \nbelieve he did the best he could to stay financially afloat while he was finishing school. \nHe opted for completing his education and suffering a short term financial set back, but \nreaping the rewards from his education by providing him with more and higher paying \ncareer opportunities.

During the period of their separation, unbeknownst to the Applicant, his former spouse incurred additional debt, as she handled their finances (Id). This caused much of the Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. He has since engaged the services of a debt consolidation service (DCS); and through their auspices, has addressed many of his past due debts. Furthermore, his current spouse is handling their financial situation, and is doing so in a responsible manner. 1.a. The first debt is to Creditor A in the amount of about $146.

On June 11, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines E and F for the Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 16, 2009.  He\nanswered (Answer) the SOR in writing on July 11, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on July 13, 2009, and I\nreceived the case assignment on August 5, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nAugust 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 15, 2009.\n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 8, which were received without\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A\nthrough D, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on\nSeptember 23, 2009.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nOctober 13, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On October 8, 2009, he submitted\nExhibit E, without objection.  As the undersigned had jury duty on October 13th and\n14th, the record closed on October 15, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.k., and 1.m. of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied the\nfactual allegations in Subparagraphs 1.l., 1.n.~1.p., and 2.a. of the SOR.  \nFinancial Considerations\nThe Applicant and his former spouse separated in 2001 and were divorced in\n2003 (TR at page 30 line 17 to page 31 line 24, and at page 77 line 15 to page 78 line\n20).  During the period of their separation, unbeknownst to the Applicant, his former\nspouse incurred additional debt, as she handled their finances (Id).  This caused much\nof the Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties.  He has since engaged the services of a debt\nconsolidation service (DCS); and through their auspices, has addressed many of his\npast due debts.  Furthermore, his current spouse is handling their financial situation,\nand is doing so in a responsible manner.\n1.a.  The first debt is to Creditor A in the amount of about $146.  The Applicant\nhas paid this debt, as evidenced by correspondence with legal counsel, representing\nthe creditor (TR at page 65 lines 7~23, and AppX E at Encl 5).\n1.b.  The second debt is to Creditor B in the amount of about $1,209.  The\nApplicant avers that his spouse will address this debt, and there is documentation to\nsupport that she is in contact with legal counsel for the creditor (TR at page 35 line 18 to\npage 36 line 13, and AppX A at page 4).\n1.c.  The third debt is to Creditor C in the amount of about $2,328.  The Applicant\nis paying this debt through his DCS, as evidenced by documentation from his DCS and\nfrom the creditor (TR at page 67 lines 13~22, AppX C at pages 4, and 8~9, and AppX E\nat Encl 9).\n1.d. and 1.e.  The fourth and fifth debts are to Creditor D in an amount totaling\nabout $4,670.  The Applicant has settled and paid these debts, as evidenced by\ncorrespondence with the successor creditor to this debt (TR at page 42 line 19 to page\n43 line 12, and AppX E at Encls 2 and 12).\n\n3\n1.f. and 1.m.  The sixth and thirteenth debts are one and the same debt, to\nCreditor F in an amount totaling about $887.  The Applicant has settled and paid this\ndebt, as evidenced by correspondence with the successor creditor to this debt (TR at\npage 68 line 25 to page 70 line 16, and AppX D at pages 3~5).\n1.g.  The seventh debt is to Creditor G in the amount of about $122.  The\nApplicant is paying this debt through his DCS, as evidenced by documentation from his\nDCS and from the creditor (TR at page 70 line 19 to page 71 line 5, AppX C at pages 4,\nand 8~9, and AppX T at Encl 10).\n1.h.  The eighth debt is to Creditor H in the amount of about $14,236.  The\nApplicant has settled and paid this debt, as evidenced by correspondence with the\ncreditor (TR at page 44 line 13 to page 45 line 14, and AppX E at Encl 3).\n1.i.  The ninth debt is to Creditor I in the amount of about $230.  The Applicant is\npaying this debt through his DCS, as evidenced by documentation from his DCS (TR at\npage 45 lines 15~23, and AppX C at pages 4, and 8~9).\n1.j. and 1.n.  The tenth and fourteenth debts are one and the same debt, to\nCreditor J in an amount totaling about $108.  The Applicant is paying this debt through\nhis DCS, as evidenced by documentation from his DCS and from the creditor (TR at\npage 71 line 8 to page 72 line 3, AppX C at pages 4, and 8~9, and AppX T at Encl 13).\n1.k.  The eleventh debt is to Creditor K in the amount of about $1,658.  The\nApplicant is paying this debt through his DCS, as evidenced by documentation from his\nDCS and from the creditor (TR at page 48 line 10 to page 49 line 1, AppX C at pages 4,\nand 8~9, and AppX T at Encl 13).\n1.l.  The twelfth debt is to Creditor L in the amount of about $226.  The Applicant\nhas repeatedly and consistently disputed this debt as not being his (TR at page 49 lines\n2~19, and Answer at page 1).\n1.m. and 1.n. have already been discussed, above.\n1.o.  The fifteenth debt is to Creditor O in the amount of about $7,174.  The\nApplicant has paid this debt, as evidenced by correspondence with the creditor (TR at\npage 72 line 4 to page 73 line 22, and AppX E at Encl 4).\n1.p.  The last debt is to Creditor P in the amount of about $906.  The Applicant\nhas repeatedly and consistently disputed this debt as not being his (TR at page 74 lines\n1~19, and Answer at page 2).\nPersonal Conduct\n2.a.  The Applicant was less than candid when he answered Section 28 on his\nMay 2008 e-QIP (TR at page 32 line 7 to page 34 line 25, and GX 1 at page 39).  He\n\n4\nchecked the \u201cNo\u201d boxes, which asks if he has any debts more that 90 or 180 days past\ndue, in the last seven years ( GX 1 at page 39).  He answered these questions falsely,\nas he was \u201cscared of losing . . . [his] clearance\u201d (TR at page 32 line 7 to page 34 line\n25).  I find this to be a wilful falsification.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  Applicant had significant past due debts that\nhe had been unable to address in a timely fashion.  The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Subparagraph 20(b) applies where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., . . . divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  Here, the Applicant\u2019s former spouse, unbeknownst to the Applicant,\nincurred much of his past due debt, particularly during the two year period of their legal\nseparation.  Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@\nExcept for two debts that he has consistently disputed as not being his, the Applicant\nhas addressed all of the other alleged past debts through debt consolidation, settlement\nor payment.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nParagraph 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\n\n6\nDisqualifying Condition under Subparagraph 16(a) applies.  It provides that the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire . . . or similar form used to conduct investigations . . .\u201d may be\ndisqualifying.  I can find no countervailing Mitigating Condition here, as Applicant admits\nhe falsified his e-QIP for fear of losing his clearance.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole person concept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  His manager speaks most highly of the\nApplicant (AppX E at Encl 1).  However, the record evidence leaves me with questions\nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nPersonal Conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.p.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated she has experienced financial problems since 2006, due to health reasons and her inability to work. She has not worked full-time since April 4, 2008, and has had three back surgeries from 2006 to 2008. She experienced a substantial reduction in income from $122,000 annually before her disability to $32,000. She no longer receives income or a disability payment. She admitted that because of the income reduction she has resorted to using credit cards to pay some expenses, which has caused additional financial problems. She is presently not working and living off a meager income. It is unknown what her present health problems are and whether they will affect her ability to work in the future. Applicant admits the debt in SOR \u00b61.a ($982) but disputes the amount, stating that she made a $600 payment, which had not been deducted from the balance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn June 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 7, 2009, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record.

Applicant did not provide additional information. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 8, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6 1.a. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and was employed by a federal contractor from \nSeptember 2007 to November 2008. She served in the Air Force for 20 years and was \nhonorably discharged. \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated she has experienced financial \nproblems since 2006, due to health reasons and her inability to work. She has not \nworked full-time since April 4, 2008, and has had three back surgeries from 2006 to \n2008.

It is unknown what her present health \nproblems are and whether they will affect her ability to work in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant admits the debt in SOR \u00b61.a ($982) but disputes the amount, stating \nthat she made a $600 payment, which had not been deducted from the balance. No \ndocumentation was provided to support her position and her credit report still reports the \nbalance as stated above as owed.1 \n \n \nApplicant denies she owes the debt listed in SOR \u00b61.b ($917) stating that it was \npaid off. She references her credit report of August 2, 2009, which shows a zero \nbalance. No additional documentation was provided.2 \n \n \nApplicant admits that she owes the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b61.c ($1,000) and \nstated that she will address the debt as soon as possible.3 \n \n \nApplicant denies the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($9,000) and 1.e ($8,000) for foreclosed \nmortgages. She stated that the debts were paid upon the completion of a short sale of \n \n1 Item 4 page 24. \n \n2 Item 4 pages 1, 22. \n \n3 Item 4 page 1. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nher home.

She stated that these accounts have been paid in full. \nHer credit report does not reflect her position. She stated she is disputing the debts. \nShe did not provide documentary evidence that she paid the debts or that she has \ndisputed them with the credit bureau.5 \n \n \nApplicant denies the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,000).

She did not provide supporting documents showing the terms of \nthe plans. However, her credit report reflects a reduced past-due balance of $65 and a \nprior monthly payment of $40.7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that she has been unable or unwilling \nto satisfy for a period of time. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nSince 2006, Applicant has had financial problems due to her inability to work \nbecause of health issues. She has not worked full-time since April 2008, and it is \nunknown when or if she will be able to resume employment. She has paid some of her \ndelinquent debts, but others remained unresolved. Due to Applicant\u2019s current health and \nemployment situation, I cannot find that the circumstances are unlikely to recur. I find \nmitigating condition (a) does not apply. Applicant has been on disability since 2008, \nwhich has significantly reduced her income. Applicant\u2019s health predicament was a \ncircumstance beyond her control. She has managed to pay some of her debts. Although \nshe resorted to using credit cards to help pay her bills, I acknowledge that she likely has \ndone the best she could have under the circumstances. I find mitigating condition (b) \napplies. There is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. She is unable \nto pay some of her creditors and resolve some of her delinquent debts. I find it is too \nsoon to determine that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control and being \nresolved. I find mitigating condition (c) does not apply. I find mitigating condition (d) \npartially applies because Applicant has paid some debts and has not ignored her \ncreditors.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military for \n20 years and was honorably discharged. She began experiencing financial problems \nwhen she developed medical issues that affected her ability to work. Her income was \ndrastically reduced when she went on disability, resulting in her inability to pay her bills. \nAs a consequence, she resorted to using credit cards and accumulated more delinquent \ndebts. Applicant did not produce documentary proof to support her statements that she \npaid certain debts. Until she is in a better position to resolve her delinquent debts, it is \ntoo early to conclude that her finances are not a security concern. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1. c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.j-1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 19, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  FORM Item 5. \n \nJuly 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn January 2, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 3, 2009, was provided to \nhim by letter dated February 4, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on February 9, \n2009. He was afforded a period of 30 days to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He failed to submit any materials, comments, or \nobjections in response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2009. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nIn the FORM, the government moved to amend the SOR by adding SOR \u00b6 1.r: \n\u201cYou are indebted to CRDTONEBNK in the approximate amount of $523 on an account \nthat was charged off. As of December 9, 2008, this debt had not been paid.\u201d  \n \nI granted the amendment without objection. The amendment was supported by \nthe evidence provided and Applicant was provided the required notice.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, 1.h \nthrough 1.k, and 1.n through 1.q. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.r. \nConcerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g, Applicant answered the SOR allegation stating \n\u201cunknown,\u201d and I considered both denied. He did not answer the additional allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 1.r, and I considered it denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old production control dispatcher working for a defense \ncontractor.3 He graduated from high school and attended college from July 2006 to \nOctober 2006. Applicant indicated he was issued a confidential security clearance \nbetween 1983 and 1991. He provided no information about the agency or employer that \ngranted this confidential security clearance. There is no evidence that he ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information.  \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 5 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant has never been married and has no children. Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance application shows he has been employed from April 2001 to the present. \nFrom April 2001 to April 2004, he worked for six different employers, most of them for \nshort periods of time. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, \nfrom April 2004, to the present. Initially, he worked as an \u201cexpeditor,\u201d and since April \n2008, he has worked as a production control dispatcher.  \n \nIn his 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he had debts over \n180 days delinquent during the last seven years and that, at the time he submitted his \nsecurity clearance application, he also had debts over 90 days delinquent. He \nspecifically disclosed having delinquent accounts with the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.m (a note for a repossessed car), and 1.r. (a credit card). \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent and/or charged-off accounts, totaling \napproximately $19,600, which were listed in the two credit reports.4 Many of the debts \nhave been delinquent for a number of years, and can be considered small debts as they \nare for less than $1,000. Applicant provided no explanation about the debts he admitted \nor denied. He failed to explain how he acquired the alleged debts, why they became \ndelinquent, what he has done to resolve his delinquent and/or charged off debts, and \nwhat he plans to do to avoid similar financial problems in the future.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s November 2008 personal financial statement (PFS) shows a monthly \nnet remainder of $55. His indicated a monthly income of $1,960; monthly expenses of \n$1,500; and two monthly payments totaling $405 (for a car note and a student loan \npayment). He indicated no payments being made to resolve any of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n \n4  An applicant\u2019s credit report showing the delinquent debts alleged in an SOR is sufficient to \nestablish the government\u2019s prima facie case. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2003). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has accumulated 17 delinquent and/or charged-off accounts totaling \napproximately $19,600, many of which have been outstanding for a number of years \nand involve small debts of less than $1,000. He presented no evidence of efforts to pay \nor resolve his financial obligations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. His financial problems are ongoing and his evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence to establish circumstances beyond his control \ncontributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., period of unemployment and/or \nbusiness downturn. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of efforts to contact creditors, or to resolve his \ndebts by entering into settlement agreements or payment plans with any creditors. I \nnote that in his security clearance application, he claimed that two debts were pending \nsettlement. However, Applicant presented no evidence to corroborate his claim. \nApplicant has been consistently employed since April 2001. He presented no evidence \nof efforts to resolve any of his delinquent debts from 2001 to the day he received the \nFORM. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there are no clear indications that his \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. His inability to pay even relatively \nsmall debts shows he is financially overextended. He also failed to present any \nevidence that he received financial counseling or that his financial problems are not \nlikely to recur. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the \nfacts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for his five \nyears working for a government contractor. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation, or that he ever compromised classified information. These factors show some \nresponsibility and mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. The sparse record evidence fails to convince me \nof Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.r: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn February 6 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 4, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 15, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on May 4, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n(AE) A and B. The record was held open until May 18, 2009, to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents. A post-hearing request was made by Applicant to extend \nthe time to submit additional documents to May 20, 2009. Department Counsel did not \nobject (Hearing Exhibit I) and the record remained opened until the requested date. \nApplicant submitted additional documents that were marked as AE C through E. \nDepartment Counsel did not object and they were admitted. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 11, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since March \n2008. He retired from the Air Force in 2005, in the grade of E-6, after 20 years of \nservice. He has been married since 1996 and has one child from the marriage and three \nchildren from a previous marriage. Three of the children currently live at home. \nApplicant was unemployed from January 2008 to March 2008, until he was hired by his \npresent employer.1 \n \nUpon retiring from the military Applicant\u2019s income decreased significantly. He had \ndifficulty getting a job that paid enough to compensate his prior military income. He \nexpected that he would be earning more than what he was. Applicant was earning \napproximately $62,000 a year while in the military. When he retired he earned an hourly \nwage of $13.25 or approximately $25,000 annually. His retirement pay was \napproximately $27,000 annually. Applicant worked extra hours to earn more and meet \nhis expenses, but still could not pay his bills. At some point his monthly mortgage \npayment increased due to his failure to make the payments on time. He began falling \nbehind in his financial obligations. He got behind in his mortgage payments. He \nattempted to catch up with the payments and paid a lump sum to do so, but the \nmortgage company then requested another large lump sum, which again was paid. \nApplicant was trying to prevent his home from foreclosure. The two large lump sum \npayments caused a shortage of money to pay his other bills. He refinanced his home to \nobtain a lower interest rate on the mortgage. He took out a second mortgage and \nborrowed against the equity of his home. Applicant kept slipping back into being unable \nto make his mortgage payments. Both he and his wife were working at the time. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has since been unemployed since October 2008, due to a medical \ncondition. Due to his concern about losing his house Applicant filed for bankruptcy \nunder Chapter 13 to prevent foreclosure in February 2009.2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s payment plan under his bankruptcy requires he pay $632.41 a month \nfor five years. At the time of his hearing he had made three payments on the plan. \n \n1 Tr. 27-32, 84. \n \n2 Tr. 26-70. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nIncluded in the plan are the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b (home mortgage), 1.c (medical, \n$84), 1.d (medical, $196), 1.e (medical, $333), 1.f (medical $147), 1.g (medical, $75), \n1.h (phone, $376) and 1.i (recreational vehicle, $2,678).3 Applicant testified he was \nunaware of the medical debts and the phone bill until he received the SOR. He did not \nget a bill from the creditors at the time or from a collection agency for these debts. He \nbelieved his insurance covered the medical bills. He had shut off his land line phone two \nyears ago and believes this bill was for that service. All of Applicant\u2019s debts in the SOR \nare being paid through his bankruptcy plan.4  \n \n \nApplicant participated in the on-line financial counseling required when filing for \nbankruptcy. He anticipates having extra expendable income when the lease on a car he \nhas expires and he returns the car. His son is graduating from high school this year and \nentering the military and will no longer be living at home. Applicant does not have any \ncredit cards and has no other delinquent debts. He and his wife started a budget several \nmonths ago and are saving $325 a month and have $500 left after paying their \nexpenses. He anticipates a refund of approximately $1,100 from his 2008 tax returns. \nApplicant earns more at his current job and is able to meet his financial obligations. He \nis committed to repaying his debts and living within his means.5  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor provided a character letter for him. He believes Applicant \nto be an extremely hard worker, who values the principles of ethical decisions. Applicant \nis extremely dedicated to his country and family. He is considered responsible, \ndedicated and a caring individual. A fellow worker considers Applicant conscientious \nand courteous. He is a person who pursues his work responsibilities with diligence and \ncare.6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n \n3 Tr. 92-96; GE 3 and 4; AE D and E. SOR \u00b6 1.i is for a recreational vehicle that was purchased in \nJune 2004, prior to Applicant\u2019s retirement from the military. The vehicle was voluntarily repossessed in \nApril 2008, after Applicant retired and had financial difficulties. The amount listed is the deficiency after \nthe vehicle was sold.  \n \n4 Tr. 57-60, 70-79, 96-99. \n \n5 Tr. 79-92. \n \n6 AE A and B. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant had delinquent debts that he was unable to pay for a period time. He \ncontinues to owe the debts and is paying them through a bankruptcy plan. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because his delinquent debts are not completely \nsatisfied and are still being paid through his bankruptcy plan. However, the \ncircumstances that caused Applicant\u2019s difficulty in paying his bills are unlikely to recur. \nApplicant experienced a significant decrease in his income when he retired from the \nmilitary. He had difficulty finding a job that compensated for the loss of his income, even \nafter receiving his retirement pay. He was unemployed for a short period of time. These \nfactors contributed to his financial inability to pay all of his bills. Applicant attempted to \nprevent the foreclosure of his home by filing for bankruptcy. All of his debts are included \nin his repayment plan. He now has a job that pays more and has a budget. He has not \nincurred additional delinquent debt. Applicant is committed to living within his means. I \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfind the conditions that affected Applicant\u2019s finances were beyond his control. He has \nacted responsibly in putting together a plan to repay his creditors and has made \nconsistent payments toward that plan. I find all of the above mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military for \ntwenty years. He had difficulty finding a job that paid well enough to supplement his \nretirement income and got behind in paying his bills. To prevent losing his house he \nfiled for bankruptcy and is paying his debts through a court approved plan. Applicant is \ncommitted to resolving all of his debts and living debt free. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant successfully mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 20, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 8, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n\nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s assertions rely on evidence not presented to the Judge at the hearing, the\n1\nBoard cannot consider that new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have found in his favor because he has held a security\nclearance without incident since the 1960s, his financial problems were due to unemployment and\nsubtle age discrimination, and he did not seek bankruptcy as a resolution for his unpaid debts.1\nThese arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to\nlaw.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings: Applicant was unemployed or\nunderemployed from 2001 until 2006, a circumstance which caused his current financial difficulties.\nHe has about $100,000 equity in his house, and has access to about $80,000 in cash and retirement\naccounts.  Most recently, he and his spouse are engaged in a federally sponsored loan modification\nprocess and have retained professional services to expedite the process.  Applicant admits to owing\nabout $72,642 in past due debts to thirteen different creditors.  \u201cThe Applicant is unsure of the origin\nof many of these debts, and has done nothing, apart from looking at a loan modification program,\nto address his debts.\u201d  Decision at 2.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  The\nJudge reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  In particular, the Judge noted that although Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems had been due to circumstances beyond his control: \u201cApplicant had done little to address\nthe alleged past due debts.  They are still outstanding despite his considerable net worth, and he has\nonly started to address them th[r]ough a loan modification program, with unclear results, if any.\u201d\nDecision at 4.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

On May 20, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2009.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing on July 6, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on July 9, 2009, and I received the\ncase assignment on July 31, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 5,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 17, 2009.  The\n\nThe debts found in Subparagraph 1.a. and 1.b. are to the same creditor.  The debts found in Subparagraphs 1.e. and\n1\n1.j. are to another creditor, and the debts found in Subparagraphs 1.o.~1.q. are yet to another creditor.\n2\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 9, which were received by way of\nstipulation.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (TR) on September 25, 2009.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s request to keep the\nrecord open until October 15, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On October 8th and\n14th, 2009, he submitted, through Department Counsel, Exhibits (AppXs) A and B,\nwithout objection.  The record closed on October 19, 2009, on receipt of AppXs from\nDepartment Counsel.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations of\nthe SOR, without explanations.\nThe Applicant was unemployed or underemployed from 2001 until 2006, when he\nobtained his present employment (TR at page 15 line 21 to page 16 line 6).  This\ncaused the Applicant\u2019s current financial difficulties (TR at page 17 line 20 to page 18 line\n8, and at page 24 line 12 to page 28 line 14).

Most recently, he and his spouse \u201care\nengaged in a Federally sponsored Loan Modification process and have retained\nProfessional services to expedite the process\u201d (AppX A at page 1).\n1.a.~1.r.  The Applicant admittedly owes about $72,642 in past due debts to 13\ndifferent creditors (TR at page 22 line 7 to page 24 line 11, and GX 4 and 5).   The\n1\nApplicant is unsure of the origin of many of these debts, and has done nothing, apart\nfrom looking at a loan modification program, to address his debts (Id, and TR at page 20\nline 18 to page 21 line 7).  Of particular note is the fact that the last four debts alleged in\nSubparagraphs 1.o.~1.r. of the SOR total only about $430, yet the Applicant has done\nnothing of any substance to address them.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to\n\n3\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\n\n4\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant incurred his past due\nindebtedness during an extended period of unemployment or underemployment.\nThe Mitigating Condition found in Subparagraph 20(b) is applicable where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment . . .).@  However, Subparagraph 20(d) under the\nMitigating Conditions is not applicable, as it applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.@  Here, the Applicant has done little to address the alleged past due debts.  They\nare still outstanding despite his considerable net worth, and he has only started to\naddress them though a loan modification program, with unclear results, if any.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Here, he has the unqualified support of his\nSupervisor, and of his Team Lead (TR at page 22 line 14 to page 25 line 12, and AppX\nB).  However, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.~1.r.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esq., Stephanie N. Mendez, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 2, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 25, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Robert J. Tuidor denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider all of\nthe record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law in that he failed properly to apply the Guideline H mitigating conditions.  For the reasons set\nforth below, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant used marijuana during two periods of his life: from 1976 to\n1983 and again from 1998 to 2007.  The latter use occurred while Applicant held a security\nclearance.  Additionally, in 2007, another government agency denied Applicant access to Sensitive\nCompartmented Information (SCI) due to his prior drug use.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider numerous documents, including character\nletters and a psychological evaluation, which he submitted in his own behalf.  However, the Judge\nadmitted these documents into evidence (Tr. at 12).  Furthermore, he summarized them in his\nFindings of Fact and discussed them in the Analysis portion of the Decision, in which he concluded\nthat Applicant had mitigated two of the four Guideline E allegations.  Applicant has failed to rebut\nthe presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at\n3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Although\nApplicant disagrees with the weight which the Judge assigned to this evidence, the record does not\nsupport a conclusion that he weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009); ISCR Case No.\n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIt is well settled that (1) there is no presumption of error below, (2) where the Judge entered\nformal findings against Applicant under a Guideline and Applicant failed to raise a challenge to the\nfindings and conclusions under that Guideline, the findings and conclusions need not be reviewed,\nand (3) an adverse conclusion under a single guideline is sufficient for an adverse decision.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 00-0051 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2001); ISCR Case. No. 02-04005 at 3, fn. 1 (App.\nBd. Dec. 31, 2003); ISCR Case No. 02-28502 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2004) and ISCR Case No. 97-\n0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997).  In the case presently under review, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief\nfocuses on the Guideline H security concerns.  Department Counsel, in his reply brief, correctly\nobserves: \u201cIt is important to note that Applicant has not challenged on appeal, either explicitly or\nimplicitly, the Administrative Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions under Guideline E and the whole-person\nconcept . . . The failure to do so constitutes a waiver of any possible issues on these matters on\nappeal.\u201d  Department Counsel Reply Brief at 7, n. 25.\n \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his application of the Guideline H mitigating\nconditions.  The Judge extended some favorable consideration to Applicant\u2019s having submitted a\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.26(b): \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as . . . a signed\n1\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation[.]\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.26(d): \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited\n2\nto rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\u201d  \nThe report does not relate a course of treatment for substance abuse or dependency.  Rather, it is a letter from\n3\na psychiatrist describing his interviews with Applicant, tests he performed, etc.  In the concluding paragraph, the\npsychiatrist stated that Applicant \u201cis a fine human being, who is dedicated to his work, ethic, principle, and his family.\u201d\nHe stated that Applicant regrets his mistakes and is willing to submit to further testing if necessary.  Insofar as the report\ncontained no diagnosis of an illness, the Judge did not err in observing that it lacked a prognosis.  See Cambridge\nInternational Dictionary of English, definition of \u201cprognosis\u201d: \u201c[D]octor\u2019s judgment of the likely or expected\ndevelopment of a disease[.]\u201d    \n3\nsigned statement of intent not to use drugs in the future.   However, he noted other evidence that was\n1\nless favorable.  This includes evidence that Applicant returned to marijuana use in 1998 after having\nabstained for many years and that his second period of use occurred while he held a security\nclearance.  Applicant contends that the Judge erred in his treatment of the psychological report,\ninsofar as the Judge stated that the report did not contain a favorable prognosis regarding future drug\nuse.  Applicant argues that the report did indeed contain such a prognosis and that it should have\nbeen considered in light of Guideline H Mitigating Condition 26(b).   We have examined this report\n2\nand find no error with the manner in which the Judge treated it.   Viewed in light of the record as a\n3\nwhole, the Judge\u2019s analysis of the Guideline H mitigating conditions was not in error.\n In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision\nis sustainable under the standard set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned; Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan          \nMichael Y.

He has held a secret security clearance since March 1983 until it was suspended as a result of these proceedings.3 The pending inquiry stems from Applicant seeking to upgrade his security clearance to top secret.

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non July 22, 2009. On August 13, 2009, the case was assigned to me. On September 4, \n2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for October 1, 2009. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through Q, which \nwere received without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October \n9, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old systems engineering manager, who has been \nemployed by a defense contractor since January 1983. He has held a secret security \nclearance since March 1983 until it was suspended as a result of these proceedings.3 \nThe pending inquiry stems from Applicant seeking to upgrade his security clearance to \ntop secret. Maintaining a security clearance is a condition of Applicant\u2019s continued \nemployment. Tr. 22-23, 54-56, GE 1, GE 2. Applicant has never had a security violation. \nHe does not have a police record. Tr. 30, GE 1, GE 2. \n \n \nApplicant was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in \nMay 1980. He married in August 1982, and has two daughters, ages 21 and 18. Tr. 24, \n56, GE 1, GE 2.  \n \nDrug Involvement   \n \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 1976 and 1983 (ages \n18 to 25), and from 1998 to 2007 (ages 30 to 49). Tr. 26. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) He stated he \nused marijuana in the company of two individuals, a life-long friend (old friend), and a \nrelatively recent acquaintance (new friend). He \u201cgrew up\u201d with the old friend and he met \nthe new friend more recently through his wife and children. Applicant and his old friend \nwould occasionally go ocean fishing and smoke marijuana while fishing. Applicant\u2019s new \n \n2 Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n3 A review of the case file reflects the Defense Security Service (DSS) suspended Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance on February 9, 2009. GE 4. \n\n \n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfriend is a jeweler, whom he described as \u201ca very artistic type person.\u201d Applicant \ntypically would have a \u201chit\u201d of marijuana when he was at his new friend\u2019s house with his \nwife. Applicant and his new friend smoked marijuana when they were \u201cbasically outside\u201d \nand their spouses were inside. Applicant last smoked marijuana with his new friend on \nJanuary 1, 2007. He stated that he no longer smokes marijuana with his old or new \nfriends. Tr. 27-28.  \n \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant admitted attending numerous briefings over \nthe years concerning prohibitions against use of illegal drugs, and he acknowledged \ndrug use was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. Tr. 34-35. Applicant \ntestified that he had difficulty recalling the exact number of times he used marijuana with \nhis old and new friends. Although Applicant manifested genuine uncertainty about past \nmarijuana use, I am satisfied that he did use marijuana with varying frequency during \nthis timeframes alleged while holding a security clearance. Tr. 36-47. The apparent \ncatalyst that led up to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use again in 1998 after a five-year break \nwas the environment of being on his old friend\u2019s fishing boat. Tr. 45. \n \nOn July 8, 2009, Applicant provided a statement in accordance with AG \u00b6 26(b) \nto demonstrate his intent not to abuse illegal drugs in the future. He provided \u201ca signed \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of [his] clearance for any violation\u201d Tr. 29, \nAE M.  \n \nWhen queried why anyone would believe him about no longer using drugs, \nApplicant responded: \n \nWell, I realize I made a mistake. I was basically in shellshock when I, I \nrealized, when I was applying for the SCI clearance, the great mistake I \nmade at that time. My, and, so basically, mentally, I wrote that Statement \nof Intent back at that time. And I\u2019m basically, have always been a very \ntrustworthy person. I realized I\u2019ve erred. And when I have my evaluation \nwith my psychiatrist, I came out feeling responsible for the actions that I\u2019ve \ntaken. I messed up and just would like the, you know, Court to understand \nthat. I dedicated, you know, a good 25 years of my life to, you know, \ndefending this country and I\u2019d like to continue that. Tr. 30. \n \nApplicant testified that he does not condone drug use. Tr. 30. Applicant had filled \nout an application to renew his security clearance in 2002, and was granted a security \nclearance in June 2002. As noted supra, Applicant has held a security clearance since \n1983, and used marijuana after being granted a security clearance. Tr. 46-47, GE 5. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86) for \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) with another government agency. On his \nSF-86, he listed illegal drug use of \u201cpot\u201d a \u201ccouple\u201d of times between January 1, 2006 \n\n \n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nand January 1, 2007 while holding a sensitive position. On May 31, 2007, he was \ninterviewed by an adjudicator and stated that within the past 12 months, he smoked \nmarijuana two to three times. When asked how many times he used marijuana in the \npast seven years, Applicant explained that his old friend went boating four times a \nsummer. He advised that he and his old friend would \u201cget high\u201d by smoking a marijuana \ncigarette on numerous occasions. When asked if 28 times was an accurate number of \nuses, Applicant estimated that he \u201cgot high\u201d about one-half of those times. He ultimately \nagreed to using marijuana 14 times in the past seven years. When given the opportunity \nto review his answers, Applicant mentioned another marijuana use around February \n2006. He agreed that he may have used marijuana three to four times in 2006 instead \nof the two to three times as previously stated. On August 14, 2007, that government \nagency denied Applicant SCI access. Tr. 48-50, 52, GE 4. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \n \n \nIn the SOR, Applicant was cited for submitting false or incomplete information \nregarding past drug use on his April 2002 SF-86 and on his March 2007 SF-86. In \nparticular, Applicant listed past marijuana use on his March 2007 SF-86 as \u201ca couple of \ntimes from about January 2006 to January 2007,\u201d whereas his use was from at least \n2001 to January 2007. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. \u2013 2.c.) Applicant acknowledged the information \nsubmitted on those SF-86s is incorrect, but added it was not his intent to deliberately \nmislead the government. He explained: \n \nI, I thought about trying to answer it. I know I did it in the past. I was not \ntrying to make myself out to be a heavy drug user, which I am not, since in \nall cases when I did do it, it was merely taking one or two puffs. And it\u2019s \nvery hard to recall when, when you\u2019re doing these, what transpired, \nlooking back into the past. During some of these years in the past, it\u2019s \u2013 I \nhave been under a lot of stress at work because my company, we went \nthrough a merger with our competitor. And since we merged with our \ncompetitor, they\u2019ve constantly been trying to kill us and our product. So \nI\u2019ve had some very stressful times at work because I\u2019m passionate about \nwhat we do, the product we make. That\u2019s all my witnesses that were here, \ntoday. And what I find is when you sit with an interrogator, they, they tend \nto do their job well and bring out, they get you to go back in memory and \ngo through that. Tr. 51. \n \n \nAs noted supra, Applicant has had difficulty recalling with any degree of certainty \ndetails regarding his past marijuana use. Having had the chance to observe him, I noted \nthis difficulty. This is somewhat understandable given the fact his marijuana uses \ncovered two significant periods of time from 1976 to 1883 and from 1998 to 2007. What \nis clear and as noted supra, I do believe that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency during these time periods. Applicant was forthcoming when questioned about \npast drug use such as when he was applying for SCI access with another government \nagency in May 2007 and when interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator in May 2008. GE 4, GE 5. \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nThree witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, a co-worker engineer, his \noperations manager, and his facility security officer. All three witnesses are long-term \ncompany employees and have held security clearances for many years. The witnesses \nsee Applicant on a daily basis. They described Applicant as \u201cone of the most dedicated \nemployees,\u201d \u201cone of the[ir] best employees,\u201d \u201cdemonstrate[s] a professional attitude,\u201d \nand is \u201cvery trustworthy.\u201d All of the witnesses support reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. Tr. 13-24. \n \nApplicant submitted at least ten favorable character reference letters from a \ncross section of individuals to include the three witnesses who testified on his behalf, his \n\u201cold (childhood) friend,\u201d former co-workers, present co-workers, father-in-law, close \nfamily friends, and supervisory personnel. The collective sense of these letters \ndescribes Applicant in a most favorable way. They used adjectives to describe Applicant \nsuch as \u201cupfront and honest,\u201d \u201creliable and totally trustworthy,\u201d \u201cdirect and \nstraightforward,\u201d \u201cknowledgeable and passionate [for] the company\u2019s product,\u201d \n\u201cdemonstrated leadership qualities,\u201d \u201cunwavering professionalism,\u201d \u201ccompassion and \nhonest,\u201d \u201cvery hard working,\u201d \u201cgifted and talented engineer, and \u201cone of the most \ndedicated staff members . . . in this business.\u201d His supervisory personnel described the \nimportance of Applicant\u2019s work in support of national defense. All references fully \nsupport Applicant in retaining his security clearance. AE - G, AE I - L. \n \nApplicant provided a four-page biography that described his childhood, family life, \neducation, work interests, and professional accomplishments. AE A. He submitted three \nyears of employee evaluations covering the periods January 2006 to December 2008, \nwhich reflect above average performance. AE H. His employer gave him monetary \nawards in recognition of his performance on four occasions in May 2003, December \n2007, June 2009, and August 2009. AE P. He submitted two separate negative drug \ntests dated August 4, 2009 and August 18, 2009. AE N, AE O. Lastly, Applicant \nprovided a Psychosocial Evaluation from a Board Certified Psychiatrist dated \nSeptember 28, 2009. The psychiatrist provided a very favorable assessment of \nApplicant and described him as \u201ca fine human being, who is dedicated to his work, \nethic, principle and his family.\u201d He noted Applicant acknowledged his mistakes and had \nno reason to doubt his honesty and sincerity.\u201d Although the report is clearly favorable \nand discusses Applicant\u2019s many fine qualities, it does not provide a formal prognosis. \nAE Q. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \n\n \n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines H (drug involvement) and E (personal conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug-involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use discussed supra \ntriggers two drug-involvement disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this particular case. AG \u00b6 25(a), indicates, \u201cany \ndrug abuse,\u201d4 and AG \u00b6 25(c) states, \u201cillegal drug possession,\u201d could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 \nare not applicable. These disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used and \npossessed marijuana.5 He disclosed his drug abuse in his August 2007 SF-86, his \ninterview with another government agency\u2019s adjudicators in April and May 2007, to an \nOPM investigator in May 2008, responses to DOHA interrogatories, and at his hearing. \nHe possessed marijuana before he used this substance.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n \n4AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n5AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substances. See Sch. I(c)(9). See also Gonzales v. \nRaish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, \n449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. 2006). \n\n \n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or do not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows \u201ca significant \nperiod of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative \njudge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d6 \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. The Appeal Board addressed the recency \nof drug use, stating:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \n\n \n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 1976 to 1983, a period of \nseven years during the ages of 18 to 25, and resumed using marijuana with varying \nfrequency from 1998 to January 2007, a period of nine years during the ages of 40 to \n49. I find it very troubling that Applicant resumed marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance (emphasis added) and knowing it was in violation of DOD policy. During \nApplicant\u2019s second period of marijuana use, he was a mature family man, and a well \nregarded employee. Applicant did not have the fortitude or common sense to resist the \ntemptations to repeatedly use marijuana knowing the potential adverse consequences.  \n \nI am not convinced a sufficient amount of time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last \ndrug use in January 2007, taking into account the two lengthy periods of time he used \nmarijuana, and the fact that he returned to using marijuana after a five-year break. At \nage 51, he claims to recognize the adverse impact of his lengthy and varying marijuana \nuse. These recent assurances are not enough to overcome Applicant\u2019s repeated breach \nof trust over time. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply to his drug-related offenses.7    \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. Applicant claims to have disassociated or distanced himself \nfrom his drug-using associates and contacts, although not enough to preclude his old \nfriend from submitting a character letter on his behalf. AE C. He has abstained from \ndrug abuse for approximately three years; however, as noted supra, Applicant\u2019s three-\nyear abstinence is relatively short when contrasted with his drug use history. He did \nreturn to using drugs after five years of leading a drug-free life. Applicant provided \u201ca \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 26(b) partially apples.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. Marijuana \nwas never prescribed for him. He did not satisfactorily complete a prescribed drug \ntreatment program. Moreover, he cannot receive full credit because he did not provide \n\u201ca favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional, including rehabilitation \nand aftercare requirements.\u201d  \n \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n7In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n\n \n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in January 2007, about three years \nago. However, given his history of returning to marijuana use for nine years while \nholding a security clearance after a five-year break does not provide me with the \nassurances required when evaluating security clearance suitability. In reaching this \nconclusion, I have considered the lengthy periods Applicant has used marijuana over his \nlifetime, his age, education, experience, family situation, and the fact he used marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance or alternatively stated while in a position of trust and \nresponsibility.8 Although Applicant has not used marijuana in approximately three years, \nI am not convinced that he has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record to \nmitigate past drug involvement.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process \nthe adjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n \n8The Appeal Board has reversed decisions granting a clearance because the administrative judge \nconsidered individual acts of misconduct one-by-one and determined the isolated acts were mitigated. \nISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. \n17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006). In ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 \n(App. Bd. June 27, 2008), the Appeal Board explained it is the overall conduct that determines whether a \nclearance should be granted stating: \n \nThe Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category \nof incidents separately, the Judge failed to consider the significance of the \u201cevidence as a \nwhole\u201d and Applicant's pattern of conduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, \n866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). Under the whole person concept, a \nJudge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge\u2019s \npiecemeal analysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of \u00b6 \nE2.2 of the Directive. \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006), see Whole Person Concept at pages \n14-15, infra.  \n \n\n \n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and  \n \n(d)(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.9 \n \nIn August 2007 Applicant was denied SCI access by another government agency \ndue to his past drug involvement. AG \u00b6 16 describes four conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying with respect to his denial of SCI access in \nthis case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n9The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n. . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; and \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nIn April 2002 and March 2007, Applicant provided SF-86s that made inquiries \nabout past drug use. Applicant denied and understated his past drug use, respectively. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(d)(3) apply because he provided at least one SF-86 with \nfalse information about his marijuana use.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s application for SCI access with another government agency was \ndenied because of his past marijuana use. He used marijuana while holding a DOD \nsecurity clearance, which violated the conditions of his access. He associated with \nindividuals who used marijuana. This behavior exposed Applicant to potential \nexploitation. It showed poor judgment and an inability to follow rules. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) \nthrough 16 (f) apply. Further review is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n\n \n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nApplicant stated it was not his intent to deliberately falsify his security clearance \napplications. He was forthcoming when queried by two different investigators, and \nduring his testimony. As noted supra, Applicant had difficulty in recalling the number of \nhis marijuana uses over the years. When questioned, he admitted past use, but had \ndifficulty recalling dates, the number of times, and when his use resumed after a \nminimum five-year break. His answers minimizing his past marijuana use were sufficient \nenough to put the government on notice that he had used marijuana in the past. \nApplicant acknowledged his answers were incorrect, but added that there was no intent \non his part to deliberately falsify his SF-86s. That response may be sufficient when \nresponding to questions about past drug use on his April 2002 SF-86, given the fact \nthere was a minimum five-year gap between his two periods of marijuana use and the \nuncertainty about the start time of his second period of marijuana use. However, that \nresponse is not sufficient when explaining the minimized answer he gave on his March \n2007 SF-86 describing his past drug use. As noted supra, after another government \nagency adjudicator questioned him in May 2007, Applicant acknowledged using \nmarijuana 14 times in the past seven years.10 \n \nA statement is false when it is made deliberately. An omission of relevant and \nmaterial information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, \ninadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the \ninformation did not need to be reported. He was candid and forthright at his hearing \nabout his past marijuana use. In evaluating his testimony, I note his memory has faded \nover time. However, given Applicant\u2019s subsequent admitted extensive marijuana use \nduring various inquiries, I do not find it plausible that that he honestly and reasonably \nbelieved the answer he provided when completing his March 2007 SF-86 to be truthful. \nAccordingly, I find Applicant purposely understated his past marijuana use when \ncompleting his March 2007 SF-86. \n \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence supports the notion that he is an honest person. \nThe testimony of his character witnesses and authors of his character reference letters \n \n10 See pages 3-4, supra. \n\n \n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nalso believe Applicant is an honest person. I conclude Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification of \nhis April 2002 SF-86 is mitigated, however, I conclude his alleged falsification of his \nMarch 2007 SF-86 is not mitigated. Although he provided incorrect information on his \nApril 2002 SF-86, AG \u00b6 17(f) applies. The falsification allegations are not substantiated. \nI am satisfied he did not deliberately and intentionally fail to disclose his past marijuana \nuse with intent to deceive with respect the SOR \u00b6 1.c.11  \n \nThe mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e), \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior\u201d and \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d partially apply to mitigate \nhis marijuana use and his falsification of SF-86s. Security officials and his employer are \nwell aware of Applicant\u2019s problems. Applicant has taken the positive step of disclosure, \neliminating any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress with respect to this \nmisconduct. I do not believe Applicant would compromise national security to avoid \npublic disclosure of these problems.  \n \nHis denial of SCI access by another government agency in August 2007 due to \ndrug involvement is another matter. His marijuana use and association with individuals \nwho used marijuana while holding a security clearance in clear violation of DOD policy, \nwhich had the potential to serve as a basis for exploitation, support a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) through 16(g) apply.  \n \nApplicant deserves substantial credit in the whole person analysis for admitting \nhis marijuana use when interviewed by an adjudicator from another government agency \nin May 2007, and by an OPM investigator in May 2008. He re-admitted his marijuana \nuse at his hearing. I found Applicant\u2019s admissions about his marijuana use at his \nhearing to be credible. However, the personal conduct concerns pertaining to \nApplicant\u2019s denial of SCI access by another government agency in August 2007 cannot \nbe mitigated at this time.  \n \n \n \n \n11The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral change; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nhas worked for his employer for 27 years. His supervisors, co-workers, and \nperformance evaluations indicate he has made significant work-related contributions to \nthe national defense industry throughout the years. All those who testified on his behalf \nand submitted character reference letters on his behalf, state he is a decent individual, \nwho is a dedicated family man. He showed he had the ability to abstain from illegal drug \nuse for at least a five-year period. During background investigations and at his hearing, \nhe admitted his history of illegal drug use. He knows the consequences of drug abuse. \nThere is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time. Applicant used marijuana over two separate cycles -- 1976 to 1983 and 1998 \nto 2007. His decisions to possess and use marijuana (each time he used marijuana he \nmade a separate decision about whether to violate the law) were knowledgeable, \nvoluntary, and intentional. This is more than a brief youthful experimental use of \nmarijuana. His decision to again using marijuana is further exacerbated given his age, \nexperience, and employment in the defense industry while holding a security clearance. \nHe was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. These offenses show \na serious lack of judgment and a failure to abide by the law. Such judgment lapses are \nmaterial in the context of security requirements. His misconduct raises a serious \nsecurity concern, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \n\n \n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug involvement and personal conduct \nwith regard to being denied SCI access due to drug involvement by another government \nagency in 2007. For reasons discussed supra, personal conduct concerns regarding \nfalsification are mitigated.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. to 2.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance at this time.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n \n12See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Oportus, Esq.\nJuly 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing,\n(e-QIP) on May 8, 2008.  On March 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline H for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 16, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on May 12, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 2,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for June 23, 2009.  The Government offered three\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant called one witness, and offered fourteen exhibits, referred to\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through N and testified on his own behalf.  The transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) was received on June 30, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 46 years old and married with one child.  He has a Master\u2019s\nDegree of Science in Information and Telecommunication Systems.  He is employed by\na defense contractor as a Senior Computer Consultant, and is applying for a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant obtained his masters degree from a prestigious university.  He has\nbeen working for his current employer since November 2006.  However, since 2002, he\nhas worked on a government contract.  Applicant testified that he used marijuana with\nvarying frequency, at least ten times a year, from 1980 through 2009.  On two\noccasions during this period, on August 14, 1982, and in November 1984, the Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana.  On both occasions, he was\nfound guilty and sentenced to pay a fine and court costs.  (Government Exhibit 2).  He\nsuccessfully completed the sentence in both cases.       \nAt various times while using marijuana, he purchased it for his own use.  He\ntestified that he has never grown, cultivated or sold marijuana.  (Tr. P. 45).  He\nexplained that he last used marijuana in February 2009 during the Super Bowl game.\n(Tr. pp. 46-47).  Since then he has taken three separate drug tests that have all come\nback negative for drugs, including marijuana.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits J, K and M).  He has\nalso signed a notarized statement of intent dated June 2, 2009, indicating that if he were\nto ever use any illegal drugs in the future he agrees to the immediate revocation of his\nsecurity clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L, and Tr. p. 49).  The Applicant testified that he\nhas decided to stop using marijuana because his job and security clearance are more\nimportant than an occasional buzz.  (Tr. p. 49).  Two years ago, he moved from a\ncollege dominated beach community where illegal drug use was common and into a\nfamily oriented community.  He married a dentist who does not use illegal drugs.\nApplicant admits knowing that his use of marijuana was illegal, but that he was never\nnotified by his employer that it was against company policy.  (Tr. pp. 50-51).  Not\nwanting the effects of illegal drug use to be transferred to his offspring, during a four\nmonth period, from August 2007 through January 2008, when he and his wife were\ntrying to conceive a child, he stopped using marijuana.  At some point, he also stopped\nfor about a year or a year and a half but returned to using marijuana again.  (Tr. p. 73).\nHe does not believe that he is addicted and he has never sought out any medical\nattention for his drug use.              \nThe Applicant completed a security clearance application dated May 2008 and\nsubsequently, on October 1, 2008, underwent a personal subject interview by an\ninvestigator who inquired into his background to determine his eligibility for access to\nclassified information.  He knew at that time that the DoD was concerned about his\nhistory of illegal drug use.  Despite this, he used marijuana again in February 2009.    \n An individual who has worked with the Applicant since 2006 testified that he\ninteracts with the Applicant on a daily basis.  In his opinion, the Applicant is extremely\n\n3\nconscientious, and a  person of strong moral character who is hardworking, diligent, and\nhonest and recommended for a position of trust.  (Tr. pp. 28-37).     \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s manager, coworkers, brother-in-\nlaw, past school mate and professional colleagues and friends attest to his\ntrustworthiness and reliability.  He is considered intelligent, hardworking, conscientious\nand diligent in the performance of his job.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C, D, E and F).     \nApplicant\u2019s annual performance appraisals for 2007 and 2008 are favorable.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits H and I).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as:\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n\n4\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which the participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges.\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d                                              \n      \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\n\n5\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline H of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant\u2019s eighteen years history of marijuana use\nbegan in high school and continued through college and through his professional work\nhistory.  On average he used it at least ten times a year from 1980 through 2008.  His\nmost recent use of marijuana occurred in February 2009, just four months before the\nhearing.  He contends that he has now stopped using marijuana and has signed a\nstatement of intent indicating such.  However, under the particular circumstances of this\ncase, the statement of intent does not hold much weight given his long period of use\nand the fact that he used it as recently as February 2009.  He used marijuana knowing\nthat it was prohibited by law.  Common sense would dictate that it is also clearly\nprohibited by his employer and by the Department of Defense, even though he states\nthat he has never been notified of such.  The Applicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates poor\njudgment and untrustworthiness.  He is not currently eligible for a security clearance.  If\nhe can continue to remain drug free in the future, he may be eligible for a security\nclearance sometime in the future, but not now.       \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 22(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  Although Mitigation Condition\n26(b)(4), a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as, a signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation is applicable,\nit is not controlling in this case.  I find his past use of illegal drugs to be too recent and of\nserious security significance.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline\nH, Drug Involvement.    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 46 years old, mature,\neducated, intelligent, successful, well respected, and he has worked for a government\ncontractor since at least 2002.  He has made some very poor decisions by using\nmarijuana for over the past eighteen years and has only four months of abstinence.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth above, when\nviewed under all of the guidelines as a whole, support a whole person assessment of\npoor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard classified information.  \n\n6\nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against\nthe Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).      \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.                                                            \n                                                                 \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and elected to have his case decided\non the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s\nwritten case on June 25, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n1\nOctober 20, 2009\n\n2\n(FORM) on July 13, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Applicant did\nnot submit additional information. The case was assigned to me on October 9, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 28, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d of the SOR. He did not provide additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school, and received a technical certificate in 1981. He is married and has two\nchildren. His wife has debilitating arthritis that prevents her employment. He has worked\nfor his current employer since February 2008 (Item 4). \nApplicant has worked steadily for many years. He refers to his strong work ethic\nand states that as a result of growing up on a ranch in Montana, he knows the value of\nhard work. He has never gambled. He believes that the SOR allegations put him in the\nsame category as \u201cthieves and compulsive gamblers.\u201d He takes offense at the idea that\nhe is not reliable or trustworthy because he has delinquent debts.\nApplicant stated that jobs in his state were scarce and that wages were low. He\ntried to raise his family on his income. He provided food and shelter, but he did not have\nenough money for everything. He obtained credit cards but he claimed he did not spend\nfrivolously. He elaborated that he used the credit cards to buy propane gas, pay taxes\nand get groceries. He estimated that each year he seemed to be about $10,000 short.\nHe believed the use of the credit cards kept them from \u201cgoing under.\u201d Applicant\nmaintained that his wages never increased, but the debts mounted. He used the money\nfor his family and not for any personal \u201chigh living\u201d (Item 7).\nApplicant moved to another state in 2007 to find better work. He reported a\nperiod of unemployment from December 2007 until February 2008. His 43-acre farm in\nhis home state has been for sale for three years. Due to the economy and poor market,\nit has not sold. He intends to pay his delinquent debts when he sells the farm. \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts for a total amount of approximately\n$21,068 (Item 3). Applicant admits owing the delinquent debts. His credit reports\nconfirm the debts (Items 5 and 6).\nIn his 2009 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted that he has a\ngreat deal of credit card debt. He is also adamant that he and his family are not\nextravagant. They buy used cars and are honest and hardworking. He has equity in his\nhome and farm and will be able to pay his delinquent debts when there is a sale. He\nstated that he is making some payments on his debts, but most were turned over to\n\n3\ncollection agencies. He also acknowledged that he could not make an accurate list of\nhis debts right now. He is trying to avoid future use of credit. He did not produce any\nevidence to document any payments that he made to his creditors. He relied on his plan\nto pay all his delinquent debts with the future sale of his farm.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n4\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has a history of financial problems since 2006. He\naccumulated delinquent debts from use of credit cards. His credit reports confirm the\ndebts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant has\ndelinquent debt that has not been resolved. He did not submit any mitigating information\nin response to the FORM. There is no indication when Applicant\u2019s home and farm may\nsell. Applicant\u2019s plan to pay these debts in the future is not sufficient for mitigation. This\nmitigating condition does not apply in this case. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ I do not find this a factor\nfor consideration in this case. Applicant had low wages and a period of unemployment\nfor a few months. However, he has worked steadily for many years. He acknowledged\nthat his expenses and spending exceeded his income by about $10,000 each year.\n\n5\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not resolved any debts. He did not submit any\ndocumentation that he has made payments on any accounts in small amounts. There is\nnothing in the record concerning financial counseling. His efforts are not sufficient to\ncarry his burden in this case. I conclude these mitigating conditions do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has failed to provide any\nevidence that the debts are not his responsibility. He has not produced any\ndocumentation that he has made any payments even on small debts. His plan to sell his\nfarm and pay the debts in the future is not sufficient for mitigation. He has worked\nsteadily for many years. He admitted that he goes over his income each year by about\n$10,000. He has not met his burden in this case. \nApplicant has provided for his wife and family for many years. He worked hard\nand believed that he did not live in an extravagant manner. He believed in the work\nethic. He wanted to sell his farm and pay the debts, but due to the economy that has not\noccurred. He does have good intentions, but that is not sufficient.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\n \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",
