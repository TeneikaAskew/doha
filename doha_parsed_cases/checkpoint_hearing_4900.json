On June 2, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  The \nprevious adjudicative guidelines, effective until September 1, 2006, applied to that SOR.  \nThis case has taken three years to arrive at its current status, and the Procedural \nHistory section of this Decision sets forth that chronology.  The guideline at issue in \nthis part of the case is Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Because the amended SOR \ncontaining this guideline was issued on August 8, 2006, I apply the previous Guideline E \nto this case also. \n  \n \nThis part of the case occurred because the original administrative judge assigned \nthe case denied the Government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR to include two Guideline E \n \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 28, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nallegations.  The Government appealed the case to the DOHA Appeal Board, which \nupheld the favorable decision on the Guideline F allegations, but ordered the Guideline \nE allegations to be considered by another administrative judge.  Therefore, this case is \na remand by the Appeals Board.   On January 16, 2008, another administrative judge \nentered an Order granting the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend the SOR to add the \nGuideline E allegations.  Applicant was given 30 days from January 16th to answer the \namended SOR. (Item 9) \n \nApplicant=s receipt for the current SOR is dated February 9, 2008.  He answered \nthe SOR in writing on that date.  He denied the allegations and requested a hearing.  \nThen, on March 30, 2008, Applicant withdrew the hearing request, and instead, asked \nthat his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Items 10-12) \n \nOn May 13, 2008, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case.  \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant. \nHe was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on June 19, 2007.  Applicant filed \na response to the FORM on July 5, 2008. I received the case assignment on July 14, \n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural History \n \n1. SOR issued June 2, 2005. \n \n2. Applicant acknowledged receipt of SOR on June 9, 2005.  He filed his Answer \non June 24, 2005.  He requested a hearing. \n \n3. On May 5, 2006, and on May 11, 2006, the Department Counsel sent \nApplicant the Government\u2019s discovery package. \n \n4. On May 15, 2006, Applicant withdrew his hearing request and asked for a \ndetermination on the written record (FORM). (Item 6) \n \n5.  On August 8, 2006, the Government filed its initial FORM in this case.  \n \n \n6. In the FORM, the Government moved to amend the SOR to add Guideline E \nand two allegations under that guideline.  These amendments were based upon \ndocumentary evidence the Government had forwarded to the Applicant in \ndiscovery in May 2006.  \n \n \n7.  Applicant filed a Reply to the Government\u2019s Initial FORM on September 18, \n2006.  In his Reply, Applicant answered the new allegations the Government had \nmoved to add to the SOR.  He objected to the addition of the Guideline \nallegations.  The Government argued that Applicant had been made aware of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthese new security concerns for over a month and had the documents supporting \nthese new allegations for over four months. (Item 7) \n \n \n8. On October 31, 2006, the first administrative judge assigned to the case \nissued a decision wherein he denied the Government\u2019s Motion to Amend the \nSOR to include the Guideline E allegations. The administrative judge found for \nthe Applicant on the Guideline F allegations.  That decision is not included in this \nFORM and I have not read it elsewhere.  The 2005 SOR is Item 1 in this FORM. \n \n \n9. On August 30, 2007, the Appeal Board remanded the judge\u2019s decision to \nanother administrative judge On appeal the Government did not challenge the \nadministrative judge\u2019s favorable finding for Applicant under Guideline F and, thus, \nthat portion of the Judge\u2019s decision was affirmed. The Appeal Board remanded \nthe decision to:  (a) allow the Government to amend the SOR to add allegations \nunder Guideline E; (b) provide Applicant the opportunity to answer the new \nallegations and request a hearing on those new allegations, and (c) \nrecommended a second administrative judge be assigned to the case, because it \nappeared the first assigned administrative judge had already prejudged the \nGovernment\u2019s case under Guideline E.  \n \n \n10. On October 9, 2007, Applicant received a copy of the Appeal Board\u2019s \nRemand Decision. (Item 10) \n \n \n11. On January 16, 2008, the second administrative judge assigned the case \nissued the current Order granting the Government\u2019s motion, and setting an \nAnswer date. (Item 9) \n \n12. On February 9, 2008, Applicant submitted his \u201cResponse to Amended \nStatement of Reasons\u201d.  Applicant again denied the allegations and provided \nadditional information, including a \u201ccopy of the results from a voluntary \npersonality test\u201d.  With his Response, Applicant requested a hearing to address \nthe Guideline E concerns. (Items 10-12) \n \n \n13. In light of Applicant\u2019s request for a hearing, the case was transferred to \nanother Department Counsel responsible for the region in which the case was to \nbe heard. \n \n \n14.  On March 30, 2008, Applicant sent a letter retracting his request for a \nhearing and once again wishing to proceed solely on the written record. (Item 12) \n \n \n15. On April 14, 2008, the case was transferred back to the original Department    \nCounsel for preparation of the Second FORM in this case.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n16. The Amended SOR reads as follows: \n \n\u201c2. Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified \ninformation.  Available information raising this concern shows that: \n \na. You falsified material facts in response to allegation 1.c. of the Statement of \nReasons, dated June 2, 2005, which alleges that \u201cYou are indebted to VW Credit Inc. \n(account #803126881), in the approximate amount of $23,404.00, the balance owed \nafter resale of your automobile which had been repossessed for nonpayment in October \n2000.  As of November 21, 2003, this debt had not been satisfied,\u201d when in your \nAnswer, signed June 24, 2005, you stated that: \u201cI deny the above statement.  The \naccount with VW Credit was filed with bankruptcy courts. I contacted VW Credit \nRecovery Department (866)623-8350 spoke with Ron and confirmed this information.  \nBalance due after sale of automobile was estimated to be $9,000.00 as reported by Ron \nat VW Credit Recovery Dept.  According to the credit report dated 06-09-2005, this \naccount has been closed.\u201d  You knew said response in your Answer was false at the \ntime you made it, because you did not include this vehicle and the specific debt with VW \nCredit Inc., to wit: account #803126881, with your bankruptcy petition. \n \nb. You were discharged from the United States military on March 8, 2000, \nbecause of concerns regarding your judgement (sic) or reliability with regards to \nsafeguarding classified national security information or special nuclear information \nmaterial.\u201d (Item 9) \n \n17.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the Amended SOR on February 9, 2008.  He \ndenied the allegation of falsification contained in Paragraph 2.a. of the Amended SOR.  \nHe contends that he had no other information in his possession showing he owed any \nmoney on a debt for a Volkswagen automobile.  He states his bankruptcy petition shows \nthis vehicle being listed on it.  He concludes the debt was discharged in bankruptcy. \n(Items 6 and 7) \n \n18.   Applicant denied the allegation in Paragraph 2.b. of the Amended SOR based on \nthe contents of his DD 214 showing an \u201cHonorable Discharge\u201d for a \u201cPersonality \nDisorder.\u201d   \n \n19. \nApplicant submitted a Response to the FORM on July 5, 2008.  In that Response \nhe requests a minimum of 12 months time within which \u201cto get his financial affairs in \norder.\u201d  He further states his student loans are in \u201cforbearance.\u201d  His other debts he has \n\u201cstarted to make payments to those as well.\u201d  Applicant does not address or supply any \ninformation concerning the Guideline E allegations, only the Guideline F allegations \nwhich were the subject of the original SOR.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n20. The administrative judge who rendered a decision in that FORM concluded the \nGuideline F allegations for Applicant, which decision was upheld by the DOHA Appeals \nBoard.  Those allegations are not at issue in this Remand Decision. \n \nRemand Findings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 9, 2008, Applicant denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, and 2.b, with explanations. In his Response to the FORM dated \nJuly 5, 2008, Applicant did not address the Guideline E allegations, but instead asked \nfor at least 12 months \u201cto get his financial affairs in order.\u201d  He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n1. Applicant is 40 years old and divorced.  According to his SF 86, he has no \nchildren.  No evidence contained in the file shows he has remarried or has a \nfamily.  His Response to the current FORM states a denial of his security \nclearance \u201cwill be placing (his) family literally homeless at this point.\u201d He works \nfor a defense contractor.  In 2006 and 2008, he withdrew his requests for \nhearings and asked for the case to be decided on the written record because he \nwas working outside the United States. (Items 5, 12, and 16) \n \n2. Applicant purchased two Volkswagen (VW) automobiles in 1999.  The first          \nautomobile he purchased in August 1999.  It was the subject of loan #803126881 \nfrom VW Credit, Inc.  This automobile was repossessed for non-payment under \nthe loan in 2000.  The balance due was $23,404 as of March 7, 2003.  In a credit \nreport dated July 12, 2004, the balance on this repossessed automobile is shown \nas zero. The same amount is shown on the credit report of November 23, 2004.  \nOn August 4, 2006, the balance for this account is shown as zero.  On two other \ncredit reports in the file, including the last one dated April 18, 2008, this account \nis not shown.  (Items 15, 18-23) \n \n3. The second VW car was the subject of loan #803166657.  Applicant bought the \ncar in September 1999.  Applicant\u2019s credit reports show a balance due of \n$12,677 on this loan.  Applicant and his wife reaffirmed the debt on this car, and \nwhen they divorced, she received the car.  Applicant and his wife had a written \nagreement incorporated into the divorce decree allocating the VW car to her.  \n(Items 3 and 15) \n \n4. Applicant\u2019s filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy on May 1, 2001, which was later \nconverted to a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on May 22, 2001.  Applicant listed \n$220,196.78 in debt to be discharged in that bankruptcy action.  Applicant listed \nthe second VW car, loan #803166657, in the bankruptcy.  It was listed on \nSchedule B as personal property.  It was also listed on Schedule C as exempt \nproperty.  Finally, he listed the car and loan on Schedule D because the VW \nCredit, Inc. was a creditor with a secured claim.  Applicant did not list the first VW \nautomobile, loan #803126881, for the repossessed car in the bankruptcy as a \ndebt to be discharged.  This loan was listed in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \n\n \n6 \n \n \nin the \u201cStatement of Financial Affairs\u201d section as a repossessed vehicle.   This \nsection of the bankruptcy petition is not a list of creditors sought to be discharged \nin the bankruptcy, but is a statement of current financial condition of the \npetitioners.  The bankruptcy was discharged on September 12, 2001. (Items 3 \nand 15) \n \n5. Applicant listed the repossession of his VW automobile on his SF 86 as occurring \non October 31, 2000 (Question 35).  The amount owed he listed as $20,000.  He \ndid not list the outstanding balance due as a debt over 180 days delinquent in the \npast seven years (Question 38), nor as a debt on February 26, 2003, as currently \nover 90 days delinquent (Question 39) (Item 16) \n \n6. Applicant gave a written statement to a Government investigator on November \n21, 2003, in which he stated the VW automobile loan #803126881, was \nrepossessed.  He further stated that because the vehicle was sold by the \ndealership, \u201cI have no intention in paying the outstanding balance as reflected on \nmy CBR (credit bureau report)\u201d His personal financial statement submitted with \nthe statement did not show this debt as one which Applicant was paying on a \nmonthly basis. (Item 17) \n \n7. Applicant\u2019s Response to the original SOR stated, \u201cThe account with VW Credit \nwas filed with bankruptcy courts. I contacted VW Credit Recovery Department \n(866)623-8350 spoke with Ron and confirmed this information.  Balance due \nafter sale of automobile was estimated to be $9,000.00 as reported by Ron at \nVW Credit Recovery Dept.  According to the credit report dated 06-09-2005, this \naccount has been closed.\u201d  This Response was notarized. Applicant represented \nthereby the information contained therein was accurate and true. (Item 6) \n \n8. The U.S. Army administratively separated Applicant on March 8, 2000, with an \nHonorable Discharge on the grounds of a personality disorder.  He served about \nseven years on active duty.  During his active duty service in 1999, Applicant was \nreferred to the base mental health clinic for an evaluation.  The report of that \nevaluation, dated September 15, 2003, signed by a clinical psychologist, states \nApplicant was seen five times between July 28, 1999, and January 12, 2000, by \nthe psychologist and administered psychological testing.  The testing and \nconsultations resulted in a report to Applicant\u2019s commander that he was \nexperiencing a \u201cPersonality Disorder and recommended a Chapter 5-13 \nseparation. \nHis \ntesting \nsuggested \nfeelings \nof \nbeing \nmisunderstood, \nunappreciated, and demeaned by others.  As a consequence of discontent and \npossible feelings of entrapment, he may act in a petulant, depressive, and \npassive aggressive manner, criticizing others for what he sees as their lack of \nsupport.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s prognosis was \u201cfair.\u201d  The psychologist opined Applicant \nhad a condition \u201cthat could impair his judgment or reliability, particularly in the \ncontext of safeguarding classified national security information or special nuclear \ninformation or material.\u201d  Applicant disclosed this consultation on his SF 86 in \nQuestion 19.  He admitted in his answer to that question that the consultation did \n\n \n7 \n \n \nnot relate only to marital, family or grief counseling.  Applicant\u2019s Response to the \nAmended SOR, dated February 9, 2008, states the psychological evaluation was \nnot a factor in his administrative discharge, but the reason \u201cwas all stimulated \nfrom personal and family issues.  They were never a part of anything whatsoever \nto do with security concerns.\u201d (Items 10, 13, 14, 16, and 17) \n \n9. Applicant submitted a personality test administered by his current employer on \nAugust 4, 2006, \u201cto show how well (he is) doing overall.\u201d  This personality test is \nnot a psychological evaluation.  The explanation at the beginning of the test \nresults states, \u201cThis individual chose more socially desirable responses than \naverage. This may reflect an accurate self-portrayal, an overly positive self-\nconcept, or a deliberate presentation of a favorable image.\u201d  The final two pages \nof the personality test list occupational fields for which Applicant might be \ncompatible with his personality traits.  Neither part of this personality test is a \nprofessionally administered psychological evaluation by a licensed clinical \npsychologist or psychiatrist. (Item 10) It is given little weight. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nRemand Analysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG E2.A5.1.1:   \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard \nclassified information.  The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nclearance action or administrative termination of further processing for \nclearance eligibility: \n \nE2.A5.1.1.1 Refusal to undergo or cooperate with required security \nprocessing, including medical and psychological testing; or \n \nE2.A5.1.1.2 Refusal to complete required security forms, releases, or \nprovide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, \nsecurity officials or other official representatives in connection with a \npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying also include \n\u201creliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, \nneighbors, and other acquaintances\u201d (E2.A5.1.2.1) concerning an Applicant.  \nFurthermore, \u201cthe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and \nmaterial facts from any personal security questionnaire . .  used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, . . determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness\u201d (E2.A5.1.2.2) may be applicable.  Finally, \u201cdeliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an \n\n \n9 \n \n \ninvestigator, \nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination\u201d \n(E2.A5.1.2.3) may be a concern in this case.  \n \nApplicant told the Government investigator in November 2003 that his VW \nautomobile was repossessed and he had no intention of repaying the outstanding \nbalance due on that car loan debt.  In February 2003, Applicant disclosed the \nrepossession, the amount ($20,000) of the debt, but not that it was delinquent more \nthan 90 and 180 days.  Finally, in his Response to the original SOR, Applicant denied \nthe debt owed on that his car. He stated, the debt was included in his 2001 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, and the amount owed according to the VW Credit, Inc. was $9,000, with the \nadditional statement that a credit report of June 9, 2005, showed the account was \nclosed. The credit report in the FORM, Item 22, dated August 4, 2006, continues to \nshow this debt as delinquent.   \n \nHowever, that car loan was not included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001. It \nwas merely mentioned as a historical item in the Statement of Financial Condition \nsection, not on a schedule of debts to be discharged.  The second VW car Applicant \nbought with his wife was included in the bankruptcy.  The former wife got that car, and it \ncontinues to appear on Applicant\u2019s credit record. \n \nApplicant is the best person to know his debts, and their status. Until his \nResponse to the FORM in 2005, Applicant consistently admitted the debt and that he \nwas not going to repay it.  Only on the Response does he start to claim, with no \nsupporting documentation from VW Credit, Inc., that this first VW car debt was included \nin the 2001 bankruptcy.  The burden is on Applicant to show the facts are true when he \nstates them.  While he could have merely denied the allegation in the SOR, he added \nlanguage which is now shown to be untrue.  Applicant has not supplied any objective \nevidence that the various credit reports are erroneous when they list the debt as owing \nin 2006 and earlier.  Nor has he met his burden of proof to show VW Credit, Inc. was \nnotified that the debt was included in the debts to be discharged.  He makes statements \nwith no supporting proof.   \n \n \nThe Government also contends Applicant\u2019s 2000 discharge from the Army, and \nthe underlying reasons for it, is unfavorable information from his employer, which at that \ntime was the U.S. Army.  Applicant denies these allegations, claiming family and \npersonal issues caused his discharge.  But his disclosure in Question 19 on the SF 86 \ncontradicts his answer and states that the psychological counseling was not due to \nfamily or marital issues. It is clear from the evidence Applicant was discharged in 2000 \nbecause of concerns about his judgment and reliability pertaining to the safeguarding of \nclassified information.  \n \n \nI conclude the Government introduced sufficient evidence to support each of the \nthree disqualifying conditions raised in this case.  Now, the Applicant has the burden to \nprovide evidence of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThere are seven potentially mitigating conditions which could apply. Because the \nunfavorable information was not unsubstantiated and was pertinent to a determination \nof judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability, E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply.  The falsification \nwas not an isolated incident, was recent, and Applicant continues to contend in his \nsubsequent Responses that his original SOR Response was accurate. Therefore, \nE2.A5.1.3.2 does not apply.  Applicant has not made \u201cprompt good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the falsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d so E2.A5.1.3.3 does not \napply.  The remaining four mitigating conditions, by their context and intent, do not apply \nto the facts and situation of this case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant was an adult and a \nveteran with experience in filing out Government forms when he completed the SF 86 \nand answered the original SOR.  There is a pattern of deception in the Responses he \nsubmitted.  For example, he ignores the Guideline E issue in the latest Response, and \ninstead focuses on the Guideline F issue, which was previously decided in his favor.  He \nrequests at least 12 months to get his finances in order so his family will not be \nhomeless, but never submits any evidence he has family dependents.  He admits in the \nSF 86 his counseling was not family or marital related, but now contends it was.  He \nrefuses to pay the delinquent debt for his 1999 VW car, but claims it was discharged in \nhis 2001 bankruptcy when it was not a scheduled debt for discharge.  His written \nstatements are continuously false and misleading, designed to obfuscate and confuse, \nin his attempts to keep his security clearance. There is no rehabilitation or permanent \nbehavioral change evident in his conduct.   \n \nApplicant chose not to have a hearing on his case, which was his option to do.  \nHowever, I was not able to observe his demeanor, listen to his testimony, and judge his \ncredibility because he did not present himself at a hearing where that process could \noccur.  I could only evaluate the totality of the evidence as presented in writing in the \nFORM, and make a decision on that evidence alone. \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Any doubt about a security \nclearance is to be resolved in favor of the national security and not the individual \n(E2.2.2).  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his personal conduct.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept \nagainst Applicant based on the continued pattern of mendacity and inconsistencies \nbetween his various Responses to the original SOR and amended SOR, the SF 86 \nanswers, and the information he submitted in addition to these pieces of information. \n \nRemand Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nRemand Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

It is his position that the Judge should have found the security concerns\npresented by his conduct mitigated because disclosing his drug involvement is no longer an issue for\nhim due to the counseling he is receiving from his drug treatment program.    Applicant\u2019s argument\n2\ndoes not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on March 2, 2006. \nOn May 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 9, 2008; answered it on \nJune 24, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on June 25, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 17, \n2008, and the case was assigned an administrative judge on July 23, 2008. It was \nreassigned to me on July 25, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 29, 2008, \nscheduling the hearing for August 27, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nE, which were admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the \nhearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 11, 2008. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nOn my own motion, I amended the SOR to correct Applicant\u2019s name by adding \nthe suffix, \u201cJr.\u201d (Tr. 45-46).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations under Guideline H \nand denied the allegations of falsification under Guideline E. His admissions in his \nanswer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old engineer/scientist employed by a federal contractor. \nHe has worked for his current employer since February 2002. He worked for another \nfederal contractor from January 1997 to February 2002. He received a security \nclearance in February 1998, and it was revoked in February 2003 because of delinquent \ndebts (GX 3 at 7; Tr. 44). \n \n \nOn July 21, 2004, at about 6:00 p.m., Applicant was stopped by police because \nhe was driving well below the speed limit and weaving across the center line of the \nroad. The officer told Applicant he would issue him a warning. As the officer was writing \nthe warning, he asked Applicant about his trip. He noticed that Applicant was extremely \nnervous, spoke so rapidly he was not understandable, and visibly agitated. The officer \ngave Applicant his warning and told him he was free to leave.  \n \nAs Applicant was returning to his car, the officer asked him several more \nquestions about his travel plans. He advised Applicant that he was driving on a highway \nwhere contraband traffic was heavy. He asked Applicant if he had any guns, knives, \ndrugs or large sums of money in the car. When he asked Applicant if he had any \ncocaine, Applicant hesitated and then said no. The officer asked Applicant if he would \nconsent to a search of his car, and Applicant declined. At some point thereafter, \nApplicant was handcuffed and placed in the police car (Tr. 60-61).  \n \nThe officer summoned a canine team, and it arrived at 7:35 p.m. When the \ncanine alerted, the police searched Applicant\u2019s car and found a baggy of \nmethamphetamine in the center console of the front seat. Applicant was advised of his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nrights and questioned. He admitted the substance was methamphetamine, he had \npurchased it for $20 on that morning, and that he had already used about half of it. He \nwas released at about 8:20 p.m., about two and a half hours after he was initially \nstopped. (GX 6 at 1-5).  \n \n \nIn October 2004, the local prosecutor charged Applicant with possession of a \ndangerous drug and possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia. Both offenses \nwere charged as felonies (GX 5 at 2). A summons was issued in November 2004, and \nan arrest warrant was issued in December 2004 (GX 7). The certificate of service on the \nsummons reflects it was mailed to Applicant\u2019s home address on November 17, 2005 by \ncertified mail, return receipt requested; but there is no return receipt in the record (GX 4 \nat 7). The certificate of execution on the arrest warrant is blank (GX 4 at 6).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in March 2006, he disclosed two shoplifting \narrests that were disposed of by adult diversion. In response to the question about prior \narrests, however, he did not disclose the July 2004 incident. He also did not disclose it \nduring an interview with a security investigator on May 29, 2007 (GX 9; Tr. 32-35). The \ninvestigator discovered the record of the incident after this interview. \n \nDuring another interview with a different security investigator on July 30, 2007, \nApplicant told the investigator he did not disclose the July 2004 incident on his e-QIP \nbecause it was his understanding he was not arrested or charged with any crime. \nApplicant stated he had heard nothing from law enforcement officials about the incident. \nHe also told the investigator he did not disclose the incident because he did not think it \nwould \u201ccome up\u201d during his security investigation, and he was afraid he would not \nreceive a clearance if it were disclosed (GX 3 at 11). At the hearing, he admitted he \nintentionally omitted the information (Tr. 66).  \n \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories and disclosed a \none-time use of methamphetamine in July 2007, and he stated he did not purchase it \n(GX 3 at 3). At the hearing, he admitted his answers to the interrogatories were false \n(Tr. 70). \n \nRegarding the source of the methamphetamine, Applicant told the second \ninvestigator a friend had given him the methamphetamine, and he had snorted one line \nof it about an hour before he began driving (GX 3 at 10). In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant stated he could not remember if he bought the methamphetamine or it was \ngiven to him.  \n \n \nApplicant retained an attorney after he learned about the charges arising from \nthe July 2004 incident. He entered an initial appearance on April 16, 2008, represented \nby counsel (GX 5 at 3-4). He was advised of the charges, ordered to be fingerprinted, \nand released. (GX 5 at 5).  \n \nOn May 27, 2008, Applicant offered a plea agreement providing for pleas of guilty \nand entry into a drug offender treatment program. In return for successful completion of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe treatment program, the agreement provides for dismissal of the charge of \npossessing a dangerous drug, reducing the charge of possessing drug paraphernalia \nfrom a felony to a misdemeanor, and a fine of $100 plus costs (AX B). \n \nApplicant completed the comprehensive evaluation and drug screening phase of \nhis treatment, and he began weekly group therapy on June 17, 2008 (AX C and D). He \nwill not complete his treatment program until December 2008 (Tr. 72). \n \nApplicant testified he started using methamphetamine sometime before \nSeptember 2001, initially using it on weekends, and then progressing to daily use (Tr. \n53-55). He admitted purchasing it on more than one occasion (Tr. 61). He last used \nmethamphetamine in July 2004.  \n \nApplicant testified he no longer uses drugs or consumes alcohol. He has moved \nacross the country to a new job, no longer associates with old friends, and is attending \nchurch regularly. In April 2008, he was given custody of his nine-year-old daughter, to \nwhom he is very devoted (AX A). He is a single parent. A friend who has known him for \n20 years believes Applicant is now focused on the welfare of his daughter and has put \nhimself on the right path toward a productive life (AX E). \n.  \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe SOR alleges a single arrest on July 21, 2004, for felony possession of a \ndangerous drug and felony use or possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to use. \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a \nprescription \ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability \nand \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses use or misuse of Adrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). AG \n\u00b6 24(a)(1).

The evidence raises these two disqualifying \nconditions, shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nThe SOR alleges only a single use of methamphetamine, but the evidence \nreflects years of weekly and sometimes daily use, and it also reflects purchases of \nmethamphetamine on more than one occasion. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be \nconsidered: A(a) to assess an applicant=s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant=s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether \nan applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a \nparticular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide \nevidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.@ ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have considered the evidence \nof uncharged misconduct for these limited purposes.  \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of \u00b6 \n26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on the recentness of drug involvement. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. \n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drug involvement was more than four years ago. He has changed \nhis lifestyle, changed his environment, and is receiving treatment. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) \nis established. Any doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment \narises from his lack of candor, discussed below, and not from his past drug involvement. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4). Applicant has established the first three of the four indicia of \n\u201cdemonstrated intent\u201d encompassed in this mitigating condition. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished because Applicant has not completed his drug treatment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his e-QIP by failing to discose his \npending felony charges for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b); and failing to disclose his purchase and use of drugs (SOR \u00b6 1.c and 1.d). It \nalso alleges he deliberately failed to disclose the July 2004 incident during an interview \nwith a security investigator in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); failed to disclose purchases of \nillegal drugs during an interview with a security investigator in July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); \nand deliberately falsified his response to DOHA interrogatories in January 2008 when \nhe represented that he had only used methamphetamine once and had never \npurchased it (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). A disqualifying \ncondition also may be raised by \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted at the hearing that he intentionally concealed his use of \nmethamphetamine when he submitted his e-QIP. He was vague on the question \nwhether he purchased the methamphetamine in his possession in July 2004, but he \nadmitted earlier purchases. He admitted he intentionally concealed the July 2004 \nincident during his security interview in May 2007. He admitted his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories were false.  \n \n \nBased on all the evidence, I conclude Applicant probably did not receive the \ncriminal charges, summons, and arrest warrant, and was not aware that formal charges \n\n \n8 \n \n \nagainst him were pending at the time he submitted his e-QIP. He was aware, however, \nof his drug involvement; and he intentionally concealed it on his e-QIP, during his May \n2007 security interview, and in response to DOHA interrogatories in January 2008. \nAccordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (b) are raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant made no attempt to correct his omissions and false \nstatements, even though he had an opportunity during the May 2007 security interview. \nHe did not make full disclosure until the hearing. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nDeliberate, knowing, and material falsifications of an e-QIP and during security \ninterviews are felonies, not minor offenses. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Applicant\u2019s \nfalsifications were recent and did not occur under unique circumstances. His lack of \ncandor casts doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. I have \nincorporated my discussion under Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant is an intelligent adult. Since July 2004, he has taken significant steps to \nchange his lifestyle, abstain from drugs, become a responsible adult, and care for his \nnine-year-old daughter. He disclosed his drug abuse in detail at his hearing and \ncandidly admitted falsification of material information. This candor at the hearing is a \npositive indication of rehabilitation. His lack of candor on his e-QIP and during the \nsecurity investigation preceding the hearing, however, raises doubts about his current \nreliability and trustworthiness. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on drug \ninvolvement, but he has not mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Sep. 18, 1992).   In this\ncase, the Judge specifically addressed favorable evidence cited by the Applicant.  See Decision at 2, 6 and 9.\n2\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn March 26, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline H is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n \nApplicant argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline H had been mitigated, as a matter of law, because Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred in the\npast, Applicant has demonstrated that he would not use drugs in the future, and Applicant provided\nclear evidence of rehabilitation.  In support of this argument, Applicant points to the favorable\nevidence in the record, including his participation in counseling, his academic achievements, his\nmilitary service, his outstanding work record, and his significant community service.   Given the\n1\ntotality of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn\nsimply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See\nISCR Case No. 05-02833 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn this case, the Judge made sustainable findings as to a  lengthy and serious history of\nimproper or illegal drug use by an Applicant who was familiar with the security clearance process.\nThat history included illegal marijuana use, sometimes on a daily basis, from approximately 1998\nto at least September 2003.  It also included the purchase of marijuana, three marijuana-related\ncriminal offenses, and the illegal use of marijuana while holding a security clearance granted by the\nDepartment of Defense.  A review of the decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the record evidence relating to the length, seriousness and\nrecency of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\n\n3\nconditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines H is not arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.

On December 11, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant has worked for the same defense contractor for 30 years.  While working in a space\nwith classified computers, he misused company equipment on numerous occasions by making copies\nof music CDs and by viewing and editing personal photographs on a classified computer.  The\nviewing and the editing of the personal photographs also constituted security violations under the\nNational Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  Applicant\u2019s record is otherwise\nunblemished.  After a period of suspension without pay, Applicant returned to his job and retained\nhis security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s overall\nanalysis of the case is flawed because she failed to address or employ the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d\nstandard when evaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation; whether the Judge\u2019s application of\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5 was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law; whether the\nJudge\u2019s application of Security Violations Mitigating Condition 4 was arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law; whether the Judge\u2019s application of Misuse of information Technology Systems\nMitigating Condition 5 was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-\nperson analysis is sustainable.

While the Judge did\nnot specifically mention the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d that Applicant has to demonstrate in terms of\nestablishing extenuation or mitigation where security violations are involved,  there is no language\n1\nin the decision to suggest that she employed a lesser standard.  While a specific enunciation of a\n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d would have been appropriate, its omission does not constitute error.  Decisions\nof DOHA administrative judges are not measured against a standard of perfection.  See, e.g.,  ISCR\nCase No. 95-0319 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 18, 1996).  Department Counsel\u2019s argument appears to be that\nbecause Applicant\u2019s security violations were multiple and deliberate, the fact that the Judge\nconcluded that they were not ultimately security clearance disqualifying is proof that she did not\nemploy the correct standard.  In other words, Department Counsel appears to be arguing that,\nbecause the security violations are disqualifying as a matter of law, the Judge must have employed\nthe wrong standard of review.  This argument is not persuasive.  The record evidence in this case\n\n\u201cThe individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion,\n2\nexploitation, or duress.\u201d\n\u201cPersonal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion,\n3\nexploitation or pressure.\u201d\n\u201cViolations were due to improper or inadequate training.\u201d\n4\n3\nincluded matters in extenuation and mitigation, and the Judge was not required as a matter of law\nto conclude the security violations were disqualifying on this record.  The Judge\u2019s ultimate weighing\nof the record evidence, and her ultimate conclusions, standing alone, do not provide sufficient proof\nthat the Judge employed the wrong legal standard.  Absent more specific indicators in the Judge\u2019s\ndecision that provide evidence of the Judge\u2019s use of an inappropriate standard, Department Counsel\nhas not met its burden of establishing error.      \nThe Judge applied Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5  to the case.  As pointed out by\n2\nDepartment Counsel, vulnerability to coercion or duress as a result of misuse of technology or\nsecurity violations was not an issue raised by the government in the SOR.  By its plain meaning,\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5 addresses the concerns covered by Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition 4.   See, e.g., ADP Case No. 30-1130 at 5-6 (App. Bd. January 4, 2001).\n3\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 4 was not discussed by or relied upon by the Judge and,\ngiven its absence, she did not articulate an adequate basis for the inclusion of Personal Conduct\nMitigating Condition 5.  In this instance, Department Counsel has met its burden of establishing\nerror. \nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge erred by applying Security Violations Mitigating\nCondition 3  to the case.  In support of this argument Department Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s\n4\nconclusion that the \u201clax\u201d security training by Applicant\u2019s employer was a matter in mitigation is\nunsupported by the record evidence.  Department Counsel notes that, at the hearing, Applicant\nprovided evidence that his employer had not strictly enforced the security procedures and NISPOM\nprovisions he had violated for a number of years.  Department Counsel goes on to state that the\nJudge erred by conflating the concept of relaxed enforcement of security rules with the concept of\nsecurity training, and that relaxed enforcement does not rise to the level of mitigation.  The Board\ndoes not agree.  Even if the concept of lax enforcement of rules is not included within the purview\nof Security Violations Mitigating Condition 3, the Judge could still evaluate it as a matter in\nmitigation when doing a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis of the totality of the record evidence.  Moreover,\non this record, there is substantial record evidence of the fact that, prior to an investigation of\nApplicant and his subsequent disciplining,  Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s security training program was\nperfunctory at best.  The evidence supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that this resulted in a situation\nwhere, when coupled with lack of rule enforcement, Applicant and his fellow employees were\nlargely unfamiliar with security rules that related to the specific practice of loading and editing\npersonal photographs onto classified computers.  Thus, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the employer\u2019s\ninadequate training program was a contributing factor to the violations, and was therefore mitigating,\nis sustainable.\n\n\u201c[actions that] Demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d \n5\n\u201cThe misuse was followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation.\u201d\n6\n4\nDepartment Counsel complains that the Judge inappropriately applied Security Violations\nMitigating Condition 4.   Department Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating\n5\ncondition was based solely on her conclusion that there was no evidence that Applicant violated any\nof the provisions of the NISPOM and/or his employer\u2019s rules since his reinstatement in 2003.  The\nBoard concludes that Department Counsel is reading the Judge\u2019s decision too narrowly.  In her\ndecision, the Judge went beyond the basic finding that Applicant has committed no security\nviolations since 2003 and also found that Applicant had demonstrated a renewed sense of\ncommitment to security rules and regulations and has been diligent in ensuring that he abides by all\nthe rules and procedures since 2003.  A review of the record evidence convinces the Board that these\nfindings of the Judge are sustainable.  Department Counsel also argues that when applying Security\nViolations Mitigating Condition 4, the Judge did not take into consideration the frequency,\nseriousness and deliberateness of Applicant\u2019s security violations and Applicant\u2019s initial false and\nevasive responses to inquiries during a March 2003 investigation into possible compromises of\nclassified information.  There is a rebuttable presumption that an administrative judge has considered\nall the record evidence unless he or she states otherwise.  Department Counsel does not overcome\nthat presumption here.  The record indicates that the Judge did consider the frequency and\ndeliberateness of Applicant\u2019s actions and did not mitigate the government\u2019s concerns on those bases.\nThe frequency and deliberateness of Applicant\u2019s security violations and his evasiveness during the\ninitial phase of the investigation do not make the mitigating factor inapplicable as a matter of law.\nAt most, they go to the weight that the Judge could reasonably assign to the mitigating factor.  After\nreviewing the entire record, which includes substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s improved attitude\nand conscientious security practices since his suspension, the Board is not persuaded that the Judge\napplied Security Violations Mitigating Condition 4 in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\nDepartment Counsel next argues that the Judge erred by applying Misuse of Information\nTechnology Mitigating Factor 5.   Department Counsel\u2019s assertion is persuasive.  While there is\n6\nample record evidence to support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant demonstrated a positive\nattitude toward security responsibilities after 2003, there is no record evidence to support a\nconclusion that Applicant took affirmative, noteworthy steps to correct the misuse of his company\u2019s\ncomputer equipment either before or immediately after his company found out about it.  In this\ninstance, the fact that Applicant engaged in the misuse of computers briefly after he learned that his\nemployer was becoming concerned about it and the fact that Applicant was initially uncooperative\nduring the company\u2019s investigation into the matter necessarily preclude the application of Misuse\nof Technology Mitigating Factor 5, which contemplates prompt, affirmative corrective measures\nundertaken in good faith.           \n \nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is unsustainable and\nundercuts an analysis of the Government\u2019s concerns under the specific Guidelines.  The Board does\nnot agree.\nDepartment Counsel states that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis consists of a short list of\nfavorable facts which erroneously rely on the same unsupported conclusions that were inadequate\n\n5\nunder the specific mitigating conditions of Guidelines K, E, and M.  Inasmuch as the Board has\nsustained several of the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding the applicability of specific mitigating\nconditions, this argument is significantly undercut.  Additionally, contrary to Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis consists only of collective consideration of the same\nindividual components that relate to each mitigating condition, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nwhole person analysis is appropriately broader than her analysis of the case under the individual\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions.  The Judge\u2019s whole person considerations include: (a)\nApplicant\u2019s successful 30-year history with his employer; (b) the practice of copying CD music tapes\n(not involving classified systems)and loading personal photographs onto classified computer systems\nwas widespread among members of Applicant\u2019s shop; (c) because of his unusual facility with\ncomputers, Applicant often copied for others at their request as well as himself; (d) Applicant\u2019s\nactivities were conducted in the open during work hours with the full knowledge of the workforce;\nand (e) importantly, much of Applicant\u2019s activity was requested by his immediate supervisor, who\ngave him at least tacit and constructive approval of the activity, and even encouraged Applicant to\ndo copying for him after it was apparent that the company was looking into the unauthorized\npractices.\nIn his reply brief, Applicant insists that the Judge\u2019s decision was rationally based on all the\nevidence presented.  The Board need not agree with the Judge\u2019s ultimate disposition of the case to\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s assertion is correct.  Notwithstanding the Judge\u2019s errors identified herein,\nremand would serve no useful purpose as the decision as a whole is sustainable.   \n \n          \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

There is ample record evidence that Applicant was dishonest and\ndeceptive immediately after he was caught.  There is one piece of evidence that reports that\nApplicant remained so for at least two months after he was caught.  A May 26, 2003 Security\nViolation \u2014Report of Findings says Applicant \u201chas been uncooperative and deceptive regarding\n\n6\nwhat equipment and processes he used to copy his personal items.\u201d  The same report found that the\nrisk of compromise to classified information from Applicant\u2019s was \u201cHIGH.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s dishonesty and failure to cooperate were not alleged in the SOR.  Neither the\nAdministrative Judge nor the Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform with the\nevidence, although either one could have done so (Directive, \u00b6E3.1.17).  The failure to amend the\nSOR has produced an anomaly where Applicant is eligible for a favorable decision in light of what\nwas alleged but would have been ineligible if all the pertinent record evidence of his conduct were\nproperly at issue.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 30, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline K (Security Violations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 27, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings;\nwhether the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s falsifications of his security clearance application,\ntwo documents filed in state judicial proceedings, and a signed, sworn statement to a government\ninvestigator, were deliberate; whether the SOR placed Applicant on reasonable notice of the\nallegations against him; whether the Judge was barred by the doctrine of res judicata from\nconsidering evidence of \u201csettled past cases\u201d relating to the allegations set forth in the SOR; whether\nthe Judge\u2019s overall adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge erred with respect to six of his findings, in that the\n\u201csummary\u201d presented by the Judge in his decision omitted certain facts, and did not reflect the full\nnature and circumstances of the incidents at issue.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument\npersuasive. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nhe specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997);\nDISCR Case No. 93-1186 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 1995).  Moreover, the Judge is not required to cite\nor discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006); DISCR Case No. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 1992).\nSeveral of the findings which Applicant challenges relate to SOR allegations on which the\nJudge found in favor of the Applicant.  With respect to the remaining ones, even if each of the\nchallenged findings were changed to reflect Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the record evidence, the\nchanges would not have undermined the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions.  Therefore, any such errors\nwould be at best harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00949 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 05-08459 at 2, n. 1 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2006).  \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).   The Board does not review a case de novo.  Applicant has not met his burden of\ndemonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering\nthe record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial evidence and are sustainable. \n\nApplicant\u2019s Appeal Brief at 6.\n1\nThe adverse information which Applicant failed to disclose related to his prior employment, a state tax lien,\n2\na prior investigation by the police, and a prior denial of clearance access.\nApplicant\u2019s Appeal Brief at 8.\n3\n3\n(2) Applicant also contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication, two documents filed in state judicial proceedings, and a signed, sworn statement to a\ngovernment investigator, because \u201c[o]ne need not report items of no consequence.\u201d   The Board does\n1\nnot find this argument persuasive.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.   The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or\n2\nreject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are\nsustainable.   See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26,\n2006).\n(3) Applicant argues that the SOR did not place him on reasonable notice of the allegations\nagainst him because: \u201cThe action of de-facto adding to the Statement of Reasons by admitting new\nevidence (as occurred in our case) we consider to be a breach of FRCP Rule 15 and other as\nappropriate.\u201d   The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\n3\nApplicant is entitled to receive an SOR that places him on reasonable notice of the allegations\nbeing made against him.  However, an SOR is an administrative pleading that is not required to\nsatisfy the strict requirements of a criminal indictment, and it does not have to allege every possible\nfact that may be relevant at the hearing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24,\n2003).  Nor does an SOR have to indicate what arguments Department Counsel might make at the\nhearing, nor does the SOR have to identify specific evidence that Department Counsel will rely on\nat the hearing.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the SOR issued to\nApplicant placed him on adequate notice of the allegations being made against him.  Furthermore,\na review of the hearing transcript does not leave the Board with the impression that the SOR\nprejudiced in any identifiable way Applicant\u2019s ability to prepare for the hearing, his ability to\nparticipate in the hearing, his ability to raise objections or make arguments on his behalf, or his\nability to present evidence for the Judge to consider in his case.  Given the SOR allegations against\nApplicant and the manner in which the hearing was conducted, Applicant was on adequate notice\nof the factual circumstances that formed the basis of the government\u2019s security concerns in his case.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-24428 at 3 (App. Bd. May 3, 2006).  Moreover, the record indicates that\nthe Judge declined to admit into evidence a number of government exhibits that he ruled were\nirrelevant or beyond the scope of the allegations contained in the SOR.  There is no presumption of\nerror below, and Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings were erroneous.\n(4) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge was barred by the doctrine of res judicata from considering evidence of his past relating\nto some of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\n\n4\nRes judicata involves issue preclusion when the same claim or cause of action has been\nlitigated previously.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0191 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 1998).  It has no\napplicability in this case.  Applicant was granted a security clearance after a DISCR hearing in 1986.\nApplicant reapplied for a security clearance in 2000 and was asked to complete a security clearance\napplication.  On that application, Applicant did not reveal past conduct and events relating to his\nfinances, employment and prior security clearances.  The scope of some of the questions on the\nsecurity clearance application required Applicant to divulge events that predated 1986.  On appeal,\nApplicant argues that because his security clearance eligibility was favorably adjudicated in 1986,\nany facts or circumstances arising before 1986 cannot provide a basis for an adverse security\nclearance decision in the instant case.\nA favorable security clearance decision does not give an applicant the right to retain a\nsecurity clearance regardless of subsequent events or changed circumstances.  See, e.g., DISCR Case\nNo. 86-3543 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 1989).  Accordingly, the doctrine of res judicata does not bar\nan adverse security clearance decision when an applicant has engaged in misconduct subsequent to\na favorable security clearance decision.  DISCR Case No. 91-1436 at 4 (May 3, 1993); DISCR Case\nNo. 91-0775 at 3 (Aug. 25, 1992).  In this case, Applicant\u2019s history prior to 1986, in and of itself,\ndoes not form the basis for the SOR allegations.  Rather, Applicant\u2019s failure to provide truthful\nanswers in 2000 about events prior to 1986 when required to do so by the questions on his security\nclearance application forms the basis for some of the allegations in the SOR.  The mere fact that\nApplicant obtained a favorable security clearance determination in 1986 did not relieve him of the\nduty, subsequently, to answer security clearance application questions truthfully, even when those\nquestions required the revealing of information that predated 1986.  This is consistent with the basic\nproposition that when reevaluating an applicant\u2019s security eligibility in keeping with the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, such a reevaluation should consider the applicant\u2019s overall history, not just the most\nrecent instances of the applicant\u2019s conduct.  Thus, since Applicant\u2019s underlying conduct and\ncircumstances that predated 1986 could have been considered in the instant case, his failure to list\nthe same underlying conduct and circumstances on a 2000 security clearance application provide a\nproper basis for the falsification allegations in this case.   \n(5) Finally, Applicant argues, in essence, that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Part of Applicant\u2019s argument is based on the assertion\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision should be reversed because it contains multiple \u201cerrors of logic.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Appeal Brief does not elaborate on or enumerate with specificity what these \u201cerrors of\nlogic\u201d are.  The appealing party must set forth its claims of error with specificity.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 99-0519 at 9 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2001).  Applicant has failed to so in this instance.  \nRegarding the broader issue of whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law, the application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n5\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline K and with\nrespect to two of factual allegations under Guideline E.  However, the Judge reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all\nof the government\u2019s security concerns.  As noted above, the Board does not review a case de novo.\nThe favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App.\nBd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable\nclearance decision under Guideline E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

On October 30, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.   Applicant timely appealed\n1\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give adequate weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence and did not find in favor of Applicant\nwith respect to debts that he had resolved after the hearing.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nApplicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly\ndisagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ADP Case No.\n05-03939 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 1, 2006).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time the hearing, Applicant still had delinquent debts and was still in\nthe process of resolving his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  The Judge weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant with respect to many of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all\nof the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept.\n28, 2006).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness\ndecision under Guidelines F is sustainable.  Thus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems in\nADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 17, 2006,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant failed to disclose information  to a security clearance investigation interviewer that he was\nrequired to disclose is supported by the record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion under\nGuideline E that Applicant was required to disclose the fact that he was under investigation at his\nworkplace for misuse of a computer network was inconsistent with the Judge\u2019s conclusion under\nGuideline M that the workplace violation was unintentional and insignificant; whether the Judge\u2019s\nfinding against Applicant on an allegation under Guideline E that Applicant had misused a\nworkplace computer network was inconsistent with her earlier favorable finding regarding the same\nfacts as alleged under Guideline M; and whether the Judge\u2019s overall security clearance decision was\narbitrary and capricious under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.   The Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision.\nApplicant argues on appeal that there is insufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that, during an initial interview with a DoD investigator on April 17, 2002, Applicant was\nrequired to disclose the fact that he had been under investigation from November 2001 to February\n2002 for misuse of his workplace computer network and failed to do so.  The Board does not agree.\nSubparagraph 2.b. of the SOR alleged: \u201cDuring your initial security interview with an authorized\ninvestigator of the Department of Defense, you deliberately failed to disclose the . . . investigation\nconcerning the conduct set forth in paragraph 1., above, due to your fear that this incident would\nnegatively impact your security clearance.\u201d  Paragraph 1 of the SOR referenced Applicant\u2019s alleged\nmisuse of his workplace computer system.  In his answer to the SOR dated October 11, 2005,\nApplicant stated the following: \u201cOn paragraph 2 and subparagraph (b), I admit (emphasis supplied)\nmy failure to fully disclose and deliberately not inform the investigator of the . . . investigation\nconcerning my conduct as set forth in paragraph (1) because of fear that it would affect my current\nclearance as well as future ones.\u201d  Applicant, in essence, made the same admission earlier in a\nwritten statement prepared for an investigator on October 31, 2002 , and later in his hearing\n1\ntestimony before the Administrative Judge.   Department Counsel has the burden of presenting\n2\nevidence to prove controverted facts. See Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s admissions concerning the alleged falsification, perpetrated in this case by a\nwillful omission of information required to be disclosed, were unqualified and unequivocal.  If an\napplicant admits an SOR allegation, then such admission provides an administrative judge with a\nlegally sufficient basis to find  that the applicant engaged in the conduct covered by the applicant\u2019s\nadmission.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-21087 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug.19, 2005).  Applicant\u2019s argument\nto the contrary is without merit.\nApplicant argues that since the Administrative Judge determined that the conduct for which\nApplicant was investigated was neither recent nor significant and that it was isolated, unintentional\nand inadvertent, then his failure to disclose it to the interviewer should not be held against him under\n\n3\nGuideline E.  Applicant is essentially arguing that he should not be held accountable for the omission\nsince the Judge ultimately concluded that the underlying conduct that was the basis of the\nfalsification allegation was not of security significance.  Applicant\u2019s contention is not persuasive.\nFailure to provide relevant and material information to the government provides a rational basis for\nan unfavorable security decision. See Gayer v. Schlesinger, 490 F.2d 740, 753-754 (D.C. Cir. 1973);\nClifford v. Shoultz, 413 F.2d 868 (9  Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 962 (1969).  Accordingly,\nth\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions under Guideline E regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the investigation\ninto his workplace conduct provide a rational basis, independent of the Judge\u2019s favorable\nconclusions under Guideline M, for her unfavorable security clearance decision.\nAlso regarding Guideline E, Applicant appears to argue that because the Judge entered a\nfavorable finding regarding his underlying workplace conduct under Guideline M, her adverse\nfinding under Guideline E regarding the same underlying conduct was inconsistent with the first\nfinding and without basis.  To the extent Applicant argues that Guideline E does not provide any\nindependent basis for an adverse decision in the case after the Judge ruled in his favor under\nGuideline M, Applicant\u2019s argument lacks merit.  An Applicant\u2019s security related conduct can be\nalleged under more than one Guideline and, in an appropriate case, can be given independent weight\nby an administrative judge under different Guidelines.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 93-1251 at 4 (July\n29, 1994).  In this case, there is a rational basis for an SOR allegation involving Applicant\u2019s\nworkplace conduct to be included under both Guideline M and Guideline E, and it was therefore\nlegally permissible for the Judge to consider Applicant\u2019s conduct under both and to reach differing\nconclusions under both, so long as the Judge articulated a rational basis for each.  The Board notes\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision does not articulate a rationale for ultimately finding against Applicant for\nthe underlying workplace conduct under Guideline E.  Given the Judge\u2019s conclusions under\nGuideline M that Applicant\u2019s workplace conduct (misuse of his employer\u2019s computer system) was\nmitigated because it was not recent, and was insignificant, unintentional, and inadvertent, the Judge\u2019s\nfailure to articulate a rationale for why the same conduct was ultimately disqualifying under\nGuideline E was error.  However, the Board concludes that it is unnecessary to remand the case to\nthe Judge for correction of this error, as her adverse conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s willful\nconcealment of information under Guideline E are sustainable and provide an adequate basis for her\noverall adverse security clearance decision. \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s conclusions that the case was not mitigated and that he was\nnot entitled to a favorable decision under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept were arbitrary and capricious.\nApplicant\u2019s argument is not persuasive.  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor under SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 3.a, 3b, and 3.c. However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any\nmitigating conditions or whole person factors with respect to the allegation under \u00b6 2.b. of the SOR,\nthe one alleging his deliberate failure to disclose.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance\ndecision was not arbitrary or capricious.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 17,\n2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Christopher Graham denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making a factual\nfinding that Applicant was the sole means of support for his parents residing in Pakistan, whether\nApplicant is entitled to a favorable security clearance decision as a result of his having been awarded\na Top Secret security clearance from another government agency, and whether the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error,  the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision. \nThe portion of this case germane to Applicant\u2019s appeal involves allegations of foreign\ninfluence, primarily as a result of the status of Applicant\u2019s parents as residents of and citizens of\nPakistan, and Applicant\u2019s ties to them.   In his findings of fact, the Judge determined that Applicant\n1\nwas the sole source of support for his parents.  On appeal, Applicant asserts that this finding is not\nsupported by the record evidence and references a passage in the hearing transcript where he\nindicates that his uncle and brother live in the same house as his parents and also support the family.2\nAfter a review of the record, the Board concludes that it was error for the Judge to find that\nApplicant was his parents\u2019 only means of support.  However, when evaluating this single factual\nerror in the context of the totality of the record evidence and the entirety of the Judge\u2019s findings and\nconclusions, the Board concludes that this error was harmless.  There is ample support in the record\nfor the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision.\nApplicant asks the Board to take into account the fact that he passed a full scope polygraph\nfor another government agency \u201cthat has full knowledge of all the issues brought into question by\nthese proceedings\u201d and that he was awarded a Top Secret clearance by them.  Applicant\u2019s assertion\nbears on the issue of the application of the reciprocity provisions of Section 2-204 of the National\nIndustrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  Section 2-204 reads as follows:\nFederal agencies that grant access to classified information to their employees or their\ncontractor employees are responsible for determining whether such employees have\nbeen previously cleared or investigated by the Federal Government.  Any previously\ngranted PCL  that is based upon a current investigation of a scope that meets or\n3\nexceeds that necessary for the clearance required, shall provide the basis for issuance\nof a new clearance, without further investigation or adjudication unless significant\nderogatory information that was not previously adjudicated becomes known to the\ngranting agency.  \nThe issue of whether a prior security clearance held by Applicant might trigger the reciprocity\nprovisions of Section 2-204 of the NISPOM was not raised below by Applicant.  In his hearing\n\nThis case is  distinguishable from the Board\u2019s disposition in ISCR Case No. 98-0320 (App. Bd. Apr. 8, 1999).\n4\nIn that case, a document providing specific details about a previously granted clearance was offered by Applicant at the\nhearing and admitted into evidence.  Applicant relied on that evidence in making the specific argument, both at the\nhearing and on appeal, that the earlier grant of a clearance should result in a favorable disposition in the DOHA\nadjudication.  With that background, the Board remanded the case with instructions to the Judge to allow the parties to\ndevelop the record concerning the applicability of Section 2-203 (the applicable NISPOM provision at the time on the\nsubject of reciprocity) to Applicant\u2019s case. \n3\ntestimony, Applicant made general references to previous clearances held by him in the context of\nproviding  background information to the Judge, but his testimony provides nothing specific in terms\nof the identities of the granting agencies, or the dates involved.  Applicant\u2019s security clearance\napplication, which is part of the record, contains no information about previous clearances.\nSimilarly, Applicant\u2019s appeal assertions contain no specific information about the date of the\ngranting of the particular clearance he is referencing, or the identity of the granting agency.  There\nis no other evidence in the record to indicate whether or not the several prerequisites for the granting\nof reciprocity listed in Section 2-204 of the NISPOM have been satisfied in this case.\nThere is no presumption of error below and Applicants must present issues on appeal with\nsufficient specificity to enable the Board to carry out its appellate review responsibilities under the\nDirective.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0429 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 9, 2001).  On appeal, Applicant asks\nthe Board to take into consideration the fact that he was granted an earlier clearance but he does not\nmake a claim of reciprocity under Section 2-204 of the NISPOM.  No such issue was raised below,\nand the record contains no details or corroborating evidence to provide even a threshold\nsubstantiation for any claim that Applicant is entitled to favorable disposition of this case as a result\nof an earlier security clearance adjudication.  Based on the record before us, and Applicant\u2019s\nassertions on appeal, the Board will not assume that Applicant intended to raise a claim of error\nbased on the requirements of Section 2-204.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that Applicant  fails\nto raise a colorable claim that DOHA processed his case in a manner inconsistent with applicable\nregulations, including the NISPOM.4\nApplicant also asks the Board to reconsider the decision below and to reinstate his clearance.\nInasmuch as the Board does not engage in de novo review, it construes Applicant\u2019s request as raising\nthe issue of whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Board has\nconsidered the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole, and concludes that it is reasonably\nsupported by the evidence.\n\n4\n         \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 10, 2006, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President issued\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September\n1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was dated before\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the former guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 2, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on March 1, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 19, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nThe government offered seven exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-7.  Applicant offered 11 exhibits,\nmarked as Exhibits A-K.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 2.a.\nthrough 2.d., 3.a., and 3.c.  He denied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 33-year-old linguist/interpreter working as an independent contractor for a\nfederal agency.   He was widowed in 2004, when his wife was killed in an automobile accident.\n1\n2\nHe has one child, born in 2006, who is a citizen because her mother is a U.S. citizen.   He has a\n3\nmaster\u2019s degree in mathematics.   He immigrated to the United States in 1998.   He served in the\n4\n5\nUnited States Air Force from May 1999 until May 2003.  He received an honorable discharge in\n\nId. at 17.\n6\nId. at 19-20.\n7\nAnswer to SOR, dated February 4, 2006, at 1.\n8\nTr. at 31.\n9\nId. at 32.\n10\nId. at 1-2.\n11\nTr. at 38, 65-66.\n12\nId. at 39, 58.\n13\nId. at 39-41.\n14\nId. at 57.\n15\nId. at 58.\n16\nAnswer to SOR, supra, note 7, at 2-3.\n17\n4\n2003, and left active service as a senior airman E-4.  He is now in the inactive Air Force Reserve.6\nHe has held a security clearance since January 2003, when he became a naturalized citizen.7\nApplicant held a Pakistani passport that was issued on October 4, 2002, valid until October\n23, 2007.  He became a U.S. citizen in January 2003.  He exercised dual citizenship with Pakistan\nand the United States, after January 2003.  He used his Pakistani passport for travel to Pakistan in\n2002, 2003, and 2004.  Prior to January 2003, Applicant was not a citizen and had no U.S. passport\nto use.  The Air Force approved his leave to Pakistan in 2002, and knew he only carried a Pakistani\npassport.  This passport expired, and he had to renew it in order to leave the country and return to\nhis Air Force duty.   During 2003, he traveled to Pakistan on emergency leave to attend the funerals\n8\nof his grandparents.   Because he was in a remote location and due to the emergency of the situation,\n9\nhe was forced to use his Pakistani passport as an entry visa in conjunction with his U.S. passport.\nIn 2004, he again had an emergency trip to Pakistan, when his wife was killed in an automobile\naccident.   He used his U.S. passport for these emergency trips, and also used his Pakistani passport\n10\nas an entry visa.  The government contractor sanctioned his use of dual passports.   At this hearing,\n11\nhe renounced his Pakistani citizenship and cut his passport in half.12\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents, six siblings, and extended family members are citizens and\nresidents of Pakistan.  His parents , siblings, and their families all live together in one residential\ncompound.   None are associated with the Pakistani government.  Two uncles, who are engineers,\n13\nwork for local governments.  None have military experience.   Applicant provides the only income\n14\nhis parents receive, sending them about $1,000 per month.   Three brothers work in retail\n15\nbusinesses, and three sisters go to college.   He traveled to Pakistan from December 2000 to January\n16\n2001, from September 2002 to October 2002, in November 2003, and from March to April 2004.17\nWhen Applicant executed his security clearance application (SF 86), on April 4, 2003, he\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question \u201c15. Your Foreign Activities - Passport  In the last seven\n\nTr.  at 60-61.\n18\nId. at 62-63.\n19\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit K (Letter of Recommendation, dated February 2, 2004) at 1.\n20\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit J (Letter of Recommendation, dated March 2, 2004) at 1.\n21\n5\nyears, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign government?\u201d  He failed to\ndisclose that he had an active Pakistani passport.  He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question: \u201c16.\nForeign Countries You Have Visited  Have you traveled outside the United States on other than\nofficial U.S. Government orders in the last 7 years (travel as a dependent or contractor must be\nlisted.)  Do not repeat travel covered in modules 4, 5, and 6.\u201d  He did not disclose his travel in 2000\nand 2002.  He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the same numbered questions on a SF 86 executed by him on\nOctober 31, 2003, failing to disclose the same information set forth, above.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 15, because he had shown his Pakistani passport to his\nsecurity officer, who advised him that his passport was a \u201ctourist passport\u201d and not a \u201cdiplomatic\u201d\nor \u201cofficial\u201d passport, and therefore, his passport was not covered by the definition \u201cissued by a\nforeign government.\u201d   He followed the advice of his security officer and did not list his passport.\n18\nBecause his 2000 travel was for less than 30 days, his security officer advised him that he did not\nhave to list the travel.   But he disclosed his travel in detail to both his security officer and the\n19\nDefense Security Service (DSS) investigator, and neither mentioned any need to change his answers.\nHis 2002 travel was for more than 30 days, and he listed it in Module 4 \u201cWhere have You Lived,\u201d\nand was not required to list it under this question.  These reasons, apply to his answers on both the\nApril and October 2003, security clearance applications.  Applicant did not provide any\ncorroborating evidence to his testimony about his false answers.\nApplicant served as an interpreter with a special operations team in support of Operation\nEnduring Freedom.  Team members said this:  \nApplicant possess\u2019s great personal character, courage, and is reliable in every\nsituation.  The job is dangerous and he is one of the few who have met all of the\nrequirements, and then some.  Everyone on the team knew they could depend on him.\nHis command of the language is unparalleled and his extensive knowledge of the\nnumerous accents in the regions made communicating with the populous hassle\nfree.20\nApplicant is a highly motivated, productive, and efficient individual.  His language\nskills are the best of any interpreter we have worked with.21\nApplicant also worked with the Combat Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs).  One of the judges\ncommented:\nApplicant is solid under pressure.  Of all the positions or responsibilities in a\ncourtroom, none is more intense than that of an interpreter.  The interpreter must stay\nfocused at all times because every spoken word must be translated.  He had no\nreservations about serving as the interpreter.  His performance was outstanding.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit F (Letter of Recommendation, dated January 29, 2005) at 1.\n22\nGovernment Exhibit 7 (Congressional Research Service, Pakistan - U.S. Relations, October 8, 2004) at 6.\n23\nGovernment Exhibit 6 (U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning, dated December 5, 2006) at 1.\n24\nTr. at 59.\n25\n6\nSince the first case, Applicant continued to impress tribunal members.  All of his\ncases run smoothly and efficiently because he accurately and quickly communicates\nthe questions and answers for the witness and the members.  \n22\nTerrorist Activity in Pakistan\nPakistan is known to be a base for numerous terrorist organizations and the country continues\nto suffer from anti-Shia, anti-Christian, and anti-Western terrorism.   The Department of State\n23\ncontinues to warn U.S. citizens against non-essential travel to Pakistan in light of the threat of\nterrorist activity.  Family members of official Americans assigned to the embassy in Islamabad and\nto three consulates in Pakistan were ordered to leave the country in March 2002, and have not been\nallowed to return.  The presence of Al Qaeda, Taliban elements, and indigenous sectarian groups\nposes a potential danger to American citizens, especially along the porous border with Afghanistan.\nContinuing tensions in the Middle East also increase the possibility of violence against Westerners\nin Pakistan.  Terrorists and their sympathizers have demonstrated their willingness and capability\nto attack targets where Americans are known to congregate or visit, such as hotels, clubs and\nrestaurants, places of worship, schools, or outdoor recreation events.  American fast food restaurants\nand other companies in Karachi were bombed in late 2005, resulting in several deaths and multiple\ninjuries among Pakistani employees and customers.  On March 2, 2006, an American diplomat, his\nlocally employed driver, and three others were killed when a suicide bomber detonated a car packed\nwith explosives in front of the U.S. Consulate in Karachi.  Fifty-two others were wounded.\nOccasional sectarian violence has resulted in fatal bomb attacks in Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta,\nLahore, and other Pakistani cities in 2006.   Some people living in the village where his family lives\n24\ncould be supportive of the Taliban or Al Qaeda.  \n25\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure\n2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n26\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates]\n27\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether\nApplicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July\n6, 2006). \n7\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.   The\n26\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).27\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\nMemorandum, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, \u201cGuidance\n28\nto DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative\nGuideline,\u201d August 16, 2000. It is known as the \u2018Money Memorandum\u2019 because it was issued by Arthur L. Money,\nAssistant Secretary of Defense. \n8\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Preference\nThe government has established its case under Guideline C by showing that Applicant has\nexercised dual citizenship with Pakistan by possessing and using a Pakistani passport.  Therefore,\nForeign Preference Disqualifying Conditions (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. (The exercise of dual citizenship)\nand E2.A3.1.2.2. (Possession and/or use of a foreign passport) are applicable.\nThe DoD \u201cMoney Memorandum\u201d  of August 16, 2000, clarifies DoD policy regarding the\n28\npossession and/or use of foreign passports.  It requires that \u201cany clearance be denied or revoked\nunless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the\nappropriate agency of the United States Government.\u201d  Under the Money Memorandum, possession\nand/or use of a foreign passport is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety,\nrequirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  However, Applicant expressed\na willingness to renounce dual citizenship and took the demonstrative step of cutting his passport\ninto two pieces, effectively making applicable Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.4.\n(Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship).\nApplicant\u2019s use of his Pakistani passport before January 2003, is obvious because he did not\nbecome a U.S. citizen until then, and could not obtain a U.S. passport until he became a citizen.  His\ntwo trips after he became a citizen were emergency in nature, he was on active duty in foreign\ncountries, and he used his Pakistani passport as means of a visa, precluding a trip back to the United\nStates to obtain a Pakistani visa.  The trips were authorized by his employers and Foreign Preference\nMitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.3. (Activity is sanctioned by the United States) applies.  I conclude\nGuideline C for Applicant.\nForeign Influence\nThe government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant\u2019s parents, siblings,\nand extended family are citizens and residents of Pakistan.  Foreign Influence Disqualifying\nCondition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual\nhas close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country)\n\nISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n29\nISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004). \n30\nDirective, \u00b6 E2. A2. 1.3.1.\n31\n9\nis applicable.  A security risk may exist when an applicant\u2019s immediate family, or other persons to\nwhom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U. S., or may\nbe subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could\nresult in the compromise of classified information. \nWhile family ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying\nunder Guideline B, such ties raise a prima facie security concern.  This concern is sufficient to\nrequire an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the\napplicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance.29\nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. provides (A determination that\nthe immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters),\ncohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States).  Applicants must establish: (1) that the individuals in\nquestion are not \u201cagents of a foreign power,\u201d and (2) that they are not in a position to be exploited\nby a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved\nand the United States.30\nApplicant\u2019s brothers and sister do not meet the definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d under\n50 U.S.C. \u00a7 438(6) and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b).  Similarly, they would not be considered as an \u201cagent\nof a foreign power\u201d under the more expansive definition adopted by the Appeal Board.  The\navailable evidence indicates his brothers and sister have no ties to or economic dependence upon the\nPakistani government. \nThe second prong of the test is whether the relatives in question are \u201cin a position to be\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d   The federal statute, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a), defines\n31\n\u201cforeign power\u201d to include: a foreign government; a faction of a foreign nation; an entity openly\nacknowledged by a foreign government to be controlled by that foreign government; a group engaged\nin international terrorism; a foreign-based political organization; or an entity directed and controlled\nby a foreign government. \nTo determine whether Applicant is \u201cin a position to be exploited by a foreign power,\u201d I must\nexamine Applicant\u2019s connection to his family in the foreign country.  Although his family residing\nin Pakistan have no connection to or dependence upon a foreign power, they are still under the\nphysical control of the Pakistani government.  Applicant\u2019s record of successful employment, the fact\nthat Pakistan and the U.S. enjoy a good relationship, and Pakistan\u2019s dependence on the U.S. for\nmilitary and economic aid make it unlikely that he would be vulnerable to improper influence by the\ngovernment.  But, Pakistan is rife with terrorist activity.  His family is subject to terrorist actions at\n\nISCR Case No. 03-22643 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2005).\n32\n10\nany time.  And the fact he is a U.S. citizen, if known, would endanger them even more.  The concern\nis that members of his family could be kidnaped by terrorists and threatened with bodily harm or\ndeath if Applicant does not compromise classified information.  The Appeal Board has limited the\napplicability of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. where there is a history of terrorist activity in the foreign country\nin question.  \n32\n \nHowever, as discussed above, in order to apply the second prong of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the\nAppeal Board requires that applicants affirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone\nwould attempt to exploit a foreign relative in the future.  Also, the Appeal Board prohibits any\nconsideration of evidence that is not dispositive of the issue.  Finally, the Appeal Board finds it\nirrelevant to this issue whether an applicant is likely to be improperly influenced by a foreign relative\nor associate.  Applying that standard, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. does not apply.\nUnder the Directive, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. applies where \u201ccontact and correspondence with\nforeign citizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s contact with his siblings has been irregular.\nBut he is the sole source of support for his parents, sending them an average of at least $1,000 per\nmonth.  He calls them once or twice per month.  Applicant is not required to dis-associate himself\nfrom his family.  But being the source of financial support for his parents is not casual and infrequent\ncontact.  Therefore, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. is inapplicable, and the allegations raised under Guideline\nB are found against him.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe concern under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) is that conduct involving questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard sensitive\ninformation.  Applicant gave incorrect answers to questions 15 and 16 on two SF 86 forms in 2003.\nThe government asserts that Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.) applies.  However, Applicant\ndenied that he intentionally falsified the answers by not including most of her delinquent debts.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 15, because he had shown his passport to his security officer,\nwho advised him that his passport was a \u201ctourist passport\u201d and not a \u201cdiplomatic\u201d or \u201cofficial\u201d\npassport, and therefore, his passport was not covered by the definition \u201cissued by a foreign\ngovernment.\u201d  He followed the advice of his security officer.  Because his 2000 travel was for less\nthan 30 days, his security officer advised him that he did not have to list the travel.  He disclosed his\ntravel in detail to both his security officer and the Defense Security Services (DSS) investigator, and\nneither mentioned any need to change his answers.  The only evidence is Applicant\u2019s testimony.  His\nreasons do not seem credible, because a passport is a passport.  He had no independent corroboration\nbut the government provided no documentation of his DSS interview that mat have provided some\nevidence.  Giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt, the evidence does not establish deliberate\nfalsification and I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.3.\n33\nISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2004).\n34\nISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\n35\n11\nWhole Person Analysis\nGuideline E2.2.1. The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a\nperson's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for as security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.  In\nevaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, I considered the following:\nE2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\nE2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nE2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\nE2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;\nE2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\nE2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;\nE2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept\u2013not the potentially disqualifying or mitigating conditions\u2013is the\nheart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.   Indeed, the Appeal\n33\nBoard has repeatedly held that an administrative judge may find in favor of an applicant where no\nspecific mitigating conditions apply.   Of the items above, only E2.2.1.8. appears to be on point, and\n34\nI have discussed this under the terrorist activity section, supra. \nThe Appeal Board suggests that the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative\nto his ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by\nthe facts of a given case.\u201d   In the present case, there is a fair amount of information about positive\n35\nattributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that could weigh in favor of granting him a security\nclearance, in response to the disqualification under Guideline B.  I considered his age (33), his\neducation, the nature of his employment, his reasons for travel to Pakistan, his Air Force service, his\nattempts to surrender his passport, his willingness to renounce his citizenship, and his financial\nstability, as to whether he is a good candidate for a security clearance.  His only trip to Pakistan since\nhe applied for a security clearance was for the death of his wife.  However, the fact that he is the sole\nsource of support for his parents, and that his entire family live in Pakistan and are subject to the\npotential terrorist activity, must outweigh his positive attributes. \nTo conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision.  But this decision should not be construed as an indictment of\n\n12\nApplicant's loyalty and patriotism to the U.S., as those matters are not at issue.  Instead, the clearly-\nconsistent standard requires I resolve any doubt against Applicant, and his close family ties to\nPakistan create doubt about his security suitability.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the\nrecord evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the\nappropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.  While I would like to clear him, in view of the\nAppeal Board\u2019s standards,  I conclude that he has not mitigated the Guideline B concerns, and it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nKris E. Durmer, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 22, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 8,\n2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request\n\n2\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant has raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings that\nApplicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application and deliberately provided false\nstatements to investigators are supported by record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a \nDepartment of Defense contractor as an engineer.  He graduated from a renowned university in 1977\nwith a degree in physics.  He took graduate courses in physics as well, although he left the university\nwithout completing an advanced degree.  \nIn 1994, Applicant was stopped by the police for driving erratically.  Arrested for DWI, he\nfailed to appear for his scheduled court date.  He was subsequently convicted of the offense and\nsentenced to a fine and to loss of his driver\u2019s license.  He was also required to attend an alcohol\neducation program.   \nIn 1996, Applicant was again arrested and convicted of DWI.  On appeal he was granted a\nnew trial and was subsequently acquitted of the offense.\nIn August 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and resisting arrest.  He had\nconsumed wine at a restaurant with a companion and, after he and his companion had left in separate\ncars, was  stopped by the police after making a U-turn.  The resisting arrest charge resulted from his\nhaving pulled away from the officer as he was being handcuffed and from his lying prone in the\npolice car, inhibiting proper transportation to the police station.  This charge was pending at the time\nApplicant completed his security clearance application in 2002.  He was subsequently convicted of\nreckless driving and for resisting arrest.  Applicant was sentenced to pay a fine of $1000 for resisting\narrest and $250 for reckless driving.\n   Question 24 of the security clearance application asked whether Applicant had ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any alcohol or drug offenses.  Applicant listed the DWI incidents in\n1994 and 1996 but did not mention the 2001 charges.  Neither did he mention them in response to\nQuestion 23, which asked about pending criminal charges.  In May 2003, Applicant was interviewed\nby a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent.  He mentioned the 1994 and 1996 DWI incidents, but\nin reference to the 2001 charge, stated only that he had been ticketed for making an illegal U-turn.\nHe denied any other alcohol related charges or convictions.  \nIn August 2004, Applicant was pulled over by the police for failing to stop at a red light.\nDetecting signs of alcohol consumption, the officer performed a field sobriety test on Applicant,\nwhich he failed.  A subsequent breathalyzer test yielded a blood alcohol content of .18.  Applicant\nwas charged with operating under the influence of alcohol (OUI), reckless driving, failure to have\na registration card, failure to observe the red light, speeding, failure to stay in the proper lane, and\nfailure to change his drivers license to his state of residence.  He subsequently pled guilty to OUI.\nHe was sentenced to a fine, revocation of his license, and alcohol education.  He was also fined for\nnot having changed his license.  The other charges were dismissed. \n\n3\nApplicant failed to file federal income tax returns for 2001, 2002, and 2006.  In 2001, he\nattempted to obtain authorization from his ex wife to claim their daughter as a dependent.  When this\nauthorization was not forthcoming, Applicant took no action to file within the allotted period of time.\nHe stated that he failed to file for the other years because he \u201chad a lot of stuff going on . . .didn\u2019t\nmake it a high enough priority . . .\u201d  Decision at 6.   \nConcerning the challenged findings that Applicant\u2019s omissions on the clearance application\nand to the DSS were deliberate, we have considered the wording of the question at issue, Applicant\u2019s\nlevel of education, his explanations for the omissions, and the record as a whole.  We conclude that\nthe Judge\u2019s findings are based upon substantial record evidence.  \nTurning to the second issue on appeal, we have considered the Judge\u2019s decision in light of\nthe record evidence as a whole.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had failed\nto meet his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d\nfor him to have a security clearance.

I make the following findings: Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army for 20 years and retired as a sergeant first class (pay grade E-7) (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A). He held a security clearance for most of his military career, and he received numerous awards and decorations while on active duty. After retiring from the Army, he was employed by a defense contractor as an instructor in geospatial intelligence. He has earned a reputation as an excellent instructor, dedicated worker, and team player (AX D-H). He applied to renew his security clearance in July 2002, and that application is the subject of this decision (Government Exhibit (GX) 1). In July 2004, Applicant was hired as a quality assurance engineer by a defense contractor in the business of creating digital mapping products and software (AX , J, L, and M). This position requires him to have a security clearance. His most recent performance appraisal reflects that he has performed very well in this position (AX K). Applicant comes from a military family. His father, brother, sister, and an uncle served in the military and two nephews are currently serving (Tr. 95).

He is married to a\ncitizen of the Republic of Korea (ROK) who resides with him in the U.S.  His wife\u2019s mother is dead.\nHis wife has had no contact with her father for 23 years.  She has two brothers living in the ROK,\nbut she has not had contact with one of them for ten years.  Her other brother, with whom she talks\nonce or twice a month, owns and operates a taxi in the ROK.  Applicant had only two visits with this\nbrother.  Applicant previously maintained casual and infrequent contacts with two former foreign\nmilitary associates, but has had no contact with them for several years.  Security concerns based on\nforeign influence have been mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended and modified (Directive).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence) of the Directive. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 27, 2005, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2007, and heard on April\n17, 2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He served on active duty in the\nU.S. Army for 20 years and retired as a sergeant first class (pay grade E-7) (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX)\nA).  He held a security clearance for most of his military career, and he received numerous awards\nand decorations while on active duty.  After retiring from the Army, he was employed by a defense\ncontractor as an instructor in geospatial intelligence.  He has earned a reputation as an excellent\ninstructor, dedicated worker, and team player (AX D-H).  He applied to renew his security clearance\nin July 2002, and that application is the subject of this decision (Government Exhibit (GX) 1).\nIn July 2004, Applicant was hired as a quality assurance engineer by a defense contractor in\nthe business of creating digital mapping products and software (AX , J, L, and M).  This position\nrequires him to have a security clearance.  His most recent performance appraisal reflects that he has\nperformed very well in this position (AX K).\nApplicant comes from a military family.  His father, brother, sister, and an uncle served in\nthe military and two nephews are currently serving (Tr. 95).  He has Army friends who are still on\nactive duty and serving in Iraq (Tr. 82).\nAt the time of an interview with a security investigator in October 2002, Applicant was living\nwith a citizen of the Republic of Korea (ROK) who came to the U.S. in 2001.  They met when\nApplicant was stationed in the ROK (Tr. 67).  They were married in May 2005, and she obtained her\n\u201cgreen card\u201d in 2006. His wife intends to become a U.S. citizen as soon as she is eligible. \n\nOn my own motion, I amended SOR \u00b6 1.a to allege that in October 2002 Applicant was cohabiting with a\n1\ncitizen of the Republic of Korea who is now his wife.  I also amended SOR \u00b6 1.b to substitute the word \u201cwife\u2019s\u201d for\n\u201ccohabitant\u2019s\u201d to conform to the evidence (Tr. 82-83).\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request and the documents on which the request was based, are attached to the record\n2\nas Hearing Exhibit (HX) I.  I determined that two enclosures to the request were not proper subjects of administrative\nnotice, and I designated them as GX 2 and 3 (Tr. 36-37).\n4\nApplicant\u2019s wife is not employed outside the home.  She has never been employed by or\nconnected with the ROK Government, nor have any of her friends or family members (Tr. 84-85).\nThe security concern based on her citizenship is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n1\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother died 23 years ago, and his wife has had no contact with her father\nsince her mother\u2019s death (Tr. 66).  His wife has two brothers.  She has been estranged from one\nbrother for ten years and has had no contact with him, but she has telephonic contact once or twice\na month with another brother who owns and operates a taxi in the ROK (Tr. 86).  Applicant visited\nwith this brother twice during business trips to the ROK in 2002 and 2003, but they had limited\ncommunication because of the language barrier (Tr. 61, 68).  He has never met his wife\u2019s other\nbrother (Tr. 61).  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his wife\u2019s brothers are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nApplicant\u2019s wife visited a friend who is a travel agent in the ROK for eight days during\nJanuary 2007 (Tr. 86).  They have telephonic contact about twice a week.\nWhile Applicant was an instructor at an Army school in the U.S., he became acquainted with\na Turkish military officer.  For a while, they had occasional e-mail contact.  Their last contact was\nin 2001, when Applicant contacted the Turkish officer to determine whether his family had survived\nan earthquake in Turkey (Tr. 62).  Applicant\u2019s contacts with the Turkish officer are alleged in SOR\n\u00b6 1.c.\nWhile Applicant was on active duty and serving in the ROK, a soldier in the ROK Army\nserved under his supervision.  They had occasional social contact when Applicant went to the ROK\non business after he retired, but they have had no contact since 2003 (Tr. 61).  Applicant no longer\nknows how to contact his former subordinate (Tr. 68).  His contacts with the ROK soldier are alleged\nin SOR \u00b6 1.d.\n \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of the following adjudicative facts regarding the ROK.   The ROK is a highly\n2\ndeveloped, stable, democratic republic, with a generally good human rights record.  While some\nhuman rights violations have occurred, they have not included mistreatment of suspects, police abuse\nof persons in custody, or torture and coercion of citizens by government officials.  The United States\nmaintains a strong military presence in the ROK, especially along the demilitarized zone between\nthe ROK Korea and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).  While military tension\ncontinues between the ROK and DPRK, they have moved forward on a number of economic\ncooperative projects, which are sometimes at odds with U.S. policy.  Some ROK citizens are critical\nof U.S. policies and military presence.  Anti-U.S. demonstrations are not uncommon.  The DPRK\nhas replaced the U.S. as the ROK\u2019s major trading partner, but the ROK is still the seventh largest\nU.S. trading partner.  The ROK is an active practitioner of industrial espionage, often targeting\nprotected U.S. commercial secrets that have military applications.\n\n5\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n19, 2002).\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to\nclassified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nfor each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \"Substantial evidence\" is\n\"more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\"  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-\n1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3; see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under this guideline is that a security risk may exist when an applicant\u2019s\nimmediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or\nobligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  \u201cThese situations could create\nthe potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when \u201c[a]n immediate family\nmember [spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the\nindividual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign\ncountry.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1.  \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of\naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  \nA disqualifying condition (DC 2) also may arise when an applicant is \u201c[s]haring living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse\nforeign influence or duress exists.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.2.  Where the cohabitant is also an\nimmediate family member under DC 1, both disqualifying conditions may apply.  The totality of an\napplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.\nISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  DC 1 and DC 2 are raised by the evidence\nin this case.\nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically\ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient\nto require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nthe applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the applicant.  See Directive\u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 99-0424,\n2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating\ncondition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nIn cases where an applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of\na foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, a mitigating condition (MC 1)\nmay apply if \u201cthe immediate family members, cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents\nof a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nindividual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE2.A2.1.3.1.\nNotwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1(\u201cagents of a foreign power or in\na position to be exploited\u201d), it requires proof \u201cthat an applicant\u2019s family members, cohabitant, or\nassociates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, and (b) not in a position to be exploited\nby a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved\nand the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); see 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1801(b) (defining \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\n\n7\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Although the ROK historically has been regarded as friendly\nto the U.S., the distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with\ncaution.  Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s wife and her immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power.\nFurthermore, they are not connected to the ROK government or any industrial enterprises likely to\nengage in industrial espionage. The ROK is a close ally and a major trading partner of the U.S., and\nit is dependent on the U.S. for its defense. The nature of the ROK\u2019s government, its human rights\nrecord, and its relationship with the U.S. are not determinative; but they are relevant factors in\ndetermining whether the ROK would risk damaging its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or\nthreatening its private citizens to force a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S.  The ROK police and\ngovernmental officials do not have a reputation for coercing or abusing their citizens to obtain\nsensitive military information or to conduct industrial espionage.\nAny foreign influence on Applicant would be indirect.  It would require that Applicant\u2019s\nbrother-in-law or his wife\u2019s friend in the ROK persuade his wife to attempt to influence him.  For\nthe attempt to be successful, it would be necessary to persuade Applicant to turn his back on his\ncountry, his military friends, and his family.  After considering all the circumstances of this case, I\nconclude MC 1 is established.\nA mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if \u201c[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3.  There is a rebuttable presumption that\ncontacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-\n0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  Applicant has rebutted this presumption with respect to his\nwife\u2019s brothers.\nMC 3 also applies to Applicant\u2019s contacts with the Turkish officer and the ROK soldier.\nAlthough it appears that these two contacts were casual and infrequent from the beginning, they are\nnow nonexistent.  MC 3 applies to these two contacts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the general adjudicative guidelines in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  I have\nconsidered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\n\n8\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.  Although\nseveral of these factors were incorporated in the above discussion of Guideline B, several merit\nadditional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult who served with distinction in the U.S. Army for 20 years.  He\nhas held a security clearance for most of his adult life, without incident.  He remains intensely loyal\nto his military friends and his family members with military connections.  He was sincere, candid,\nand persuasive during his testimony at the hearing.\nUnder the revised adjudicative guidelines implemented by the Department of Defense for\ncases where the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006 (Guidelines), a mitigating condition\nmay be established by showing \u201cthe individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 8(b). While Applicant\u2019s case is not covered by the revised\nguidelines, the strength and depth of Applicant\u2019s devotion to the U.S., his military friends, and his\nfamily members who are serving or have served in the U.S. armed forces  is a relevant consideration\nunder the whole-person concept.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns based on based on foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national interest to continue his security\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B (Foreign Influence):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Clearance is granted.\n\n9\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 1, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n\n2\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 25, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Marc E. Curry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed\na timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDepartment Counsel raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in that he did not consider significant record evidence.\nFinding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found the following: Applicant, a Naval veteran, is facility security officer for a\nstaffing firm that serves clients with security clearances.  Applicant submitted his application for a\nclearance on September 11, 2003.  In October 2003, a police officer observed Applicant engaging\nin a sexual act with another person in front of a urinal in a department store restroom.  The officer\narrested Applicant.  Applicant was charged with indecent exposure and with an additional offense\narising from the sexual act.  He served six months of unsupervised probation, after which the\nindecent exposure charge was nulle prossed and the other dismissed.  \nThis was the only time Applicant engaged in such conduct.  He underwent counseling, both\nby himself and with his domestic partner.  He has informed both his partner and his employer of the\noffense.  \nDepartment Counsel did not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings, adopting them as part of her\nbrief.  However, she argued that the Judge erred in not taking into consideration the fact that, at the\ntime of the offense, Applicant was HIV positive.  She argued that the risks inherent in Applicant\u2019s\nconduct raise serious doubts as to his judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  We do not find\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.  We note first of all that a Judge is presumed to have\nconsidered all evidence in the record.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13,\n2005).  Additionally, we note the following statement from the Conclusions section of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision.  \u201cIn engaging in a sexual act in a public restroom with a stranger, Applicant brazenly\ndisregarded the health risks of such activity, and its potential legal consequences.\u201d  Decision at 5.\nAlthough he did not mention the term \u201cHIV,\u201d the Judge did, obviously, give serious consideration\nto the riskiness of Applicant\u2019s conduct and weighed it as part of his whole person analysis.  Though\nDepartment Counsel may disagree with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, the Board finds no\nreason to conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant submitted an undated answer in\n1\nOctober 2005, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 20 March 2006, and I\nconvened a hearing 8 May 2006. DOHA received the transcript 17 May 2006.\n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw allegation 1.d. to conform with the\nevidence adduced at hearing. Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion (Tr. 208).\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except SOR 2.b. Accordingly, I incorporate those\nadmissions as findings of fact. He is a 48-year-old translator for a defense contractor seeking access\nto classified information.\nApplicant was born in Iraq in 1949. He grew up there and was educated there, obtaining an\nassociate\u2019s degree in textile technology. When he lived in Iraq he made clothes.\nIn 1980, he fled Iraq, fearing for his life because he was a Chaldean Christian. He initially\nwent to Greece, but eventually immigrated to the U.S. through the World Council of Churches in\n1983. He has resided in the U.S. since. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991.\nIn September 1991, Applicant flew to Jordan to meet the woman his parents had arranged\nfor him to marry. She is also a Chaldean Christian. They were married in Jordan in October 1991,\nand she immigrated to the U.S. in March 1992. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February\n1996.\nApplicant has a sister who is a resident citizen of Iraq. He has had no personal contact with\nher since he left Iraq in 1980, and has not spoken to her by telephone since 1991. Applicant also has\ntwo siblings who are citizens of Iraq, but who are legal permanent residents of the U.S., residing in\nthe U.S. Applicant\u2019s wife has two sisters, both citizens of Iraq. One lives in Iraq, the other is a legal\n\n3\npermanent resident of Holland, residing in Holland. She has had no contact with the sister in Iraq\nsince 1991.\nIn November 1992, Applicant was arrested for trafficking drugs in the second degree and\npossession of drugs, both felonies in the state where he was arrested. He was ultimately not charged\nby the county prosecutor.\nThe pertinent circumstances of the arrest are these. Applicant was arrested in November 1992\nwhile driving an automobile rented by his employer from the west coast to the mid-west city where\nApplicant was employed. The employer was arrested at the same time while driving an automobile\nrented by Applicant. The employer had apparently been under surveillance for drug trafficking by\nthe law enforcement officials who made the vehicle stops. Illegal drugs were seized from the\nvehicles.\nApplicant worked as a cashier in the business owned by his employer. He claims that he was\nasked by the employer to fly to the west coast to help bring back clothing to the employer\u2019s business.\nThis is interesting given that the employer\u2019s business was variously described as a liquor store or an\nauto parts store. Applicant had previously made one trip for the employer, and was handsomely\nremunerated for his efforts. Applicant was apparently not charged by the prosecutor after his arrest\nbecause the employer was the focus of the law enforcement investigation. However, discrepancies\nbetween Applicant\u2019s testimony about the circumstances of the transactions, his statement (G.E. 2),\nand the police report (G.E. 5), suggest that Applicant was not as unaware as he claims about his\nemployer\u2019s activities.\nIraq is currently a republican, federal, democratic, and pluralistic government, with power\nshared among the federal and regional governments. The previous government systematically\nrepressed the Shiite Muslim majority and undermined non-Muslim religious groups, but since 2003\nthe government has advocated tolerance for, and acceptance of, religious minorities. Notwithstanding\nthe government\u2019s policies, Iraq remains beseiged by sectarian violence.\nApplicant applied for an industrial clearance in February 2003 (G.E. 1). He answered \u201cno\u201d\nto a question (#21) requiring him to disclose any felony charges or convictions, and a question (#24)\nrequiring him to disclose any drug charges or convictions, both of which required him to disclose\nthe November 1992 arrest. Applicant maintains that he revealed this arrest to the company employee\nwho was assisting him with his clearance application (not the facility security officer). He claims that\nthis employee told him that he did not have to disclose the arrest. Similarly, he asserts that he\ndisclosed this arrest to the investigator who later interviewed him about his clearance, but the\ninvestigator was only interested in Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives. The facility security officer at the\ntime of Applicant\u2019s clearance application testified credibly that applicant\u2019s were instructed to answer\ntheir applications truthfully, and that adverse answers were screened with management to ascertain\nif management wanted to send the application forward for investigation. The investigator who took\nApplicant\u2019s sworn statement (G.E. 3, which contains no reference to the arrest) testified credibly that\nhis job is to record potentially adverse information disclosed by an applicant, and not to pre-screen\nsuch information. Under the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s explanation for his omissions not\ncredible.\n  \nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n4\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a minimal case for disqualification under Guideline B, by\ndemonstrating that he has a sister who is a resident citizen of Iraq, albeit one he has had not contact\nwith since 1991 and has not seen since 1980. The government\u2019s evidence fails to raise security\nconcerns regarding his two siblings who are legal permanent residents of the U.S. (1.b.) or his two\nsisters-in-law, one of whom is a legal permanent resident of Holland, and the other of whom has had\nno contact with the family since 1991 (1.c.)\nThe plain language of the stated concerns and disqualifying factors of Guideline B may (or\nmay not) raise concerns and may (or may not) be disqualifying. This language implies that mere\ncitizenship of, or residence in, a foreign country of an immediate family member does not\nautomatically establish the disqualifying conditions precedent to shift the burden to Applicant to\nmitigate the government\u2019s case. \nIn this case, the evidence establishes that Applicant has had no contact with his one sibling\nliving in Iraq since 1991. Iraq is currently a dangerous place to live, and Applicant generally worries\nabout his sister\u2019s safety. However, a generalized threat to her safety is greatly distinct from the risk\n\nE2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n3\ncharged; E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nE2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts \n4\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\n. . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n5\nthat an entity, governmental or otherwise, would or could exploit her connection to Applicant to\nobtain sensitive information. Thus, I conclude that it is extremely unlikely Applicant can be\npressured based on his sister living in Iraq. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J disqualifying\nconditions 1 and 2,  but Applicant mitigated the security concerns, as regards his November 1992\n3\narrest, which was over 14 years ago and was related to conduct that has not recurred. However,\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his February 2003 clearance application demonstrates his\nwillingness to mislead the government regarding his criminal record. I resolve Guideline J against\nApplicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline E disqualifying\ncondition 2,  and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant provided false answers\n4\non his clearance application in February 2003. Given the testimony of the company facility officer,\nI consider it extremely unlikely that the company would have sent his application forward if it had\nbeen aware of the 1992 drug arrest. Similarly, I consider it extremely unlikely that the investigator\nwould have omitted the drug arrest from Applicant\u2019s sworn statement if Applicant\u2019s had disclosed\nit during the subject interview. Applicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared\npersonnel and suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information\nabout an applicant before making a clearance decision, and relies on applicants to truthfully disclose\nthat adverse information. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\nhimself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other\nsecurity concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage\nassessments and limit the compromise of classified information. I resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

On September 14, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On January 23, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Wilford\nH. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Because Applicant fails to establish error on the part of the Judge,\nthe Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision.\n\n2\nOn appeal, Applicant cites as specific error the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant has no current\nplans to pay a $25,000.00 debt to his ex-wife.  Applicant asserts that the record evidence shows that\na sale of real property currently in progress indicates his intent to address the debt.  Applicant then\nasserts more generally that his plan to pay off or reduce his debts by selling off parcels of real\nproperty are legitimate repayment plans and are therefore mitigating.  Applicant specifically\nreferences one debt in the amount of $177,201.11 (his largest debt) and states that the debt is largely\naccrued interest and can therefore be reduced through negotiations to a much smaller amount.\nApplicant also indicates that his obligation on this particular debt is moral rather than legal since the\nstatute of limitations has past.\nIn this case, the Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant has a history of delinquent\nindebtedness of which he has been aware for at least ten years, he owes 39 different creditors\napproximately $252,675.00, and he has real property assets of a value that exceeds the amount of\nhis indebtedness, but which, until very recently, Applicant did not want to sell.  The Judge concluded\nthat Applicant\u2019s attitude, historically, appeared to be that as long as his assets were more than his\nindebtedness, he was \u201call right.\u201d  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the record evidence.\nIn terms of mitigation, the Judge acknowledged that Applicant recently sold two pieces of\nproperty for a total of $10,000.00, which he applied to an outstanding judgment of approximately\n$20,000.00.  The Judge also noted that Applicant is in the process of selling a third piece of real\nproperty for approximately $40,000.00, which will enable him to pay off the rest of the judgment and\nto eliminate all but his two largest debts.  Nevertheless, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s debts\nand history of past due indebtedness had not been mitigated.  The Judge stated that there was little\nlikelihood that Applicant\u2019s creditors would get paid in the foreseeable future, and Applicant\u2019s recent\nsale of two properties and the expected sale of a third did not rise to the level of a good-faith attempt\nto repay creditors or otherwise resolve the debts.  \nThe Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).\nThe record supports the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F.\nMoreover, the Judge also made formal findings adverse to Applicant under Guidelines E and J of\nthe Directive, and these formal findings provide additional bases for the Judge\u2019s overall unfavorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s adverse findings\nand conclusions under Guidelines E and J.            \n \n          \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is  AFFIRMED.\n\n3\nSigned: Michael Y.

He has no\nvalid, current plans to pay these debts off.  In addition, the Applicant falsified a Government\nquestionnaire concerning his debt situation.  Adverse inference is not overcome.  Clearance is\ndenied.\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 14, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 10, 2005, and November 25,\n2005, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on August 16, 2006, and\nNotices of Hearing were issued on August 25, 2006, and September 19, 2006.\nA hearing was held by video teleconference on October 4, 2006, at which the Government\npresented 14 documentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted\nfour exhibits.  The transcript was received on October 18, 2006. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 66 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to\nobtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the SOR.  The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and\nguideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the\nlive testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial concerns).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant owes at least 39 different creditors approximately\n$252,675.11.   (SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.mm.)   The available documentary evidence confirms\n1\n\n3\nthat all of these debts are in the Applicant\u2019s name.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14 and\n15.)  \nThe Applicant made no argument concerning the validity and/or payment status of the\nfollowing debts: SOR 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.i., 1.r., 1.s., 1.t., 1.u., 1.v., 1.w., 1.x., 1.cc., 1.dd., 1.ee., 1.ff.,\n1.gg., 1.hh., 1.ii., 1.jj., 1.ll.  Accordingly, these specific debts are found to be valid, current\nobligations of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant made specific statements concerning the validity and/or payment status of\nseveral of the debts.  They will be discussed below:\nSOR 1.a. The Applicant has been married four times.  When he was divorced from his second\nwife in 1988, they agreed that he would pay her $40,235.00 in exchange for the second wife\nrelinquishing her rights to real property the two of them owned.  According to the written divorce\nagreement, the Applicant was to pay his second wife $305.00 per month beginning in April 1988.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 13.)  The Applicant testified that he and the second wife had a verbal\nagreement that he would not have to pay her anything as long as he had other outstanding debts from\nthe marriage.  (Transcript at 31-32.)  There is no written confirmation of this alleged agreement.\n(Transcript at 80-81.)  The Applicant did not make any payments and his second wife went to court\nin 1992 to have the divorce decree enforced.  A judgement was entered for the second wife on May\n27, 1992, in the amount of $17,165.71.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 20-26.)  Many attempts were made\nby the second wife\u2019s lawyer to enforce the judgment in the ensuing years.  (Government Exhibit 2\nat 54-66.)  Some money was collected during those years.  By 1999, the last year for which records\nare available, the judgment debt had grown from $17,165.71 to $22,524.93.  (Government Exhibit\n2 at 63.)  In addition to the past due amount, the Applicant still owes his second wife approximately\n$25,000.00 from the original agreement.  Based on the available evidence, I find that this is a valid\ndebt and the Applicant continues to owe a considerable sum to his second wife.  He has no current\nplans to pay this debt.\nSOR 1.b.  This is the Applicant\u2019s largest creditor, a collection agency.  The Applicant owes\nthem at least $177,201.11.  The underlying creditors consist of medical and non-medical entities.\nOver the years, the records indicate that the Applicant has paid approximately $8,000.00 towards this\nindebtedness.  This remains a valid debt of the Applicant.  The Applicant has no current plans to pay\nthis debt.  (Transcript at 35-36; Government Exhibit 15.)\nSOR 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.aa., 1.bb.  The Applicant argues that\nthese particular debts were medical bills run up by his second and third wives, without his\npermission, during their marriages.  The Applicant was married to these women at the time that the\nexpenses were incurred.  He presented no evidence, other than his testimony, that these were not\nvalid debts of his marriages.  (Transcript at 44-45.)  Under the particular facts of this case, his\ntestimony is insufficient to show that these debts are not his valid obligations.  \nSOR 1.e.  The Applicant admits that he has a judgment against him in the amount of\n$15,737.00.  The judgment has grown to $20,000.00.  He further states that $10,000.00 of this\njudgment has been paid when he sold two pieces of land in October and November 2005.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.)  The Applicant submitted an Earnest Money Receipt and Purchase\nAgreement concerning a third piece of property.  He testified that $5,000.00 of the $41,000.00\n\n4\nselling price of that third property will be used to pay this judgment down to $5,000.00.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C.)  The final $5,000.00 will be paid when he sells another piece of his real property.\n(Transcript at 39-40, 45-47.)\nSOR 1.y. and 1.z.  These past due debts were property taxes owed by the Applicant to the\nlocal government.  They were paid off under the terms of his first property sale in October 1995.\n(Transcript at 47-48; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 1.)\nSOR 1.kk.  The Applicant testified that he had made good this past due debt for $186.00,\nrelated to an insufficient fund check.  (Transcript at 50-51, 53.)  \nSOR 1.mm.  The Applicant testified that he had made good this past due debt for $120.00,\nrelated to an insufficient fund check.  (Transcript at 53-55.)\nThe Applicant testified that he would be able to pay all of the debts except those set forth in\nSOR 1.a. and 1.b. out of the $40,000.00 proceeds of his current land sale.  (Transcript at 40-41;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  Excluding those two debts, the Applicant owes approximately $32,753.00.\nHowever, the fact remains that it was a proposed sale and the Applicant has not produced any\nadditional documentation showing that the sale was completed or that the bills were paid. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of his personal\nbackground during the clearance screening process. \nOn April 22, 2002, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated\nthat he had no unpaid judgments within the previous seven years.  (Government Exhibit 1, question\n37.)  This was a false answer because, at that time, the Applicant had two judgments against him.\n(SOR 1.a. and 1.e.)  The Applicant credibly testified that, at the time he filled out the questionnaire,\nhe had a good faith belief that the judgment in SOR 1.a. had been paid and he had no knowledge of\nthe judgment in SOR 1.e.  (Transcript at 20-21, 57-59.)  Subparagraph 2.a. is found for the\nApplicant.\nIn the same questionnaire the Applicant stated that he had not been 180 days delinquent on\nany debts within the previous seven years (question 38); and that he was currently 90 days delinquent\nonly on a medical debt for $25,000.00 as of the date he filled out the questionnaire (question 39).\nThese statements were false answers to material questions pertaining to the Applicant's financial\nsituation at that time.\nWith regards to question 38, the Applicant testified, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the medical bills were out\nthere, but I was referring to debts like utility bills or rent or car payments and this sort of thing.  And\nI had not been delinquent in those.\u201d  (Transcript at 21-22, 59-60.)\nThe Applicant had no real explanation as to why he did not say he was currently 90 days\ndelinquent on debts in 2002.  In his testimony, the Applicant admits that some of his past due debts\nhave existed since 1993, and that he had knowledge of them.  (Transcript at 61-63.)\n\n5\nThe Applicant\u2019s explanations for falsifying questions 38 and 39 of the questionnaire are\nrejected.  His debt situation is extensive, and of long standing.  The Applicant knew, or should have\nknown, about at least some of these debts.  The explanations he attempted to make about why he did\nnot answer the questions truthfully are not credible.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline G - Alcohol abuse).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants to excess.\nThe Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol in May 2004.  He\nplead guilty to a reduced charge of Reckless Driving and received a sentence including suspended\njail time, a fine, one year probation and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 30 days.  From all\nindications, this was a solitary incident which occurred because of unique events that were occurring\nin the Applicant\u2019s life.  The Applicant takes responsibility for this incident and credibly testified that\nhe had not engaged in this conduct previously and would not do so in the future. (Transcript at 22-24,\n75-78.)\nParagraph 4 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\nAs found above, the Applicant knowingly and willfully provided false material information\nto DoD during the clearance screening process.  In so doing the Applicant violated the felony\ncriminal provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001.\nThe arrest and conviction set forth under paragraph 3, above, will be considered under this\nparagraph as well.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na.\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n\n6\nb.\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\nc.\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.\nThe voluntariness of participation\nf.\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\ng.\nThe motivation for the conduct\nh.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may have past due indebtedness and be involved in acts of falsification of\nGovernment forms, alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting or continued\n\n7\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the\nApplicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to\novercome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of\npersuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a\nsecurity clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has over $200,000.00 in past due debts that he cannot, or will not, pay (Guideline F);\nthat he intentionally made false material statements to DoD, in violation of a felony criminal statute\n(Guidelines E and J); and that he has one alcohol related arrest (Guidelines G and J).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him, except\nin part:\nUnder Paragraph 1 (Guideline F), subparagraphs 1.e., 1.y., 1.z., 1.kk. and 1.mm. are found\nfor the Applicant as he has paid, or is paying, those specific debts.  \nSubparagraph 2.a. under Paragraph 2 (Guideline E) is found for the Applicant as I have\ndetermined that the falsification in this subparagraph was not willful.  \nFinally, Paragraph 3 (Guideline G) and subparagraph 4.a. under Paragraph 4 (Guideline J)\nare found for the Applicant.  Alcohol Abuse Disqualifying Condition E2.A7.1.2.1. applies to this\nincident as it was alcohol-related.  However, there is no evidence indicating that this incident is part\nof a pattern.  (Alcohol Abuse Mitigating Condition E2.A7.1.3.1.)  The circumstances relating to the\narrest were unique and, in my opinion, the activity was aberrational on the part of the Applicant and\nnot likely to be repeated.  (General Factors b. and i.)\nThe Applicant has an extensive history of past due indebtedness.  It is obvious that he has\nhad knowledge of the majority of his debt problems for more than ten years.  His attitude appears\nto be that, as long as his assets were more than his indebtedness, he was all right.  He further\ntestified, \u201c[As] long as they [the creditors] weren\u2019t complaining, I was only going to pay what I\nabsolutely had to pay to get through from one payday to the next.  I would apply what I could.  I\ndidn\u2019t want to sell the assets [real property] if I didn\u2019t have to.  (Transcript at 83-84.)  The end result\nof this attitude was that hardly any of his creditors got paid, and there is little likelihood of their\ngetting paid in the foreseeable future.  Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. apply\nto this case as there is \u201cA history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and an \u201cInability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d  \nNone of the Mitigating Conditions apply to this case.  The behavior is recent, indeed\ncontinuing.  It is not an isolated incident nor, in my opinion, were the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior beyond the Applicant\u2019s control.  The recent sale of two pieces of property, and the expected\nsale of a third, does not arise to the level of a good faith attempt to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.  Except as set forth above, Paragraph 1 and its subparagraphs are found\nagainst the Applicant.  \n\n8\nThe Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is\na negative factor for security clearance purposes where an Applicant has deliberately provided false\ninformation about material aspects of his or her personal background.  Disqualifying Condition\nE2.A5.1.2.2. applies to the facts of this case (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities).  None of the Mitigating Conditions apply.

McCoy, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 13, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On August 31, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.\nMatchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant submitted a timely appeal\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge did not give appropriate\nweight to evidence of Applicant\u2019s recent moderate use of alcohol; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings of fact: Applicant began to drink alcohol\nupon entering the U.S. Navy in 1982.  From that date until 1991, Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption\nincreased from infrequent to about three times a week, three to four beers at a time.  In 1991\nApplicant was assigned submarine duty and increased his drinking frequency up to 12 beers a day.\nIn order to save his marriage, Applicant sought treatment.  He was diagnosed as alcohol-dependent,\ncompleted a 30 day program and returned to duty.  Remaining abstinent for 16 months, Applicant\neventually began consuming beer once again.\nBy 1996, Applicant was again drinking as many as 12 beers a day.  During Applicant\u2019s\nhospitalization for possible emotional problems, a clinical psychologist diagnosed him as suffering\nfrom alcohol dependence.  In response to this diagnosis, Applicant abstained from alcohol and\nattended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) twice a week, according to his own statement to his\npsychologist.  Applicant was placed in an alcohol treatment program, receiving inpatient\nrehabilitation treatment at a military facility, which emphasized relapse prevention.  While in\ntreatment he attended AA at least seven times a week.  Upon discharge, Applicant was recommended\nto attend at least five AA meetings a week, to abstain from alcohol, obtain an AA sponsor, and seek\nhelp for any personal or family problems that might impede his recovery.\nNavy officials subsequently advised Applicant that, to remain on active duty with the Navy,\nhe would be required to participate in an \u201caftercare\u201d regimen.  Applicant attended AA and was\nabstinent for about six to eight months, but relapsed \u201cby choice.\u201d  \u201cBy December 1997, he was\ndrinking three or four 12-ounce beers per day . . .\u201d\nIn 2001, the Defense Security Service (DSS) interviewed Applicant.  He admitted to the\ninterviewer that he was drinking, despite being directed by his command to abstain.  He admitted\nto drinking one or two beers twice weekly and a glass of wine occasionally.  \nApplicant retired from the Navy in 2002.  He obtained a job with a federal contractor,\nperforming duties similar to those he did in the Navy.  In 2003, Applicant was re-interviewed by a\nDSS agent.  He told the agent that his current drinking pattern of three or four beers per day was not\na problem and that he expected to continue drinking at that level.\nIn 2004, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted that he was still drinking,\nat the reduced level of one or two drinks a week.  In December 2004, Applicant was evaluated, at\nDOHA\u2019s request, by a counselor at a military alcohol rehabilitation program.  The counselor\nconcluded that, assuming Applicant\u2019s information as to his reduced drinking levels was accurate,\nApplicant did not have a recent problem with alcohol abuse.  Applicant states that he has not been\ndrunk since some time in 2004, although he admitted that he consumed one and one-half beers the\nnight prior to the hearing.  Additionally, about a month before the hearing, he consumed four to six\n\n3\nbeers while working in his yard.  The Judge stated that, \u201cHe intends to continue to consume alcohol\nin the future despite concerns of his ex-spouse and mother that he is drinking too much.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drinking has not affected his work performance.\nAn examination of the Judge\u2019s findings, as well as her analysis, demonstrates that she\nconsidered the fact that Applicant\u2019s recent alcohol consumption has been moderate, characterizing\nit as \u201ca positive change in his behavior.\u201d  Decision at 7.  However, she also pointed out that even this\nreduced consumption is against clinical advice, which undermines the \u201cameliorative impact\u201d of the\nvarious treatment programs he underwent.  Id.  We find no error in the manner in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 03-16167 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 22, 2006).  Given the\nJudge\u2019s findings, we conclude that her decision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\nSee ISCR Case No. 00-0382 (App. Bd.

Clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nTr. 6.\n2\nApplicant originally also denied 1.a, 1.d, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.bb. During her testimony, she admitted them. \n3\nTr. 110-112.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 20, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR alleged facts which raise a\n1\nsecurity concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant answered the SOR on July\n11, 2005, and requested an administrative decision in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel then\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material on October 20, 2005. In response, Applicant, on August 5,\n2005, requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 6, 2006. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nSeptember 27, 2006, scheduling it for October 30, 2006.\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, I received nine government exhibits,\none Applicant exhibit, and the testimony of Applicant. DOHA received the transcript on November\n16, 2006.\nRULING ON PROCEDURE\nOn August 30, 2006, department counsel filed a motion to amend the SOR by revising\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.q, and 1.r through 1.t, and adding\nsubparagraphs 1.aa through 1.bb. She provided a copy of the motion to Applicant who received it\nin advance of the hearing.  At the hearing, Applicant did not object to the motion, and I granted it.\n2\nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted all of the amended allegations except subparagraph 1.f.3\nAt the close of the hearing, I left the record open through November 13, 2006, and ordered\ndepartment counsel to redraft the SOR to incorporate both the aforementioned amended\nsubparagraphs, and the ones that were not amended (1.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.u through\n1.z). Department counsel submitted a consolidated SOR on November 3, 2006.4\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old, single woman with one child, age 13.

Applicant accepted the proposal. At her\n6\nfriend\u2019s instruction, she wrote a check for $5,000 to an individual whom she was told would deposit\nthe money on her behalf.  She had never met this individual prior to writing the check, and the\n7\namount of the check represented all of her severance pay.8\nApplicant received neither the $20,000 of anticipated profit, nor a return of her original\ninvestment capital. She never sought legal recourse against the person to whom she paid the money.9\nDuring this same period of unemployment, Applicant opened a credit card account with a\nhigh-end department store.  It grew delinquent shortly thereafter.\n10\n11\nApplicant experienced successive periods of unemployment in October 2000, and from July\n2001 through March 2002.  During these periods, she opened six additional credit card accounts.\n12\n13\nOne was for another high-end department store.  All grew delinquent.\n14\nBy October 2005, Applicant was delinquent on 20 additional accounts.  Currently, her total\n15\ndelinquent indebtedness equals approximately $25,000. One of them, owed to a property\nmanagement company in the amount of $1,155, resulted in a judgment entered against her in 2004.16\nIn the summer of 2005, Applicant retained a credit repair agency to help her with her\nfinances.  According to their agreement, it was supposed to help her reduce her indebtedness by\n17\nnegotiating with her creditors. No record evidence exists with respect to whether the credit repair\n\nId.\n18\nTr. 20, 25, and 71, respectively.\n19\nTr. 61.\n20\nTr. 86.\n21\nTr. 66.\n22\n4\nagency was to provide financial counseling to Applicant. Nevertheless, any services it provided were\ninconsequential because it went out of business shortly after she retained it.18\nCurrently, Applicant  plans to pay the debts listed in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.s, and 1.p after she\nresearches them to ascertain the exact amount owed.  Also, she asserts that she paid the debts listed\n19\nin subparagraphs 1.b, 1.I, and 1.v, but provided no evidence at the hearing.  Similarly, she provided\nno evidence detailing the outcome of her dispute with the creditor listed in subparagraph 1.f.  She\n20\npromised to begin paying the remainder of the delinquencies in the week following the hearing, after\nshe receives an anticipated $3,000 loan from her cousin.21\nIn approximately May 2006, Applicant developed a payment plan in which she was to begin\nsatisfying her debt as soon as she received a loan from a friend. She abandoned the plan after the\nloan did not materialize.  \n22\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible rules of law.\nInstead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in\nconjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2.,\nEnclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and\nimpartial common sense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n23\n5\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n23\nthat are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government,\nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s loyalty is not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865\nspecifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nOver the years, Applicant accrued significant delinquent debts that she has yet to start\nresolving. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (A history of not\nmeeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A5.1.2.3. (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\napply.\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions, and conclude none apply. She has been\nexperiencing financial problems since 1999. Therefore, they are neither remote nor isolated.\nMoreover, her contention that they were caused by successive periods of unemployment has little\n\nISCR Case No. 01-03055 at 2 (App. Bd. March 21, 2002).\n24\n6\nprobative value in light of her decision to invest all of her severance pay in a questionable investment\nscheme, and open two high-end credit card accounts while unemployed.\nHer promise to begin paying creditors after the hearing when she received a loan was\nsimilarly not dispositive, because a similar payment plan failed six months ago when an anticipated\nloan did not materialize. Moreover, \u201c[a] promise to take action in the future, however sincere, is not\na substitute for evidence that Applicant is taking timely, concrete steps to address delinquent\ndebts.\u201d  Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\n24\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s 1999 decision, while unemployed, to give her severance pay to an individual\nwhom she had never met, with the expectation that the individual would invest it on her behalf, was\nludicrous.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred approximately $20,000 in delinquent debt as a result of a 2003 divorce\nand a medical emergency for her daughter. She provided documentation concerning her payments\nin her repayment plan to her creditors, and thus mitigated the security concerns raised under the\nfinancial considerations guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nApplicant waived the 15 day notice.\n2\nGE (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated May 18, 2004).\n3\nId.\n4\nTr. 23.\n5\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on   and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 22, 2007. I scheduled a\nhearing for November 29, 2007.2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on November 29, 2007, via video-teleconference,\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Government exhibits (GE 1-10) were admitted. Applicant exhibits (AE) A-L\nwere entered into the record without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant and two\nwitnesses as reflected in the hearing transcript. The transcript (Tr.)was received on December 10,\n2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  allegations in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, in her SOR\nresponse under Guideline F. The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. She denied the\nother allegations because the debts were paid. After a complete review of the evidence in the record\nand upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She received her GED in 1981.\nShe is divorced with three children. She has worked for her current employer since 2004.  On May\n3\n18, 2004, she completed her security clearance (SF 86) application.4\nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s daughter needed her help when she became pregnant and then ill and\ncould not work. Applicant sent her money for food and rent.  In that same year Applicant was\n5\ndivorced. Applicant\u2019s sons live at home and she was supporting them. As a result of the divorce, she\nwas entitled to $1,200 monthly child support but her ex-husband stopped paying. Applicant was\n\nTr. 25.\n6\nThe last payment is due December 13, 2007. Thus, as this decision is issued, the account will be paid in full.\n7\n3\nearning a low hourly wage at that time. She consulted an attorney about going to court to enforce the\nchild support order but did not have sufficient money to pay for the legal services and court costs.6\nApplicant\u2019s debts in the SOR total approximately $20,000. There are numerous delinquent\nconsumer accounts from the period 2004 after the divorce. Applicant maintains that she was paying\nall her creditors in a timely manner until she lost some of the child support income. She did not wish\nto file bankruptcy. She paid some of her children\u2019s medical bills but was not able to pay all of them.\nShe had difficulty paying all her debts due to her lowered income after the divorce. When her\ndaughter became pregnant and needed Applicant\u2019s help financially, Applicant helped her daughter.\nApplicant has paid several debts listed in the SOR and is on a structured repayment plan on\nthe other debts with the exception of two. Two of those in repayment will end in December 2007.\nShe is currently working to establish a repayment plan for the last two bills. This should begin in\nJanuary 2008.\nShe earns approximately $1,860 net per month. Her net remainder after expenses and all debt\nrepayment is approximately $300 a month. She is current on her automobile payment. Her children\ndo not live at home any more. She is in a stable position with her job and the government contractor.\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nType of Account/Amount\nStatus\nEvidence\n1.a\nCollection account                  $106\nDisputed/Paid\nAE B\n1.b\nCollection account\n $385\nRepayment $50 mo\nAE C \n7\n1.c\nCollection account                $1,262\nPaid\nAE D \n1.d\nCollection account                  $494\nPaid\nAE E\n1.e\nCollection account     $5,811\nNot paid\nTr.42\n1.f\nCollection account      $1,000\nRepayment $100 mo\nAE F\n1.g\nCollection account       $1,665\nNot Paid\nAE A.\n1.h\nCredit account\n $9,257\nRepayment\n$100\nAE G and H\nApplicant supervisor praises her as an excellent employee who has a good work ethic.

She has known her for\n8\nabout five years. Applicant\u2019s attendance is good and she has great attention to detail.  \n9\nApplicant\u2019s co-worker, who is an administrator in Human Resources, works closely with\nApplicant. She had nothing but praise for Applicant and would trust her fully with classified\ninformation.10\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n11\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n12\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n13\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n14\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n18\nAG \u00b6 18.\n19\n5\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.15\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n16\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n17\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n18\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.19\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $20,000. She admits there are still some outstanding debts.\nHer 2005 and 2007 credit report confirm her alleged debts. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does apply because\nApplicant\u2019s four debts are in a repayment plan. Several are paid and the delinquency occurred due to\nher divorce in 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s debt occurred as stated above due to an event beyond her control. Her divorce and\nthen the medical emergency for her daughter was in the same year (2003). She paid her bills as best\n\n6\nas she could. Thus, there is evidence to support the FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances).\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem/and or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or under control) applies in this case. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) also applies. FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the\ncause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) applies as well. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling but developed a structured plan to resolve these\ndebts. Although there are still two debts that are not paid, there are clear indications that the financial\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\nShe documented her payment plan and has reduced her debts. She now has a stable, good\nincome. She has a solid plan and the determination to resolve her debts. \nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Applicant has a very good work history and excellent recommendations from\nher supervisor. She had three children to support after her divorce in 2003. Despite a low paying job,\nshe managed. When her daughter had an emergency medical condition, Applicant came to her rescue\nfinancially. She had two sons in her home also. The child support was not always received as ordered.\nShe has made good faith efforts to resolve her delinquent debts. Her steady income and her\ndetermination  will allow her to continue to remain solvent. The issue is not whether Applicant is still\nlegally liable for any or all of her outstanding debts, but whether she has presented sufficient evidence\nof extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination.\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. It is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

See Item 2 at 2; Item \n See Directive \u00b6 E2.22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\n4\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual\nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent . . .\u201d \n3\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d  Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding the case in Applicant\u2019s favor, the Judge relied upon Alcohol Consumption\nMitigating Condition (ACMC) 23(b): \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues\nof alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established\na pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d   The Judge\n2\nstated that marriage has impressed upon Applicant the importance of responsible behavior\nconcerning alcohol.  He also noted that there is no record evidence of offenses after the February\n2005 DUI and that Applicant has completed a treatment program and attends Alcoholics\nAnonymous.  \nDepartment Counsel disagrees with the Judge\u2019s decision, arguing that the Judge relies too\nheavily on Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements that he has mended his ways.  We find merit in\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument.  While common sense supports the view that the assumption of\nmarital responsibilities can be conducive to greater maturity, we note the considerable record\nevidence which is unfavorable to Applicant.  First of all is the fact that his most recent DUI incident\noccurred after he had completed an alcohol treatment program, which diminishes the rehabilitative\nforce of such treatment and AA attendance.  Indeed, this last DUI occurred after Applicant had\nsubmitted his security clearance application that is the basis of this adjudication and after he had\nsubmitted a written statement to the Defense Security Service to the effect that his current alcohol\nconsumption \u201cis basically none.\u201d  Furthermore, in this statement Applicant claims that he has\ncommitted himself to sobriety in light of his obligations to his family.  Applicant made such a\nstatement in an effort to obtain a security clearance, which should have impressed upon him the need\nto conform his behavior to the requirements of the law.  His subsequent alcohol-related misconduct\nvitiates his claims that he has demonstrated rehabilitation and increased maturity.   \n3\nThe Board has examined the record as a whole and concludes that, while the Government\nhas established a disqualifying condition under Guideline G,  Applicant has not met his burden of\n4\npersuasion that he has a \u201ctangible track record\u201d of responsible use of alcohol.  See ISCR Case No.\n94-0964 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996).   This is especially true in light of Applicant\u2019s having requested an\nadministrative determination, which deprived the Judge of an opportunity to evaluate the credibility\n\n4\nof his statements in the context of the hearing.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision\nunder Guideline G is not sustainable on this record.  \nWe have considered the issues which Applicant raised in his cross-appeal.  He argues that\nthe SOR improperly listed an offense twice, creating the impression that Applicant had committed\nmore alcohol-related misconduct than he contends is actually the case and that the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings reflect this same error.  We have considered Applicant\u2019s brief in light of the Judge\u2019s\nfindings and the record.  We conclude that any error in the Judge\u2019s findings did not result in harm\nto Applicant, in light of the fact that the Judge decided in his favor on all allegations.  Furthermore,\nwe have taken Applicant\u2019s arguments into account in evaluating the appellate issues raised by\nDepartment Counsel.  Even if the SOR did multiply one offense into two allegations, the record still\ndoes not support a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation or\nextenuation.  Therefore, we find no reason to remand the decision to the Judge. \n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin          \nJean E.

On his 2004\nsecurity clearance application, he failed to report a long period of part-time self employment\nthat paralleled his full-time main position with a defense contractor.  This activity continued\nfor some 30 years and was known by friends and colleagues.

It is not clear his outside activities were of a nature that violates\nGuidelines E and L restrictions.  Mitigation has been established.

The SOR, as\namended, contains nine (9) allegations under Guideline K (Deliberate or Negligent Failure\nto Comply with Rules and Regulations); five (5) allegations under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct); and three (3) allegations under Guideline L (Outside Business Conflict of Interest.\nApplicant admits all allegations under Guideline K, all with explanations.  He denies all\nGuideline E and L allegations.  All specific admissions are accepted and incorporated herein\nas Findings of Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, including testimony and all exhibits, I\nmake the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline K (Deliberate or Intentional Failure to comply with Rules and\nRegulations for Protecting Classified or other Sensitive Information)\nApplicant\u2019s employer is a major defense contractor and provides periodic security\ntraining and material to all of its employees working with classified material, including\nApplicant, who has been with the company for about 40 years (GX 1 and Tr at 52-56).  The\ncompany\u2019s Facility Security Officer, who had examined the comprehensive file on Applicant\ndiscussed his history of security violations in considerable detail (Tr at 64-73). \nApplicant has a long history of failing to adequately protect classified material, in each\ncase violating one or more provisions of the version of the National Industrial Security\nProgram Operating Manual (NISPOM) applicable at the time.\n1.a.  On or about September 28, 1984, Applicant did not intentionally or negligently\nfail to properly secure a DoD security container, in violation of paragraph 14.a.(3) of the\nNISPOM, dated March 1984.\n1.b.  On or about June 18, 1985, Applicant did not intentionaly or negligently fail to\nproperly secure a DoD security container, in violation of paragraph 14.a.(3) of the NISPOM,\ndated March 1984.  His container privileges were suspended for one year. \nAs to both allegations, it was subsequently discovered by the company locksmith that\nthe lock in question was defective and could be opened by a hard \u201cyank,\u201d even if properly\nclosed and turned.  As result culpability on Applicant\u2019s part could not be established. \n1.c. In about February 1986, Applicant failed to obtain a receipt for a classified\ndocument he had loaned to a co-worker and could not account for its location, in violation\nof paragraphs 12.a., 12.b., and 12.c. of the NISPOM, dated March 1984.\n\n1.d. Between April 1997 and October 1997, Applicant failed to comply with approved\nAIS (Automated Information Systems) audit requirements at his company, in violation of\nparagraphs 8-102.b.(9) and 8-303 of the NISPOM, dated January 1995.\n1.e. Between November 1997 and December 1997, Applicant failed to comply with\nAIS approved audit requirements at his company, in violation of paragraphs 8-102.b.(9) and\n8-303 of the NISPOM, dated January 1995.\n1.f.  On or about November 28, 2001, Applicant failed to properly secure the H-2\nProtected Area at his company, in violation of paragraph 5-207 of the NISPOM, dated\nJanuary 1995, and his company\u2019s written policy regarding \u201cClosed Area Security\nProcedures.\u201d  He was verbally counseled by his supervisor.     \n1.g.  On or about December 5, 2001, Applicant failed to properly secure the H-2\nProtected Area at his company, in violation of paragraph 5-207 of the NISPOM, dated\nJanuary 1995, and his company\u2019s written policy regarding \u201cClosed Area Security\nProcedures.\u201d  He was verbally counseled by his supervisor.     \n1.h.  On or about May 2, 2002, Applicant failed to properly secure the H-2 Protected\nArea at his company, in violation of paragraph 5-207 of the NISPOM, dated January 1995,\nand his company\u2019s written policy regarding \u201cClosed Area Security Procedures.\u201d  He was\nverbally counseled by his supervisor.    \n1.i.  On or about September 17, 2002, Applicant failed to properly secure the H-2\nProtected Area  at his company, in violation of paragraph 5-207 of the NISPOM, dated\nJanuary 1995, and his company\u2019s written policy regarding \u201cClosed Area Security\nProcedures.\u201d  He was verbally counseled by his supervisor.     \n1.j.  On or about December 7, 2002, Applicant failed to secure a classified container\nat his company, in violation of paragraphs 5-100 and 5-303 of the NISPOM, dated January\n1995.\n1.k.  On or about April 17, 2003, Applicant transferred a classified document onto an\nunclassified server, in violation of paragraphs 5-100 and 8.501.c.(3) of the NISPOM, dated\nJanuary 1995, as amended May 1, 2000.  He was verbally counseled by his supervisor and\nwas given a five-day suspension from work without pay.         \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n2.a.(1) - Applicant omitted material facts on a Security Clearance Application (SF 86),\nelectronically submitted on or about February 20, 2004.  In response to Question \u201c6.  List\nyour employment activities, beginning with the present and working back seven years,\u201d and\n \n \n                                                                                     3 \n\n34\nincluding period of self employment. Applicant cited his work for his present employer, but\nfailed to mention his ownership and operation, from 1984 to 2004, as sole proprietor of a\nbusiness that refurbishes vintage aircraft.  He considered the activity to be a not-for-profit\nhobby and not the type of activity required to be reported.  In context, I find his explanation\nto be credible.\n2.b. - Applicant failed to report his ownership of the business cited in 2.a., above, and\nhis business involvement with the two procurement companies cited in 3.a and 3.b., below,\nto his employer. However, Applicant\u2019s outside activity does not appear to have any\nconnection to or with his full time employment and therefore does not come within the scope\nof Company policy, as stated in General Policies and Procedures, Conflicts of Interest and\nStandards of Ethical Conduct and therefor lacks security significance. \n2.c.  Alleges that Applicant failed to provide an amended security clearance\napplication when advised by his present employers personnel that an SF 86 submitted or\nabout February 20, 2004 contained errors.  Applicant denies this allegation and states he does\nnot have any specific recollection of this matter.  A review of the Government\u2019s exhibits does\nnot reveal any document (s) supporting the allegation.  Applicant points out that his SF 86\n(GX 1) is \u201csubstantially complete\u201d and what he did receive was a \u201cReturn Notice\u201d stating\nthat no SF 86 was required since it had been less than 15 years since his clearance was\nissued.  \nHe interpreted this letter to mean that he was not being asked to submit a new SF.  The\nreturn letter relates only to the new Government policy that companies can no longer retain\na copy of an employee\u2019s SF 86.  The company was returning the SF 86 to Applicant with a\nrecommendation that he  retain it in his files for any future use.  The memorandum declines\na request from the Company Facility Security Officer to initiate a new investigation at the\ntime because the clearance was not yet 15 years old.  None of this suggests that Applicant\nhad been asked to submit a new SF 86 because of errors in the previous one.   \nGuideline L (Outside Activities)\n3.a. Applicant has been employed by his present company since 1966. He is currently\na \u201cPrinciple Systems Engineer.\u201d  In addition, since 1973, he has operated as a consulting\nengineer and, since 1984, he has operated a sole proprietorship, as cited in 2.a. (1), above.\n3.b.  From about the early 1990s to at least about 2000, Applicant had business\ncontacts, through his company, cited in 2.a.(1), above, with Company A, which provides\nUnited States out of date manufactured spare parts, or parts made by him, to foreign\ngovernments, including aircraft parts to a foreign Air Force and Navy.  \n\n5\n3.c.  Applicant also has business contacts with another procurement company\n(Company B), to which he was introduced by Company A.  Applicant has also made aircraft\nparts for Company B.   \nApplicant has long been considered capable and an asset to his employer.  As long ago\nas 1981 he was given signature authority in the absence of his Director (AX A).  In 2002 and\n2005, he received Achievement Awards.  He completed a DoD Annual Security Refresher\nin January 2007 (AX B).  He has numerous letters of praise and recommendation from\nassociates and supervisors in 2007 (AX C).  Applicant called four witnesses from work.\nThey all think highly of Applicant and his contribution to the Company and the national\ndefense effort (Tr at 78, 79, 93-98, 100-116, and 122-129).  One witness conformed the long\nhours sometimes worked by Applicant, and others, sometimes \u201c80,120 hours per week\u201d (Tr\nat 80-82, 98, 99), but apparently was not aware of the number and type of security violations\ncommitted by Applicant (Tr at 86, 79, 87). \nAnother witness has worked with Applicant for about 17 years and views Applicant\nas being careful about his handling of classified material (Tr at 118).  On occasion, Applicant\nworked 80-90 hours a week (Tr at 119).  He sometime helped Applicant in the latter\u2019s outside\nactivities involving aircraft parts (Tr at 123-126).  \nPOLICIES \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider\nthe following nine generic factors: (1). The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3).\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have\nconsidered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive\n5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the\nultimate question of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an\nindividual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in\nspecific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific\nallegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the\nGovernment has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons.  \n\n6\nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden\nof persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within\nspecific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive\n5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is a 63-year-old \u201cSenior Principle [Principal?] Systems Engineer\u201d with a\nmajor defense contractor (GX 1).  The Government/s concerns fall under three different but\nsometimes overlapping Guidelines, K, E, and L.  \nAll of the adverse information in the case file comes from either Applicant himself,\nor from Company documents.  Applicant\u2019s detailed explanations come in two forms, the\nlengthy Hearing Memorandum, with  attachments, submitted prior to the hearing, and\nApplicant\u2019s hearing  testimony,  given in response to direct questioning by his counsel and\non cross examination by Department Counsel. I have also considered the closing arguments\nof both sides. \nMy analysis indicated three basic questions: (1) what happened?;  (2) did what\nhappened either violate the cited NISPOM provisions or otherwise constitute unacceptable\nconduct?; and (3) did Applicant provide a explanation convincing enough to overcome the\nadverse impact of the Government\u2019s evidence?.  As to the allegations of NISPOM violations,\nI begin with the premise that the allegations are supported by the Government\u2019 s evidence\nand are entitled to considerable deference unless  and until Applicant shows them to be false\nor inaccurate.\nGuideline K \n1.a. and 1.b. - Base on all of the relevant evidence, I accept the premise that a\ncompany security officer was able to open the approved security container closed and locked\nby Applicant.  A the same time, it appears to be the case that even when the dial was locked\nby clicking and spinning the dial, it sometimes had the propensity to open if \u201cyanked\u201d hard\nenough.  \n\n7\nThe two incidents occurred in September 1984 and June 1985, and Applicant\u2019s\ncontainer privileges were suspended for one year, so that he had to have someone with a\nsecurity clearance access the container for him.  However, a 1988 letter from the then head\nof security states that the company locksmith had confirmed that the lock was  \u201cindeed\ndefective.\u201d  The letter concluded that \u201crecognizing the history of the lock, there may be\nsufficient grounds to expunge the June 1985 violation [the September 1984 incident is not\nmentioned] (AX 21 and Brief at page 3).  On this basis, I conclude that the Government has\nnot met its initial burden of establishing that the two violations actually occurred.\n1.c. - There appears to be no dispute that Applicant did fail to obtain a receipt for a\nclassified document he \u201cloaned \u201c to another company employee in 1986 (GX 10 and Brief\nat page 3).  His explanation is essentially that, when discovered, it was agreed by company\nsecurity that the document was probably still in the plant in the possession of another\nemployee and would likely turn up in the next security audit (Id).  The document was\nsubsequently recovered and returned  to Applicant\u2019s security safe, but the violation had\nalready occurred.  \n1.d. and 1.e. It is undisputed that on two occasions, in 1997 and 1998, Applicant\n\u201cfailed to comply with approved AIS weekly audit\u201d and lost his custodianship of the AIS\n(GX 10 and Brief  at 3).  This establishes the violation as alleged.  The claim that the\nviolation was \u201cirrelevant\u201d since he was not even using the AIS system during this period and\nthat he remained authorized to use classified material is not persuasive.  The violation\noccurred, was viewed seriously enough by his employer to warrant a loss of custodianship.\n1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.i. The fact of the four violations in 2001 and 2002 is not disputed\n(Brief at page 4).  The overall excuse/explanation offered is that because of Applicant\u2019s\n\u201chabitual long  hours, he has been faced with the responsibility of closing the H-2 area and\nproperly logging out\u201d on many occasions, during some of which \u201che was rushed to travel or\nmeet with waiting coworkers of customers (Id.).    \n1.j.  It is undisputed that the violation occurred as alleged in 2002.  The\nexplanation/excuse is that no document or information was shown to have been\ncompromised.  This may or may not be true, but it is also irrelevant.  The incident was\nviewed enough to warrant a verbal warning and then a written disciplinary warning (Id.).  \n1.k.  Applicant transferred a classified document onto an unclassified server in about\nApril 2003.  His explanation is that was transferring a large document that, without his\nknowledge, had within it one page of classified information.  When he caught his error, he\nnotified security and participated in the \u201cremoval process\u201d  He now follows the correct\nprocedure and goes over the disk line item by line item (Brief at page 4).    \n\n8\n1.l.  It is undisputed that Applicant left a classified document outside the security\ncontainer/safe.  The explanation/excuse is that the incident occurred in a secure area, so that\nno one without a security clearance could see it.  This argument misses the point that even\nother individuals with a security clearance but with no need to know are not authorized to see\nthese documents and, in any case, the procedures are intended to protect the document from\nanyone other than Applicant having access to it.  Applicant acknowledges his error and has\nnot repeated it.  \nIn summary, I find that the violations alleged in 1.a. and 1.b. did not occur as alleged,\nbut that the other  allegations, 1.c.-1.l, did occur as alleged.  I have carefully considered each\nof Applicant\u2019s violations individually and collectively.  The purpose of a DOHA evaluation\nis not to punish an Applicant for his past mistakes, but to use his past conduct to make a risk\nanalysis of likely future behavior.  His history of violations is clearly unacceptable.  The\nquestion is whether he has adequately mitigated his past misconduct.  In this regard, I begin\nwith the finding that the violations ended some four years ago.  The next question is whether\nthis period of time can be accepted as indicating a fundamental change in outlook, or is\nsimply a hiatus between offenses.\nThe Concern: Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such\ninformation, and is a serious security concern.\nDisqualifying Conditions: 34.( c)  Loading, drafting, editing, storing, transmitting, or\notherwise handling  classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved\nequipment . . . ; 34.(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or\nother sensitive information; 34.(h) negligent or lax security habits that persist despite\ncounseling by management.  \nMitigating Conditions: 35.(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has\nhappened so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubts on an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.     \nThere is no question that Applicant is a highly intelligent, dedicated, and hard working\nemployee of the defense contractor.  He is well thought of by his employer and coworkers.\nHe stresses that he traditionally worked long hours out of his desire to protect the U.S.\ndefense effort.  His goal was praiseworthy, but his failure to protect classified information\nunder his control is troubling.  I conclude that his errors were not intentional, but the result\nof working too hard, for too long, and with too many classified documents.  \n\n9\nThe real issue is whether he has changed enough for the better since 2003.  The record\nestablishes that Applicant has been able to avoid both repeats of old mistakes and making\nnew ones for some four years.  By his own testimony, and that of others who know him, in\nboth live and documented testimony, Applicant has demonstrated he has finally come to\nunderstand his obligation to protect classified information and has been able to act on that\nrecognition.\n Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nAs to 2.(a)(1) and 2.(a)(2), it has not been established that Applicant believed or had\nreason to believe that his outside activity was a \u201cbusiness\u201d other activity that had to be\nreported to either DoD or to his employer.  As to 2.(a)(3), it has not been established by the\nevidence that an amended SF 86 had been sent to him, or that he was even aware of such a\nrequest.  I conclude that the element of deliberate behavior has not been shown.  Applicant\nhas been candid in explaining why he did what he did, more than three years have elapsed\nsince the last incident.   \nDisqualifying Conditions: None that are established by the record; i.e., that he (2) did\nnot deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify any relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, . . . personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities; \nMitigating Conditions: 2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent,\nand the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily; 3. The\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts. \nBased on my evaluation of the entire record, I conclude that no violations of this\nGuideline occurred. \nWhole Person Concept: the DoD adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines. The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole\nperson concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\n\n10\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider\nthe following factors: 1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 2. The\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; 3. The\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; 4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; 5. The voluntariness of participation; 6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; 7. The motivation for the conduct; 8. The potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and 9. The likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence; \nThe Directive\u2019s whole person concept requires me to consider his ability to safeguard\nclassified material based on the character traits established by his numerous violations over\nmany years.  The fundamental question about his current security eligibility is whether he can\nbe relied upon in the future not to relapse into the lack of attention that caused his old\nproblems.  \nBased on his own statements, I conclude the security problem occurred because he\nwas working too many hours, on too many projects, and looking at too many classified\ndocuments, that he sometimes lost focus on his security responsibilities.  As a result, his\nattention to detail suffered and he becomes inattentive, and sometimes negligent, in his\nhandling of classified documents.  As to his answer to Question 6 on his SF 86, he testified\nthat he did not recall reading the question before answering it with a \u201cNo,\u201d but he does\n\u201cknow that at the time, [he] interpreted that as not applying to [X] Enterprises because [he]\nwas doing it on the kitchen table\u201d (Tr at 186).  He didn\u2019t seek a clarification from anyone.\nAlthough he didn\u2019t mention it on his SF 86, he did reveal his outside practices t to the\nDSS agent during the first interview.   He testified that he never worked on anything he\nthought had a connection with \u201canything of security interest,\u201d but after \u201c(9/11)\u201d he began\nbacking away from working on anything that had a connection  to a foreign country (Tr at\n188).  He doesn\u2019t intend to ever do it again.  In context, I find his explanations to be both\ncredible and mitigating. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n2.a. The first allegation alleges a material falsification of Applicant\u2019s answer to\nQuestion 6 on his February 20, 2004 SF 86. It pertains to Applicant\u2019s failure to mention his\nownership and operation of a business, in which he refurbished vintage aircraft equipment.\nCounsel for Applicant challenges the Government\u2019s contention that reporting the work was\nnot required because it was \u201can avocation,\u201d not \u201cremunerative,\u201d  and which Applicant\npursued  \u201csolely for  the pleasure it gave him\u201d (Brief at page 7). \nApplicant first mentions\nthis operation in his sworn statement of March 4, 2004: \n\n11\nFor the past 20 years I have operated a sole proprietorship by the name of [X]\nEnterprises. As such, I do some consulting on, and upgrades or refurbishing\nof vintage aircraft equipment as well as avionic s technology which is perhaps\n30 years old. I do not advertise and all business is generated by word of mouth\n. . . If I can\u2019t locate a part, I can usually fabricate it myself from a plan or\ndrawing . . . I do not personally  involve myself in anything classified or\nsensitive through my personal business. (GX 3 at page 4)  \nThe issue is Applicant\u2019s state of mind and intent.  By the express language of\nQuestion 11, Applicants are asked to cite all employment during the seven-year period cited,\nto:\nList your employment activities, beginning with the present (#1), all working\nback seven years.  You should list all full-time work, part-time work, and\nperiods of unemployment. \nClearly, the Government is interested in all of Applicant\u2019s work history during the\nentire seven-year period.  It is specifically stated in the SF 86 that there should not be any\ngaps.  By his own statements, Applicant operated X Enterprises for some 30 years, without\napparent problem, during which period in which he received his original clearance and\nperiodic renewals, and underwent periodic security briefings.  If Applicant had chosen to\nreport the other employment, the Government would have had the opportunity to evaluate\nthe information and to decide whether or not there was a problem.  This is the reason for\nasking such questions.  Based on the entire record of conduct over a 30-year-period, I\nconclude that Applicant came to believe he did not have to report the activities; i.e., did not\nact deliberately.  Rather, he appears to have acted carelessly or negligently, a situation that\nended when it was brought to his attention based on his own sworn statement. \n2.b.  alleges that Applicant failed to report his outside business activities to his\nemployer, alleged in 3.a and 3.b., below, as required by specific company rules and\nregulations (GX 5).  Counsel for Applicant argues that no conflict existed and that he was\ntherefore not required to report these activities to his employer.  This argument has merit.\nUnlike the SF 86, which require reporting of all employment, regardless of nature, company\npolicy is specifically aimed at activities considered by the company to constitute conflicts of\ninterest.  This concern is separate from  any security clearance issues. \nSection 5.1 of the Company Manual  discusses the company\u2019s concerns as follows:\n5.1.1. [The company] requires its Directors, employees, consultants, and\nrepresentatives to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of such,\nbetween their obligations to the company and their personal affairs.  No\nDirector, employee, consultant, or consultant engaged by the company should\nhave an interest, position, or relationship with any person, firm, or corporation,\nwith whom the Company does business or competes, if such interest, position,\n\n12\nor relationship would influence, or might be likely to influence the actions of\nsuch individual in the performance of his or her duties.  In conducting\n[Company] business, Directors, employees, consultants, and representatives\nmust be free from any actual or potential influences which could arise from\npersonal considerations or relationships. \n5.1.2. Conflicts of interest may arise in many different situations involving\ncustomers, competitors, suppliers, or current or potential employees, or from\nthe acquisition, disposition, or use of company asset.  Since it is not possible\nto anticipate every situation that might give rise to a Conflict of Interest, good\njudgment must be exercised to analyze each  situation that might compromise\nthese values. \n5.3. Personal Business Interests.\n5.3.1 Although dual employment (including self-employment) does not\nnecessarily constitute a conflict of interest, in all such cases, [the Company]\nconsiders itself the primary employer.  There is no specific statement that an\nemployee report all outside employment [as does the SF 86], only when a\nconflict of interest exists or is foreseen [apparently by the employee] . . . [N]o\nconflict of interest exists . . . in  cases where the secondary employment does\nnot involve a competitor, supplier, or customer.  \nApplicant could probably have avoided the concerns expressed in allegation 2.b., but\nCompany rules do not expressly require Applicant to report the stated business activities in\nwhich he has been involved for several decades.  Consequently, this allegation is found in\nfavor of Applicant.\n2.c. - alleges that Applicant failed to provide an amended security clearance\napplication when advised by Company personnel that an SF 86 transmitted on about February\n20, 2004, contained errors.  He explained that he was not aware he had been asked to submit\nan amended SF 86 (Tr at 144-146) and Response to SOR).  I have not found anything in the\nGovernment\u2019s exhibits that supports this allegation.  Applicant\u2019s SF 86 is dated February 20,\n2004 (GX 1).  Nothing in this document, nor any other,  references any errors or an amended\nSF 86 being asked for.  Consequently, I find in favor of Applicant as to ths allegation.\nGuideline L (Outside Employment) \nBy its language, the Guideline is concerned about \u201ccertain types of outside\nemployment or activities\u201d that are of \u201csecurity concern\u201d because they pose  a \u201cconflict of\ninterest with an individual\u2019s security responsibility and can create an increased risk of\nunauthorized disclosure.\u201d\nApplicants are required to report \u201c(a) any employment or service, whether\ncompensated or volunteer, with:\n(1) the government of a foreign country;\n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity;\n\n13\n(3) a representative of any foreign interests; any foreign , domestic, or international\norganization engaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on\nintelligence, defense, foreign affairs, or protected technology.\u201d\n       3.a., 3.b., and 3.c - Applicant\u2019s outside employment has different impacts and\nrelationships on his responsibilities to his employer and to the Department of Defense.\nApplicant has long possessed a security clearance as an employee of a U.S. defense\ncontractor.  At the same time, he has been maintaining a business as a sole proprietor\nobtaining or making, and providing, aircraft parts supplied directly or indirectly to foreign\nmilitary services.  Applicant acted more out of his interest in aviation than to make money,\nout of his business.  He claims what might be considered a de minimis defense. \nMitigating Condition (MC) (b) is applicable since Applicant has terminated his\noutside business activity, I have considered the long period of such activity against the\nsporadic and small scale of Applicants operation, often working out of his home, and the fact\nthat most parts were for older and obsolescent aircraft.  It is arguable whether the business\nactivity clearly falls within the language and intent of the question being asked.  The\nreasonable thing to do would have been to notify the appropriate security officials and ask\nfor their guidance as to whether any conflict of interest with the Company had occurred, but\nthe record does not suggest that Applicant acted with any intent to deceive or even\nnegligently, when he acted as he did. \nTo summarize, it is puzzling that this 63-year-old professional has had so may\nproblems involving so many security issues, over so long a period of time, and which were\nconsidered to be serious enough by Company officials to result in admonitions and discipline.\nWere it not for the last four years without apparent problems, the negative impact of\nApplicant\u2019s past conduct would lead to a negative conclusion.  His negligent acts and errors\nor judgment constitute a pattern of conduct and that does not inspire confidence in his ability\nto protect the nation\u2019s secrets.  Ultimately, however, I am persuaded by the passage of more\nthan four years without his making any security-related mistakes.  I am impressed by the\nrecommendations of those who have known him at work for many years, and I am impressed\nby his claim that everything changed in 2003 (Tr at 158).  He claims he is now \u201cmeticulous\u201d\nin caring for such documents. \u201c I am almost paranoid about . . . making sure I don\u2019t do\nanything in violation of the rules\u201d (Tr at 162).  The record over the past four years shows that\nhe has in fact taken increased responsibility in protecting classified material without incident\n(Tr at 157-159).    \nI have viewed his response to Question 6 on the SF 86 in context, and I am conclude\nthat this highly intelligent man allowed himself to rationalize that what he was doing was\nappropriate, without really considering the consequences.  The testimony of his friends show\nhim to be a man of integrity who had to learn about the attention to detail needed to take\nproper care of classified information. \n\n14\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive\nare hereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline K (Handling Protected Information)\n \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.              \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nFor the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.              \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph  l.g.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.h.              \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.i.           \nFor the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.j.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.k.           \nFor the Applicant\n           Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFor the Applicant  \nSubparagraph 2.a.(1).           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.b.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.c.           \nFor the Applicant\nGuideline L (Outside Activities)\nFor the Applicant\n          \nSubparagraph 3.a.            \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.            \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 3.c.                \nFor the Applicant\n\n15\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. 15, 20.\n3\nTr. 15, 17.\n4\nTr. 21.\n5\nTr. 22.\n6\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 12, 2003, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86). He\nresigned the SF 86 on April 18, 2006.  On November 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security clearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn January 11, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe Government indicated the case was ready to proceed on March 16, 2007. The case was assigned\nto me on March 19, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 21, 2007, scheduling the\nhearing for April 11, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\nsubmitted 12 exhibits, Exs. 1-12, and one administrative exhibit, Admin. Ex. 1. Applicant did not\nsubmit any exhibits. All of the exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on April 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations under Guideline G, subparagraphs 1.a through\n1.d. He also admitted the factual allegations under Guideline J, subparagraph 2.a. Those admissions\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in\nthe record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old. He graduated from a well-known university in 1980 with a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. In 1980, he joined the Army and retired as a major in\n1996.  He held a security clearance while in the military. As a civilian, he was employed by a defense\n3\ncontractor in 1996, and is still employed there as a senior analyst.  He is now divorced, but he was\n4\nmarried 18 years. He has seven children, aged 17 through 10.5\nApplicant was 18 years old and had started college when he began drinking alcohol.  He\n6\ncontinued drinking during his military career. He consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the\npoint of intoxication, from approximately 1976 to at least August 2006. To date, he continues\n\nTr. 27.\n7\nTr. 64.\n8\nEx. 8 (Substance Abuse Evaluation, dated April 1, 2004).\n9\nTr. 30-32. See also, Ex. 5 (Counseling Group Discharge Summary, dated October 31, 2005).

The night before the hearing, he had an alcoholic drink, which was a combination\nof bourbon and ginger ale.7\nIn October 2003, Applicant\u2019s 12-year-old daughter reported that he had sexually molested\nher on several occasions between January 2000 and December 2000.  On December 5, 2003,\n8\nApplicant was arrested and charged with aggravated sexual battery, a felony. He entered a plea of\nnolo contendere to the reduced charge of assault and battery of a family member. He was ordered\nto complete a substance abuse program and given 18 months\u2019 probation. He denied the allegations.\nHe presented himself for a substance abuse evaluation on April 1, 2004. He  was recommended to\ncomplete an outpatient therapy program consisting of at least 12 sessions of individual therapy and\nto remain abstinent from alcohol during the length of the program.\nAs part of the offer to dismiss the felony charge, he had to attend alcohol counseling. He was\ndiagnosed with Alcohol Abuse.  This diagnosis was made by a licensed clinical social worker,\n9\nworking at a local counseling group. Based on Applicant\u2019s alcohol use history, he met the DSM-IV-\nTR criteria for a diagnosis of Alcohol Abuse.  Applicant was shocked when this assessment was\n10\nmade because he was told that the evaluator was not going to recommend that he attend any alcohol\nabuse counseling.  It was recommended that he attend four months of counseling.  He does not\n11\n12\nbelieve that he abuses alcohol.  In November 2004, he entered into treatment with a counseling\n13\ngroup. He then went to Iraq from June 2004 to the end of August 2004.  He returned to counseling\n14\nfor a short period. Applicant continued to drink during the program, as evidenced by positive\nBreathalyzer tests on January 31, 2005 and February 22, 2005. He did not complete the alcohol\ncounseling program.  He was required to restart the treatment process from the beginning because\n15\nhe failed to meet the graduation criteria of continuous sobriety for four months.\nOn January 20, 2006, Applicant returned home from an eight-month deployment to Iraq. His\nfriend picked him up at the airport and took Applicant to his apartment to stay.

Applicant had about six drinks.  Applicant called his 16-\n17\nyear-old son to pick him up so he could visit his other children at his ex-wife\u2019s house.  Once he got\n18\nto her house, she called the police because she did not want him there. The police asked him for two\npieces of identification and he provided his military and employment identification cards.  When\n19\nasked for his driver\u2019s license, he balked, and was arrested and charged with public intoxication. He\nwas found guilty and fined $25 with court costs of $66. He notified his facility security officer of the\nincident immediately upon return to work.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified at the hearing.  He has known Applicant for 10 years, since\n20\nthey started working in the same company about the same time.  Applicant told him about the\n21\nsexual allegation reported by his daughter.  He sees Applicant on a daily basis at work and they\n22\nsocialize outside of work about once or twice a month.  He believes Applicant is trustworthy and\n23\nreliable and endorses him for a security clearance.24\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n25\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n26\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n27\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n28\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n29\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n30\n6\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n28\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n29\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n30\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nAlcohol Consumption\nAlcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nApplicant visited his ex-wife\u2019s home after consuming at least six alcoholic drinks and was\narrested for not providing police the appropriate identification. Applicant\u2019s arrest after consuming\nalcohol is evidence of an alcohol incident away from work. He was back from eight months in Iraq\nand wanted to celebrate. However, he knew that he would also see his children that day, and\ncontinued to consume alcohol to the point that he was too impaired to drive and had his son pick him\nup. Moreover, Applicant did not have 12 consecutive weeks of abstinence and meetings without\nconsuming alcohol. He never successfully completed his alcohol treatment program that was\nmandated by the court. He has also been diagnosed twice with alcohol abuse. Thus, Alcohol\nConsumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser\nor alcohol dependent), AC DC \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent), AC DC \u00b6 22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program),\nand AC DC \u00b6 22(g) (failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation,\n\n7\ntreatment, or abstinence) apply. I have considered all of the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating\nConditions, and I find that none apply. The Government has established a prima facie case for\ndisqualification under Guideline G. Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s case. Allegations\n1.a through 1.d of the SOR are found against Applicant. \nCriminal Conduct\nCriminal conduct under Guideline J is always a security concern because criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls\ninto question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nApplicant was charged with a felony, a serious crime, for sexually abusing his daughter, but\nthe prosecution allowed him to plead to a lesser included offense. Nevertheless, while the court\nordered him into an alcohol counseling program, he failed to complete that program as indicated\nabove. Thus, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime\nor multiple lesser offenses), CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless\nof whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted), and CC DC \u00b6 31(e)\n(violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program)\napply. I have considered all of the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions, and I find that none\napply. The Government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline J.\nApplicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s case. Allegation 2.a of the SOR is found against\nApplicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nhas had a progressive drinking history since 1976. He has been drinking daily since then, with the\nexception of periods when he was overseas. He did not complete order court-ordered alcohol\ncounseling. While he disagrees with his diagnosis for Alcohol Abuse, professionals made the\ndiagnosis. Based on the evidence of record, it is clearly not consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for\naccess to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

He did not provide any documentation concerning his payment\narrangements in a repayment plan to his creditors. He has not  mitigated the security concerns raised\nunder the financial considerations guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted ten items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s answer with attachments, dated April 2, 2007).\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), October 22, 2004).\n4\nId.\n5\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn April 2, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to have\nhis case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s\nwritten case on September 5, 2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM)\non September 8, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.   Applicant did not submit additional\n2\ninformation by October 8, 2007. The case was assigned to me on November 30, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  allegations in subparagraphs  1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o,\nin his SOR response under Guideline F. The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.

After he graduated from high\nschool, he entered the U.S. Army and served from 1991 until 1998. He is divorced with two children.\nHe has worked for his current employer since August 2002.  On October 22, 2004, he completed his\n4\nsecurity clearance (SF 86) application.5\nApplicant was granted a secret level security clearance in 1993.

As a result he has student loans which he paid on as agreed until 2003. However,\n6\nhis 2007 credit reports list the loans in default.7\nApplicant divorced in 1997 as a result of financial difficulties encountered in the marriage.\nHis military pay could not support his wife and child. He used credit cards for loans and incurred\nmuch debt. He also could not pay on his vehicle loan and the car was eventually repossessed. His\nbrother died during this time and Applicant paid for his funeral and burial. He also began to care for\nhis parents financially.8\nAfter his discharge from the military, Applicant worked as a network administrator for\napproximately two years. He then worked in a variety of positions over the years. Twice he was\nterminated due to downsizing. These circumstances drained his savings and caused late payments\non his bills.   \n9\nApplicant\u2019s debts in the SOR total approximately $50,904. There are numerous delinquent\nconsumer accounts from the period 2002 until the present. In 2003, Applicant entered a credit\ncounseling program, and entered a debt management program on July 8, 2003. However, there is no\nevidence of payments having been made to the debt management company.10\nIn April 2007, Applicant entered another repayment plan and received more financial\nguidance. However, he did not like their business practices and stopped using the program by\nOctober 2007. He claims his student loans are not in default. Applicant plans to enroll in another\ncredit consolidation program to pay off his debts.  \n11\nHe earned approximately $3,900 net per month working a regular schedule in 2003. This\ninformation was not updated. In 2003, he reported a -$37 net remainder for the month.12\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s alleged debts listed in the SOR is as follows:\n\nThis judgment is for child support obligation from 1999.

The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n15\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n16\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n17\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.18\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n19\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n20\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n21\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n22\n6\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.22\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of  $50,904. He admits they are still outstanding debts except\nfor student loans. His 2007 credit report confirms his alleged debts from the SOR. Consequently,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\nApplicant has many outstanding debts and none are in a repayment plan despite his repeated promises\nsince 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s debt  has been with him for several years. His divorce occurred in 1997 and he did\nhave financial difficulties as a result. However, he still has substantial debts and despite his claim that\nhe had a repayment schedule in 2004, he has no record of any payments.  He has not shown that he\nacted responsibly under the circumstances to support the FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances).\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem/and or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or under control) partially applies in this case. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  FC\nMC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the\ndispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) does not apply. \nApplicant has received financial counseling and developed a structured plan to resolve these\ndebts in 2003 and again in 2007. However, he stopped using the credit consolidation. He did not\nsubmit any information on a new plan. He also did not have any documented payments to any of the\nconsolidation companies. The record is devoid of any evidence that Applicant has paid any of the\ndebts. There are no clear indications that the financial problem is being resolved or is under control.\nHis promises to pay in the future do not mitigate his debts. His credit reports reflect inactive payments\nfor several years. He has a stable income. But he does not have a solid plan or the determination to\nresolve his debts despite his many promises to do so. \n\n7\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army. His inability to\nstay on his repayment plan was not explained. He began another plan in April 2007 but decided it was\nnot appropriate by October 2007. He has not  made good faith efforts to resolve his delinquent debts.\nHis steady income and his financial counseling has not resulted in resolution of his debts. He has not\npresented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances to warrant a\nfavorable security determination. Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under\nGuideline F. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b-1.aa:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied.\n\n8\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Judge\u2019s principal complaint about the state of\nthe evidence in his Conclusions section was that Applicant had not produced a more recent written favorable prognosis\nor current information on his use or dependence on controlled substances.  \nThe following passage from the Judge\u2019s Conclusions is instructive: \u201cThe burden is on Applicant to present\n5\npersuasive evidence on his current drug involvement, if any, after his 1998 diagnosis.  He has not done so, and I am not\npersuaded in considering his history that any MC should apply.\u201d\n2\n22, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the record supports the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct under Guidelines H, E, and J had not been\nmitigated; and whether the Judge\u2019s overall security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious , or\ncontrary to law.  The Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Guideline H Mitigating Conditions 1,  3,\n1\n2\nand 4  were not sufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns about his history of drug abuse.\n3\nIn making his argument, Applicant notes that in his Findings of Fact, the Judge stated, \u201cHe\n[Applicant] has not used controlled substances since his religious conversion experience on May 10,\n1998.\u201d  A reading of the Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact reveals that the Judge actually made this finding\ntwice.  Applicant asserts that such a finding is in direct and irreconcilable conflict with the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that \u201c. . . there is no written favorable prognosis or current information on Applicant\u2019s\nuse or dependence on controlled substances.\u201d  On this specific point, Applicant\u2019s argument has\nmerit.\nIn addition to the passage in the Judge\u2019s Conclusions quoted by Applicant, the Judge also\nstated, \u201cThe burden is on Applicant to present persuasive evidence on his current drug involvement,\nif any, after his 1998 diagnosis.\u201d  Given the Judge\u2019s earlier, unequivocal findings that Applicant had\nnot used controlled substances since May 10, 1998, his statement that Applicant had a burden to\ncome forward with evidence of non-involvement with drugs since that date is puzzling.   An\n4\nunqualified finding that Applicant did not use drugs after a certain date necessarily relieves\nApplicant of producing further evidence establishing the same.  The Judge\u2019s comments in his\nConclusions about the lack of evidence do not flow logically from his Findings of Fact and constitute\nerror.   The remaining issue is whether this error impacted on the Judge\u2019s decision not to apply the\nGuideline H Mitigating Conditions.  An overall reading of the Judge\u2019s comments in his Conclusions\nsection convinces the Board that it did.   Inasmuch as error impacting on the application of\n5\nmitigating conditions occurred, remand to the Judge for reconsideration of the applicability of those\nfactors would ordinarily be appropriate.  However, because the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is sustainable on other grounds, remand is unnecessary and the error is deemed harmless.\n\n\u201cOmission of material facts was caused by or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice\n6\nof authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided.\u201d\nSimilarly, in a portion of his brief, Applicant argues that he established a case in mitigation regarding his\n7\nnumerous delinquent and overdue debts.  The underlying circumstance of unresolved delinquent debts was not alleged\nin the SOR and was only relevant because Applicant failed to disclose the debts on his security clearance questionnaire.\n3\nApplicant argues on appeal that the Judge erred by not applying Guideline E Mitigating\nCondition 4  to allegations that he falsified his answers on three security clearance applications \n6\nexecuted in June 1986, August 1986, and 2003.  Applicant argues, in essence, that the mitigating\nfactor should apply because the personnel officer completed the applications and merely handed\nthem to Applicant for his signature and did not provide detailed instructions to him.  The Judge made\nsustainable findings that Applicant never disclosed anything unfavorable about himself during the\nentire time he had a security clearance and completed three security clearance applications,\nnotwithstanding the facts that he had an extensive history of illegal drug use, numerous arrests and\nconvictions, and 13 debts whose delinquent status should have been reported.  The Judge also noted\nthat Applicant claimed he never read, corrected and changed any information on the security\nclearance applications when they were presented to him by his company personnel officer, but\nmerely signed them.  The record evidence indicates that the personnel officer had a standard practice\nof meeting with employees during the initial application process to go over individual questions on\nthe application and to record their responses.  It was also the personnel officer\u2019s standard practice\nfor subsequent applications to ask employees if anything had changed since the previous application.\nThe personnel officer did not specifically recall what she did in the case of Applicant, but testified\nthat she likely followed her standard practice.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to list his arrests, drug use and financial\ndelinquencies were deliberate.  In explaining why he was not applying mitigating factors, the Judge\nstated, \u201cI am not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s attempts to shift the obligation to provide a truthful SCA\nto his company\u2019s personnel officer, and make himself a mere naive signatory.\u201d  On these facts, the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant engaged in deliberate falsifications is sustainable, and he was not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to apply Guideline E Mitigating Condition 4 in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nRegarding the allegations brought under Guideline J, Applicant asserts on appeal that his\ncriminal activity between 1982 and 1998 was mitigated.  Specifically, Applicant contends that,\ninsofar as the criminal involvement with drugs ended in 1998, it is not recent.  However, the\nGuideline J security concerns alleged in the SOR focus exclusively on Applicant\u2019s false statements\non two security clearance applications about, inter alia, his drug involvement.  It does not allege the\nunderlying drug involvement itself.  Because the false statements at issue here were far reaching and\nnumerous and because some were made as recently as 2003, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\nhad not mitigated the Guideline J security concerns is sustainable.  Therefore, Applicant\u2019s argument\ndoes not establish error on the part of the Judge.      \n7\nApplicant cites favorable evidence relating to his employment record, honesty, and\nrehabilitation since 1998  in support of the proposition that he should be granted a security clearance.\nThe Board construes these assertions as an argument that the Judge\u2019s overall decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\n\n4\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.  \n   \n \n          \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

We\n\n\u201cAn immediate family member...is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 \n1\nD2.A2.1.2.1.  \n\u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s)...in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a\n2\nposition to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the\nperson(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E2.A2.1.3.1.\n\u201cContact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E2.A2.1.3.3.\n3\n3\nhave examined the record and agree with Department Counsel that Applicant has visited Iran upon\nthree occasions.  Beyond that, Department Counsel begins her brief with her own statement of facts\ndrawn from the record but without alleging that the Judge\u2019s own findings are insufficient.  The Board\nmay consider whether a Judge\u2019s factual findings are based upon substantial evidence, presuming that\nissue is raised.  Failing that, we rely on the findings as set forth in the decision.  See ISCR Case No.\n03-11765 at 3 (App. Bd. April 11, 2005).  The Judge\u2019s findings, being unchallenged save for the\nexception noted above, are not an issue in the case.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions.\n \nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  \u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance\nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nGiven his findings, the Judge properly concluded that Foreign Influence Disqualifying\nCondition (FIDC) 1  is applicable to this case.  That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to\n1\nApplicant.  \u201cIf there are admitted or proven facts or circumstances that raise security concerns,\u2018[t]he\napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate\nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u2019\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-28838 at\n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 12, 2006); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \nThe Judge found that two mitigating conditions were possibly raised by the facts, Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Conditions (FIMC) 1  and 3 .  In evaluating the former, the Judge observed that\n2\n3\n\u201c[t]he hostility of Iran to the United States places a heavy burden on Applicant to demonstrate that\nthe immediate family members in Iran do not pose a security risk and he is not in a position to be\nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his family members.  With its adversarial\nstance and its dismal human rights record, it is conceivable that Iran would target any citizen in an\nattempt to gather information from the United States.\u201d  The Judge concluded that the evidence\nsupplied by Applicant was insufficient to meet his burden of persuasion as to the second clause of\nFIMC 1.  Regarding the latter mitigating condition, the Judge concluded that Applicant had met his\nburden as regards the oldest brother, insofar as their contact was casual and infrequent, but not as\nto the other, with whom he speaks on a monthly basis.  Having properly declined to apply the\n\n4\nmitigating conditions, therefore, the Judge based his favorable decision upon his whole person\nanalysis.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006).  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis does not sufficiently\naddress the nature of the Iranian regime and the vulnerability of Applicant\u2019s Iranian relatives to\ncoercion by that regime, relying upon Directive  \u00b6  E2.2.1.8 (\u201cpotential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\u201d) for the proposition that it is the only adjudicative factor fully relevant to\nGuideline B cases.  Although a sufficient whole person analysis should take into account a variety\nof matters in addition to the this adjudicative factor (see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd.\nJan. 5, 2007)), we nevertheless find merit in Department Counsel\u2019s argument, considered as a whole.\nThat is, while the Judge properly noted such favorable facts as the 29 years which Applicant has\nlived in the U.S., the U.S. citizenship and residence of his wife and children, and his sincere\nstatement that he would not act contrary to this country despite whatever pressures Iran exerted on\nhis relatives, the Judge does not explain why these factors outweigh the absence of record evidence\nconcerning the brother with whom he maintains regular contact.  \nAs Department Counsel points out, the record is silent as to the nature of his brother\u2019s\nemployment, the extent of the brother\u2019s financial reliance upon the Iranian government, or any other\nfactor which bears upon the question of how visible the brother might be to his country\u2019s\ngovernment.  In addition, the record does not develop in sufficient detail \u201cthe nature and character\nof [Applicant\u2019s] relationship\u201d with the brother, which is relevant in evaluating the whole person.\nISCR Case No. 02-04786 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003). This lack of evidence is especially acute\nin light of the Judge\u2019s own statement that Iran might conceivably target any of its citizens in order\nto gather intelligence against the United States.  Of course, as stated above, Applicant has provided\nhis own assurance that he would not act contrary to the interests of the U.S.  However, the Board has\npreviously held that such statements are of limited weight, given their hypothetical nature.  See ISCR\nCase No. 02-26978 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2005); ISCR Case No. 0-02892 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 28,\n2004).  In light of this, we conclude that the Judge abused his discretion in concluding that Applicant\nhad satisfied his burden of persuasion.     \nThe Judge cites to 50 U.S.C.  \u00a7  438 and 50 U.S.C.  \u00a7  1801.  The Board has clearly explained\nwhy these statutes, which are self-limited to a criminal or espionage context, do not govern the\ninterpretation of the phrase \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d for purposes of FIMC1.  See ISCR Case No.\n04-00540 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \nFinally, the Judge concludes by saying \u201cApplicant is a mature individual with a history of\nservice to this country...Because of Applicant\u2019s long standing...loyalties in the U.S. he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.\u201d  Decision at 6.  The\nJudge\u2019s reference to loyalties in the U.S. is problematic given the clear language of the Executive\nOrder that these proceedings \u201cshall in no sense be a loyalty determination.\u201d  Given the sparse record\nin this case it is difficult to justify the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has a history of service to\nthis country.  Furthermore, Applicant lived here for 24 years before becoming a U.S. citizen.  \n\n5\n Order\nThe judgment of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Greg D. McCormack, Attorney At Law\nDecember 8, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) dated July 13,\n2006.  On July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines B and C\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 12, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on September 16, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 23,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for November 5, 2008.  On September 29, 2008, the\nhearing dated was amended from November 5, 2008, to November 12, 2008.  At the\nhearing the Government presented nine exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 9.  The Applicant presented four exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough D, and testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until November\n19, 2008, to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant\nsubmitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.\nThe official transcript (Tr.) was received on November 24, 2008.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Iran.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 11).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 61 years of age and has a Doctorate\nDegree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed as a Senior Principal Multi-\nDisciplinary Engineer for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a\nway as to show a preference for another country over the United States. \nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  He was born in\nTehran, Iran in 1946, to Iranian parents.  He came to the United States in 1965, at the\nage of nineteen, on a student visa to pursue his studies with the intentions of returning\nto Iran.  While attending college, he met his wife, a native American citizen.  In 1975,\nafter finishing his Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees, he returned with his wife to Iran to\nlive. \nWhile living in Iran, the Applicant was employed for an Iranian company where\nhe held a Top Secret Iranian Clearance.  (Tr. p 76).  He entered the Iranian Army where\nhe served for four years and obtained the rank of First Lieutenant.  On land that the\nApplicant inherited from his father, he built a condominium to live in.  He and his wife\nlived in Iran until 1979, when the revolution occurred, and then moved back to the\nUnited States.  \nThe Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen in 1984, and obtained\nhis doctorate degree.  On February 11, 2004, in a sworn statement to the DoD, he\nstated that he was not willing to relinquish his Iranian passport because he did not know\n\n3\nif he would need to travel to Iran because of his mother or his property.  Furthermore, it\nwould require that he petition the Iranian government and he does not want to bring\nattention to himself in that way.  (Government Exhibit 5 and Tr. pp. 72-73 ).  Presently,\nhe still does not wish to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  (Tr. p. 72). \nAt the hearing, Applicant still possessed an Iranian passport that was issued to\nhim on November 12, 1998, and expired in 2003.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Tr. p. 42).\nHe now indicates that he is willing to surrender it if necessary.  Applicant submitted a\ncopy of a Foreign Passport Disposition Certificate indicating that on November 13,\n2008, he surrendered his foreign passport to his company security department.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).  The Applicant has two children who are native\nborn American citizens.  However, his wife and children are dual citizens of Iran and\nthey all possess Iranian passports.      \nSince becoming a United States citizen, the Applicant has traveled to Iran on\nthree occasions using his Iranian passport.  The first time was in 1996, in honor of his\nfather\u2019s death.  The second time was in 1999, or so to take his wife and children back to\nIran visit his mother and see the countryside.  In 2001, his daughter graduated from\ncollege and he took her back to visit his mother and spend time in Iran.  On each trip the\nApplicant stayed with his mother.  (Tr. p. 68).  \nThe Applicant hopes to someday be able to go back to Iran, to visit, but not under\nthe present regime.  (Tr. p. 47).  In the event of his mother\u2019s death, he will not go back.\n(Tr. p. 49).  He states that he has no intentions of returning to Iran while he maintains a\nsecurity clearance.  The Applicant has worked for his current employer since 2002, and\nholds a Top Secret security clearance.\n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant has a close and continuing relationship with his family in Iran.  His\n95 year old mother, a retired medical doctor, and his sister, a retired University\nprofessor, are citizens and residents of Iran.  His brother, who is two years older than\nthe Applicant and also married to an American citizen, is a resident of Iran.  They\nmoved back to Iran take care of the Applicant\u2019s mother.  The Applicant\u2019s contact with his\nmother has decreased over the years, however he presently telephones her, once every\ntwo months or so to check on her.  He e-mails his brother about once a week or once\nevery two weeks.  (Tr. p. 41).  His father, who was a retired government civil engineer\npassed away in 1991.  \nHis mother receives a pension from the Iranian government for her husband\u2019s\nservice to the country.  His sister also receives a pension from the Iranian government.\nHer husband is a retired Colonel in the Iranian Air Force.  When his mother dies, he\nstands to inherit some assets in Iran.        \n\n4\nThe Applicant owns a condominium in Iran that he and his wife had built on land\nthat he inherited from his father.  The condominium is worth approximately $300,000.00.\nHis mother currently resides either in the condominium or adjacent to it.  For some time,\nthe Applicant has rented out the condominium.  The rents received went directly to his\nbrother for management fees and maintenance costs.  Upon the advice of his attorney,\nhe recently transferred ownership of his property to his two brothers.  He states that he\nis not expecting financial reimbursement for it. (Tr. pp. 53-54).  He currently has no\nfinancial assets in his name in Iran.     \nThe Applicant has significant financial holdings in the United States.  He owns a\nhouse worth approximately $750,000.00 and has equity of approximately $400,000.00.\nHis credit reports show that he pays his bills on time and has good credit.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B).       \nLetters of character reference from professional colleagues, coworkers,\nneighbors, friends and his pastor attest to the Applicant\u2019s honesty, integrity, intelligence\nand strong work ethic.  He is known as a devoted family man, who is a loving and\ncompassionate father and deeply devoted to the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\nApplicant received two achievement awards for outstanding job performance.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Iran.  The\nfact that Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States, Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire\nnuclear weapons and other weapon of mass destruction, its support for and involvement\nin international terrorism, it\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace\nprocess, and it\u2019s dismal human rights records.  I have considered the fact that Iranian\nGovernment officials at all levels commit serious abuses of their power and authority.\nIt\u2019s Totalitarian Government, the fact that Iran supports terrorists activities, and it is\nrampant with crime and instability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Iran,\nthe human rights abuses, and the government corruption elevates the cause for\nconcern in the case.  The United States may face no greater challenge from a single\ncountry than from Iran.    \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\n\n5\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Preference\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n\n6\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\nI.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guidelines C (foreign preference)\nand B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between\nApplicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\n\n7\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign connection may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the\nApplicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to\nthat of another country. The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \n \nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Conditions 10 (a) exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a United States citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member.  None of the mitigating conditions\nare applicable. \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies in this\ncase.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States and specifically\nacknowledges that.  Although his wife and children are native born Americans, they are\nall dual citizens and have Iranian passports to enter and exit Iran as they wish.  The\nApplicant remains close to his mother, sister and brother who are citizens and residents\nof Iran.  He did not want to sell his property in Iran because he knew it would\nemotionally hurt his mother, so he transferred ownership of it to his brothers.  He loves\nand respects his mother and siblings in Iran.  He telephones and e-mails his family in\nIran regularly.  He has a strong bond of affection with his family and deep and abiding\nties in Iran.  He stands to inherit assets in Iran upon the death of his mother.\nFurthermore, after becoming a United States citizen, he exercised his privilege of\nforeign citizenship, by traveling to Iran using his Iranian passport on three separate\noccasions.  He does not want to relinquish his Iranian citizenship.  He has not cut all ties\nfrom Iran.    \n\n8\nIt is noted that the current political situation in Iran elevates the cause for concern\nin this case.  Although there is no direct evidence that his family members in Iran are\nassociated in any way with the Iranian government, there is evidence of a close bond\nand strong evidence of affection with his family in Iran.  This bond and affection with his\nfamily could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, the possibility of foreign\ninfluence exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise\nof classified information.  I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B\n(Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines C and\nB.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant \nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n2.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n2.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n2.c.: Against the Applicant \nSubparas.\n2.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n2.e.: Against the Applicant\n\n9\n DECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

We remand the case to the Administrative Judge.\n1\nII. Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts\n \nThe Judge found that Applicant was born in Jordan but immigrated to the U.S. when he was\n18 years old, eventually earning a degree in electrical engineering.  He became a citizen of the U.S.\nin 1985.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a native-born American.  They have four children and possess no\nfinancial interests outside the U.S.  Applicant and his family have traveled to Jordan three times, in\n1991, 1999, and 2002.  The first two were to visit relatives, the last was a stopover visit on the way\nto a religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.  \nApplicant has held a Jordanian passport, as have all other members of his immediate family\nexcept his youngest child.  Applicant\u2019s passport expired in 2004.  He has expressed a willingness\nto renounce his Jordanian citizenship, although Jordan requires the payment of a $2000 fee per\npassport, which would total $10,000, more than Applicant can afford to pay.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and eight of his nine siblings are citizens and residents of Jordan.  The\nninth sibling is a Jordanian citizen residing in the U.S.  The Judge found that none of Applicant\u2019s\nrelatives are employed by the government of Jordan.  The Judge found that Applicant speaks with\nhis mother once a month but that his contact with his siblings has occurred only during his visits to\nJordan.  \nThe Judge found that Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with excellent relations with the\nUnited States.  He found that Jordan protects the rights of all its citizens.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s finding of facts is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable\nmind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in\nthe record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\nadministrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal\nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative Judge\u2019s finding,\nwe are required to give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2A2.1.2.1.\n2\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.\n3\n3\nExcept as noted below, the Department Counsel has not expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact, although she provides a detailed description of facts drawn from the record, upon\nwhich she states that her appeal brief relies.  The Board may consider whether a Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings are based upon substantial evidence, presuming that issue is raised by the appealing party.\nFailing that, we are bound by the findings as set forth in the decision, insofar as we have no de novo\nfact finding power of our own.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11765, p. 3 (App. Bd. April 11, 2005).  \nWe note that in her discussion of the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis, Department Counsel\ncriticizes the Judge for not considering the fact that terrorist groups operate within Jordan.  We\ninterpret this as a challenge to the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings.  We agree with the Department\nCounsel that the presence of terrorist groups in Jordan is a factor which the Judge should have\nweighed in his analysis, and accordingly we conclude that his facts are in error to the extent that he\nmade no finding on that matter.  Otherwise we conclude that the Judge\u2019s findings are based upon\nsubstantial evidence.\nIII. Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions.\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOur scope of review under this standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that\nof the Administrative Judge. We may not set aside an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision \u201cthat is\nrational, based on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority\ndelegated to the agency ...\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42. We review matters of law de\nnovo.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raises Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition\n(1): \u201cAn immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection\nor obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\u201d  Furthermore, the Judge\n2\nconsidered two Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FIMC): (1) \u201cA determination that the\nimmediate family member(s) . . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be\nexploited by the foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty\nto the person(s) involved and the United States;\u201d  and (2) \u201cContact and correspondence with foreign\n3\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3.\n4\nIn analyzing MC1, the Judge made several problematic statements regarding law and Appeal Board precedent.\n5\nHe based his analysis in part upon the view that the term \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d must be interpreted consistent with\n50 U.S.C. \u00a7  435 et seq.  We have addressed the propriety of this approach in ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 5-6 (App. Bd.\nJanuary 5, 2007).  Another example is \u201c[T]he Appeal Board prohibits any consideration of evidence that is not\ndispositive of the issue.\u201d  This Board places no such limitation on the admission or consideration of evidence, the\nDirective requiring that \u201c[e]ach clearance decision must  be a . . . common sense determination based on consideration\nof all relevant and material information.\u201d \u00b6 6.3.  Compare ISCR Case No. 04-11571 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb 8, 2007).\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2.1.  These factors are (1) the \u201cnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\u201d (2) the\n6\n\u201ccircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\u201d (3) the \u201cfrequency and recency of the\nconduct;\u201d (4) the \u201cindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\u201d (5) the \u201cvoluntariness of participation;\u201d (6)\nthe \u201cpresence of absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\u201d (7) the \u201cmotivation for the conduct;\u201d\n(8) the \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\u201d and (9) the \u201clikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe Department Counsel supplied no exhibits about Jordan, the only such documents in the file having come\n7\nfrom Applicant.  Most of these are from the web site of the Jordanian Embassy, and are filled with laudatory comments\nabout the country.  The only exhibit which bears the imprimatur of the U.S. is a State Department consular information\nsheet.  It is in this exhibit that information about terrorist groups operating in Jordan is to be found.   \n4\ncitizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d   The Judge concluded that neither of these MC s apply.   He\n4\n5\nbased his favorable decision on his whole person analysis.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the whole person analysis is flawed.  Specifically,\nDepartment Counsel states that, of the whole person factors listed in the Directive,  only \u201c[t]he\n6\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d is relevant to Applicant\u2019s case.  Department\nCounsel then argues that this one factor is not sufficient to overcome the security concerns inherent\nin Applicant\u2019s family relationships.  Furthermore, Department Counsel takes the Administrative\nJudge to task for not considering the extent to which Applicant\u2019s family, rather than simply\nApplicant himself, would be subject to pressure, coercion, etc.  \nThe Board does not agree with Department Counsel that the factors listed in E2.2.1 are the\nonly ones that may be considered in performing a whole person analysis in a Guideline B case.\nOther matters, such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the nature and extent of an\napplicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within\nthe U.S., and many others raised by the facts of a given case can properly be factored in to a judge\u2019s\nevaluation of an applicant\u2019s worthiness of a security clearance.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00631\nat 4-5 (App. Bd. Sept. 6, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006).  The\nconsideration for the Board on appeal is whether in a given case a judge\u2019s whole person analysis\nsupports his or her final decision.\nThe Judge did perform a whole person analysis, but one in which he focused almost solely\nupon \u00b6  E2.2.1.8.  For reasons stated above, we conclude that the analysis is too narrowly focused.\nAdditionally, it is unreasonably conclusory.  For example, the Judge states that \u201cit is helpful to\nconsider Applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 vulnerability to exploitation by foreign powers in Jordan.\u201d  He goes\non to say that the numerous relatives living in Jordan are indeed vulnerable to exploitation but that\nApplicant, due to his maturity, successful employment, and loyalty to the U.S., is sufficiently\nimmune to exploitation as not to constitute a security risk.  The decision does not really explain why\nit is so.  \n7\n\n5\nWe remand the case to the Judge for a new opinion, one which takes into account the errors\nwhich the Board has identified and one which includes a more detailed whole person analysis, an\nanalysis which takes into account record evidence about dangers existing in Jordan insofar as they\nhave a bearing upon the potential for coercion.  Also, as appropriate, it should detail and explain\nApplicant\u2019s pertinent qualities, characteristics, and circumstances which are the basis for the Judge\u2019s\nultimate decision.\n     \n Order\nThe judgment of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

After additional findings of facts and conclusions, I again conclude that Applicant\nsuccessfully mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence.)  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 4, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR alleged reasons under\nGuidelines B (foreign influence) and C (foreign preference) why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nIn a written statement dated August 24,  2005, Applicant responded to the allegations in the\nSOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October\n20, 2005, and was reassigned to me on November 7, 2005, due to caseload considerations.  A Notice\nof Hearing was issued November 10, 2005, scheduling the hearing for December 14, 2005.  The\nhearing was held as scheduled.  At the hearing, the government offered six exhibits and Applicant\nsubmitted three exhibits.  Applicant called two witnesses and he testified in his own behalf.  I kept\nthe record open until January 16, 2006.  Applicant submitted Exhibits D-G on January 16, 2006.\nDepartment Counsel offered no objection.  I admitted Exhibits D-G in evidence.  The transcript (Tr.)\nwas received December 28, 2005.\nI issued a decision on June 16, 2006.  Department Counsel appealed my decision.  However,\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s brief and any brief filed by Applicant\u2019s counsel were not included in the file.\nThe Appeal Board issued a decision remanding the case to me on March 5, 2007.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s remand concludes that I committed factual error by not making a finding\nabout the presence of terrorist groups in Jordan, and that I should weigh this fact in my analysis.1\nThe additional facts concerning terrorism in Jordan are at page 5, infra.  The Appeal Board\ndetermined that the facts cited in my decision were supported by substantial evidence.  \n2\n\nId. at 4.\n3\nId.\n4\nId.  at 5.\n5\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C (Amended Answer to Statement of Reasons, dated December 14, 2005) at 1.\n6\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Standard Form 86 (SF 86) Security Clearance Application, dated April 8, 2003) at 1.\n7\nTr. 11 is the source for the information in this and the next two sentences. \n8\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra n. 2, at 2.\n9\nId. at 23-24.\n10\nId. at 45.\n11\n3\nIn regard to my \u201cwhole person analysis\u201d the Appeal Board determined that it was \u201ctoo\nnarrowly focused\u201d and \u201cunreasonably conclusory.\u201d   The Appeal Board suggested that my opinion\n3\naddress \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\nties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S., and\nmany others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d   The Appeal Board in its decretal paragraph\n4\ndirected:\nWe remand the case to the Judge for a new opinion, one which takes into account the\nerrors which the Board has identified and one which includes a more detailed whole\nperson analysis, an analysis which takes into account record evidence about dangers\nexisting in Jordan insofar as they have a bearing upon the potential for coercion.\nAlso, as appropriate, it should detail and explain Applicant\u2019s pertinent qualities,\ncharacteristics, and circumstances which are the basis for the Judge\u2019s ultimate\ndecision.5\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.c., 1.d., and 2.a.   All other\n6\nallegations were denied.  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor.   He immigrated to the U.S.\n7\nfrom Jordan at the age of 18.

Those passports are expired and have not\nbeen renewed.   He renewed his in 1999.  It expired in 2004.   In a DSS interview, he said he was\n19\n20\nwilling to renounce his Jordanian citizenship and that he had no intention of renewing his Jordanian\npassport.   On December 5, 2005, Applicant took the affirmative action of renouncing his Jordanian\n21\ncitizenship.  He mailed a letter stating his renunciation and surrendered his expired passport and sent\nit to the Jordanian Embassy in Washington, DC.

In 2005, Jordanian authorities\nmade a number of arrests of persons charged with plotting to attack Western targets,\nincluding tourists.  Since late 1999, there has been a series of serious, confirmed\nterrorist threats and disrupted terrorist plots targeting U.S. interests in Jordan.  In\nApril 2004, Jordanian authorities disrupted a plan to attack the U.S. Embassy and\nJordanian leadership sites with explosive-laden vehicles.  An American diplomat was\nassassinated in October 2002.  The ongoing violence in Israel, the West Bank, and\nGaza continues to have an impact on the security climate in Jordan.  Pro-Palestinian\ndemonstrations have occurred periodically throughout Jordan since violence between\nIsraelis and Palestinians broke out in September 2000.

He does not speak freely\non a large number of things, as some people do, and he\u2019s been a very good worker for me.  He has\ntaken all of the periodic security courses that we have to make sure that he handles all the\ninformation in a proper and secure fashion.  And to my knowledge, has always been discreet and \n understanding of all the requirements that are put on him.\u201d   He also described Applicant as a\n42\nperson who scrupulously complies with all security requirements.43\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[No] one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d   As Commander-in-Chief, the President has\n44\n\u201cthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether\nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such\ninformation.\u201d   The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United\n45\nStates citizens \u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United\nStates, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as\nwell as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to\nabide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d   Eligibility\n46\nfor a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating\nthe security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the\napplicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that\nthe circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.   The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\n47\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.48\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n49\nId., at 3.\n50\nSee Egan; Directive \u00b6  E2.2.2.\n51\n8\nOnce the Government establishes a its case, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\n49\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d50\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence.  The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest\nin ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or his own.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national\ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the Government.   Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\n51\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, not actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than\nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. \nHaving considered the evidence as a whole, I find the following guidelines most pertinent\nto an evaluation of the facts of this case: \nGuideline B (foreign influence) E2.A2.1.1. (A security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s\nimmediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by\naffection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to\nduress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests\nin other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure); and\nGuideline C (foreign preference) E2.A3.1.1. (When an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United Sates, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States).\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence \nA security risk may exist when an applicant\u2019s immediate family, or other persons to whom\nhe may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.

(An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties\nof affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country) is applicable.\nUnder the Directive, potentially disqualifying conditions may be mitigated through the\napplication of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept and specific mitigating conditions.  When the Government\nproduces evidence raising potentially disqualifying conditions, an Applicant has the burden to\nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the conditions.   The government never\n52\nhas the burden of disproving a mitigating condition.53\nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. provides (A determination that\nthe immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters),\ncohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States).  Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of\nFI MC 1, the Appeal Board has decided that Applicant must prove that his family members,\ncohabitant or associates are not agents of a foreign power, and are not in a position to be exploited\nby a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and\nthe U.S.  [emphasis added]\n54\nApplicant\u2019s brothers, sisters, and parents do not meet the definition of \u201cagent of a foreign\npower\u201d under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 438(6) and 1801(b).  Similarly, they would not be considered as an\n\u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d under the more expansive definition adopted by the Appeal Board.  The\navailable evidence indicates his brothers, sisters, and parents have no ties to or economic dependence\nupon the Jordanian government.  The Appeal Board described my mentioning of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n438(6) and 1801(b) as a \u201cproblematic statement.\u201d  The statutory definition for \u201cagent of a foreign\npower\u201d was explicitly included in Executive Order 12968, Aug. 2, 1995, Part 1.1f, which\nestablished, \u201ca uniform Federal personnel security program for employees who will be considered\nfor initial or continued access to classified information.\u201d  The Appeal Board\u2019s decision  reiterating\n55\nthe broad definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d does not address why Executive Order 12968 is\nnot controlling.56\n\nFI MC 1, especially the scope and definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d). \nDirective, \u00b6 E2.

In regard to FI MC 3, the\nAppeal Board has determined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent.\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  Moreover, contacts with such family members are\npresumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id.  In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal error to give significant weight\nto any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States (ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd.\nMay 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in the foreign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and\nnoncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the [foreign] government has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR\nCase No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd.

Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives spend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case\nNo. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of any connection between the foreign relative and the foreign\ngovernment in question (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at\nexploitation in the past (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship\nwith the U.S., its stable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the U.S. (ISCR Case\nNo. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)); and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \u201cmeticulous work habits\n10\nMost importantly, I did not then and now reiterate that despite my reservations about the\ncorrectness of the Appeal Board\u2019s approach I unconditionally agree that I am bound by the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence.  My previous decision accepted the Appeal Board\u2019s decision, and this remand\naccepts the Appeal Board\u2019s decision about the non-applicability of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 438(6) 1801(b).\nThe second prong of the test is whether the relatives in question are \u201cin a position to be\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d   The federal statute, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(a), defines\n57\n\u201cforeign power\u201d to include: a foreign government; a faction of a foreign nation; an entity openly\nacknowledged by a foreign government to be controlled by that foreign government; a group engaged\nin international terrorism; a foreign-based political organization; or an entity directed and controlled\nby a foreign government. \nHowever, as discussed above, in order to apply the second prong of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the\nAppeal Board requires that applicants affirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone\nwould attempt to exploit a foreign relative in the future.   This is an impossibility as there is never\n58\na 100% guarantee that a government would not exploit its own citizens - even in the U.S.  The\nstandard should be a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d because adopting the \u201cimpossibility\u201d standard acts to\nnullify FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1.59\n\nand practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)).\nISCR Case No. 03-22643 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2005).\n60\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007). \n61\n11\nAnother less significant reason not to apply FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. is the history of terrorist\nactivity in Jordan.  The Appeal Board has limited the applicability of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. where\nthere is a history of terrorist activity in the foreign country in question.   There is no question that\n60\nterrorist organizations operate in the country of Jordan.  Applicant\u2019s family living in Jordan are\nsubject to terrorist activities at any time.  Are they at any greater risk if Applicant holds a security\nclearance?  Probably not.  Terrorists strike at different targets, at different times, often in random\nlocations, and the fear that arises from these attacks is primarily based on that randomness -  not\nknowing where or when an attack might occur.  But the terrorist activity in Jordan is not state-\nsponsored terror by the Jordanian government.  The government of Jordan is as much a victim of\nterrorist activity as are its citizens.  Applicant and his family living in the United States are just as\ngreat at risk from random terrorist activity as evidenced by the bombing of the Oklahoma City\nfederal building as well as the events that occurred on September 11, 2001.  Terrorist attacks are\nincreasing world-wide: Spain; Great Britain, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Indonesia, Russia, Japan, United\nStates, Lebanon, Egypt,  and Northern Ireland have experienced terrorist activities in recent years.\nUnfortunately, terrorism is a part of life at this period of the 21  century.  The fact that terrorists\nst\noperate in Jordan has no more bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance than does\nthe fact that terrorist organizations have operated in the United States. \nUnder the Directive, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3., it may be mitigating where \u201c[c]ontact and\ncorrespondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s contact with his\nsiblings has been casual, isolated and infrequent.  Although there is a presumption that contacts with\nfamily members are not casual, he has seen his family three times in about twenty years.  He does\nnot call them or exchange email\u2019s with them.  I find this to be casual contacts.  But he has regular\nand frequent contact with his mother.  This potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nI conclude that no Guideline B Mitigating Conditions apply, and I expressly and specifically\nindicate that I have not relied \u201cexplicitly or implicitly\u201d on any of the Mitigating Conditions listed\nunder Guideline B of the Directive.  \n61\nForeign Preference \nThe Government has established its case under Guideline C by showing that Applicant has\nexercised dual citizenship with Jordan by possessing a Jordanian passport.  Therefore, Foreign\nPreference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.2. (The exercise of dual citizenship) and\nE2.A3.1.2.2. (Possession and/or use of a foreign passport) apply.  The SOR subparagraph 2.c.\nalleges that Applicant maintains dual citizenship so he can acquire property in Jordan in the distant\nfuture.  FP DC E2.A3.1.2.6.

It is known administratively as the \u2018Money Memorandum\u2019 because it was\nissued by Arthur L. Money, Assistant Secretary of Defense.  It is also known as the ASD C3I Memorandum.\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B, supra, at 2.\n63\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.3.\n64\nISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

May 10, 2006).\n12\nThe DoD Money Memorandum  of August 16, 2000, clarifies DoD policy regarding the\n62\npossession and/or use of foreign passports. It requires that \u201cany clearance be denied or revoked\nunless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the\nappropriate agency of the United States Government.\u201d  Under the Money Memorandum, possession\nand/or use of a foreign passport is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety,\nrequirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  Applicant\u2019s passport expired in\n2004.  Therefore, the Money Memorandum does not apply.  Notwithstanding, Applicant took the\naffirmative act of writing a letter renouncing his citizenship and surrendering his expired passport\nand mailed it via UPS next day air.   He did this to be absolutely sure he demonstrated a good-faith\n63\nintention to renounce his citizenship, and the subsequent rejection by Jordan should not be\nconsidered against him.\nForeign Preference Mitigating Condition E2.A3.1.3.4. (Individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship) is applicable.  All that is required is an intent to renounce\ncitizenship.  The act of mailing his letter and passport is clear intent to revoke.  Accordingly, I find\nGuideline C for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept is the heart of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible\nfor a security clearance.   Indeed, the Appeal Board has repeatedly held that an administrative judge\n64\nmay find in favor of an applicant where no specific mitigating conditions apply.65\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or her relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  As noted above, \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1,\nE2.2.2, and E2.2.3 of the Directive specifically require each administrative judge to consider all the\nfacts and circumstances, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual\ncase.  To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual per se rule against granting clearances to any\nperson with ties to persons in a foreign country, contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.\n\u201cAlthough the position of an applicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the\nfavorable application of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances\n(including the realistic potential for exploitation) may still warrant a favorable application of the\nrelevant general factors.\u201d66\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n67\nSee ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 10,\n68\n2002).\nISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).\n69\nISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\n70\nISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).\n71\nISCR Case No. 03-21423 at 7-10.\n72\n13\nThe \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d  is an important factor\n67\nweighing against grant of a security clearance for Applicant.  The character of Jordan\u2019s government,\nincluding the government itself, entities controlled by Jordanian government, and terrorism are\nrelevant.  However, this factor is not determinative; it is merely one of many factors which must be\nconsidered.  Of course, nothing in Guideline B suggests it is limited to countries that are hostile to\nthe United States.   The Appeal Board repeatedly warns against \u201creliance on overly simplistic\n68\ndistinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline\nB.\u201d   It is well understood that \u201c[t]he United States has a compelling interest in protecting and\n69\nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized\nto have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical\nto those of the United States.\u201d   Distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be\n70\nmade with extreme caution.  Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and\nunexpectedly.  Moreover, even friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.  Finally,\nfriendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in economic,\nscientific, military, and technical fields.   The relationship between a foreign government and the\n71\nU.S. is relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely to\nattempt to exploit a resident or citizen to against the U.S. through the Applicant.  The nature of the\nforeign government might also relate to the question of whether the foreign government or an entity\nit controls would risk jeopardizing its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its\nprivate citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray this country. \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Jordan are very limited.  His children and spouse are not citizens\nof Jordan.  His children speak very little Arabic, and they do not speak any around the home.  He\ndoes not own property in Jordan.\nA friendly relationship between the United States and Jordan is not determinative, but it may\nmake it less likely that a Jordan would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through his relatives or\nassociates.   His family members currently residing in Jordan are vulnerable to pressure and\n72\ncoercion; although they have no connection to or dependence upon a foreign power, they are still\nunder the physical control of the Jordanian government.  Moreover, there is a threat of terrorism in\nJordan.  Applicant\u2019s eight siblings and parents live in Jordan and are therefore vulnerable.  Although\nthere is no evidence of any connection between terrorists and Applicant\u2019s family members in Jordan,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-22643 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22,\n73\n2005).  \nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n74\n14\nthe terrorists could learn of Applicant\u2019s family and then target them to pressure Applicant.   But that\n73\nis a possibility of Applicant\u2019s immediate family living in the U.S.\nWeighing in support of grant of a security clearance are Applicant\u2019s close connections to the\nUnited States.  His wife and four children are native-born citizens and residents of the United States.\nThey have received and continue to benefit from the liberties and protection afforded U.S. citizens.\nHe is 46 years old, and is mature and responsible.  He has lived in the United States for 28 years, his\nwhole adult life.  He attended college in the United States, and has been a U.S. citizen for 21 years.\nHe has been married 24 years\u2013a strong and stable relationship.  He has one brother who lives in the\nUnited States.\nThey have significant economic connections to the United States.  They bought a house in\nthe United States in 1997.  They pay their bills on time, have a good credit rating, own an apartment\nbuilding, and have U.S. stock investments.  They have a United States checking account, savings\naccount, and 401K account.\nApplicant is a law abiding person.  He has never been arrested.  His track record of\ncompliance with the law supports a conclusion that he will continue to abide by the law, especially\nnational security law. \nApplicant and his wife are involved in their local community.  They are block watch captains\nfor their block.  When there is a U.S. election they vote in it.  He has worked for government large\ncommercial contractors as an engineer for many years, and his wife has been a public high school\nteacher for about a decade.\nApplicant\u2019s manager, who has worked for the contractor for 28 years, and worked with\nApplicant for three years described him as an excellent employee, who complies with security\nrequirements.\nApplicant\u2019s record of successful employment, the good relationship between Jordan and the\nUnited States, and the Jordanian government\u2019s respect for human rights, make it unlikely that he\nwould be vulnerable to improper influence.  \nMost importantly, it is necessary to consider Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation through\nhis relatives.  Applicant is a mature individual with almost twenty years of successful employment\nin this country.  He is a U.S. citizen and was educated in this country.  Applicant has strong ties to\nthe United States.  Because of Applicant\u2019s deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the\nU.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  I am\nconfident that he would report any attempt of coercion by terrorists to U.S. authorities.  I find the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress does not constitute a security risk.74\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n75\n15\nI observed Applicant during the hearing, and especially during his testimony.  I find his\ntestimony to be believable and find him to be a sincere and credible witness, because he answered\nquestions directly, completely, and honestly.  \nThe record evidence supports approval of Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  I\ntake this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, supra, my careful\nconsideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent\n75\nfactors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under Enclosure\n2 of the Directive.  Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case.  I conclude\nApplicant is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nOn remand, in light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I find again\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n\n16\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on July 8, 2003. \nOn October 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 23, 2007; answered it in \nan undated document; and requested a decision on the record without a hearing. DOHA \nreceived his answer on November 5, 2007. On December 7, 2007, Department Counsel \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge, pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.8. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 27, 2007, and the case \nwas assigned to me on January 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February \nApril 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n7, 2008, setting the case for February 28, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which \nwas admitted without objection. The record closed when the hearing adjourned. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 7, 2008. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations of criminal conduct \nunder Guideline J, but he denied the allegation of falsifying his SF 86 under Guideline \nE. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old apprentice draftsman employed by a federal \ncontractor. If he successfully completes his apprenticeship, he will receive an \nassociate\u2019s degree in marine engineering (Tr. 7). He worked in a number of entry-level \njobs after high school and was working as a pizza delivery driver before being hired by \nhis current employer. He has worked for his current employer since July 2004 (GX 5 at \n1). He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of burglary in 1999 and placed on supervised probation \nfor about two years. He was 19 or 20 years old at the time. The offenses occurred when \nApplicant, his brother, and a friend were drinking beer and were intoxicated. The friend \ndecided to break into a store. Applicant and his brother remained outside the store while \nthe friend broke in and stole some beer. Applicant testified he tried to stop his friend \nfrom breaking in (Tr. 56). The friend put the beer in his car and all three drove away (GX \n5 at 2; Tr. 53-54). Applicant was charged with a felony; but the charge was reduced to a \nmisdemeanor, he was treated as a youthful offender, and the record was sealed (Tr. 49-\n50). \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) after his \ngirlfriend caused a disturbance in the parking lot of a bar and the police were \nsummoned. When the police arrived, Applicant was sitting in his car with the keys in the \nignition. He had turned on the ignition switch to operate the cigarette lighter (Tr. 59). \nThe case was pending for about 18 months because his lawyer contested the charge. \nFinally, Applicant agreed to plead guilty if the record would be sealed (Tr. 60).  His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for about 18 months and he paid a fine (Tr. 60-61; GX 5 \nat 3).  \n \n \nIn December 2001, Applicant and his girlfriend had an argument during which he \npunched her in the face and she stabbed him. His girlfriend drove him to a hospital, \nwhich notified the police because of the stab wound. Applicant and his girlfriend told the \npolice that an intruder had entered their residence, stabbed Applicant, and hit his \ngirlfriend in the face. Applicant later admitted the report was false. He was charged with \nfalse reporting and domestic violence. Two warrants were issued for his failure to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nappear in court. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to filing a false report. He was \nsentenced to ten days in jail, suspended, and a fine. The domestic violence charge was \ndisposed of by a nolle prosequi (GX 4 at 1-2; GX 5 at 3-4).  \n \n \nIn April 2002, Applicant and his girlfriend moved to the New England area. In \nFebruary 2003, they had another argument and altercation. It occurred after Applicant \nbroke off their relationship when he learned his girlfriend was selling crack cocaine. His \ngirlfriend accused him of punching her in the face and kicking her in the stomach. When \nthe police arrived, Applicant initially used his brother\u2019s name to identify himself, but then \nreconsidered and identified himself correctly (Tr. 68-69; GX 3 at 3, 6, 9-10). He was \ncharged with domestic violence and disorderly conduct. Applicant denied striking his \ngirlfriend. According to Applicant, she struck him in the head with a pipe and then \ninjured and bruised herself to make herself look like a victim (GX 5 at 4; Tr. 67-71). \nApplicant enrolled in anger management classes for one and half months in an effort to \nlook good for his trial. He stopped attending the classes when he decided he did not \nhave an anger-management problem (GX 5 at 6). The charges were disposed of by a \nnolle prosequi (GX 3; GX 5 at 4).  \n \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had long since ended his relationship with \nthe girlfriend involved in the above incidents, and was married to another woman (Tr. \n52). He blamed the offenses on \u201cbad choices in a girlfriend\u201d and testified he had \nmatured, changed, and become a responsible person (Tr. 52). \n \n \nApplicant executed his SF 86 in July 2003, about a year before he was hired.  He \nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to question 23 on the SF 86, asking if there were currently any charges \npending against him. He disclosed the charges arising from the February 2003 incident, \nwhich were pending at the time he executed his SF 86. He answered \u201cno\u201d to question \n24, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to \nalcohol or drugs, and he did not disclose the 2001 DUI charge. The instructions for this \nquestion directed him to \u201creport information regardless of whether the record in your \ncase has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the record.\u201d He also answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 26, asking if, during the last seven years, he had been arrested for, charged \nwith, or convicted of any offenses not listed in questions 21 through 25. He did not \ndisclose the 1999 burglary charge, the 2001 DUI charge, or the arrest for false reporting \nand domestic violence in February 2002, all of which had occurred before he moved to \nNew England. In this question, like question 24, he was directed to report information \neven though the case was \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the record. \n \nApplicant completed his SF 86 at home and spent \u201cmaybe a couple of hours\u201d \ncompleting it (Tr. 71, 72, and 75). He made several handwritten corrections after it was \nprinted, including corrections to his birth date, his mother\u2019s first name, his sister\u2019s first \nname, an employer\u2019s name, and a supervisor\u2019s name (GX 2 at 1, 3, and 5).  \n \nApplicant testified he misunderstood the questions and was unaware that he was \nrequired to disclose his arrests because they were either youthful offender arrests, \nsealed records, or cases disposed of by nolle prosequi (Tr. 49). He admitted the arrests \n\n \n4 \n \n \nin an interview with a security investigator in July 2004, about a year after he executed \nhis SF 86, except for the February 2002 arrest, which was not mentioned. He also told \nthe security investigator he did not intentionally omit information from his SF 86, but the \narrests occurred during a hard time in his life.  He told the investigator, \u201cI try to forget \nthose issues in my life.\u201d (GX 5 at 1.) At the hearing, he testified he did not remember the \nFebruary 2002 arrest when he executed his SF 86 (Tr. 51). \n \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant testified he did not know why he did not \ndisclose his arrests. He testified he did not omit the information for fear of not getting the \njob, but he \u201cdidn\u2019t care to answer the questions,\u201d because he did not expect to be \noffered the job (Tr. 77, 86).  He testified he may have mentioned some of his arrests to \nsome people at work, but most of his coworkers and supervisors are unaware of his \narrest record (Tr. 86). \n \nA senior draftsman who works with Applicant regards him as honest, \nknowledgeable, and helpful (AX A). A union steward who has worked for Applicant\u2019s \nemployer for 28 years and known Applicant since he began his current job testified that \nhe trained Applicant and became his friend.  He testified Applicant is a quick learner, \ntrustworthy, and has done nothing to raise doubt about his character (Tr. 27-32). This \nwitness believed the security concerns were based on two sealed arrests, but he \napparently was unaware of the allegation of falsifying the SF 86 (Tr. 31). \n \nA coworker who has worked for Applicant\u2019s employer for 20 years and known \nApplicant for about four years testified Applicant is a hard worker, diligent, polite, a good \nfriend, and \u201can all around good guy.\u201d He believes Applicant is honest and \u201cabsolutely\u201d \ncould be trusted with sensitive information (Tr. 35-40). This witness was aware in \ngeneral terms of the allegation of falsifying the SF 86 (Tr. 39). \n \nAnother coworker and friend who has worked for Applicant\u2019s employer for 20 \nyears and known Applicant for about four years testified he has never seen anything to \nindicate Applicant would be a security risk (Tr. 42-46). This witness was unaware of the \nallegations in the SOR (Tr. 45). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \n\n \n5 \n \n \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was charged with burglary in 1999 (\u00b6 1.a), charged \nwith DUI in 2001 (\u00b6 1.b), charged with making a false police report and assault (\u00b6 1.c), \nand arrested for assault in February 2002 (\u00b6 1.d). It also alleged two warrants were \n\n \n6 \n \n \nissued for his failure to appear on the charges of assault and making a false police \nreport (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f). Finally, it alleges he was charged with assault and disorderly \nconduct in 2003 (\u00b6 1.g).  \n \n \nThe record reflects that the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d duplicate each \nother because they are based on the same assault.  When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at \n3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.d in Applicant=s favor.   \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s record of arrests and convictions is \nsufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Applicant\u2019s record \nof criminal conduct began nine years ago and ended more than five years ago. His \npassive participation in the burglary was the product of alcohol, bad judgment, and bad \ncompany. He was an aider and abettor, not a principal. His other arrests arose from an \nill-advised relationship long since ended. His life turned around once he broke up with \nhis old girlfriend and started his current job. With the exception of the false police report, \nnone of these offenses cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. His false police report, however, was the beginning of a pattern of \nfalsehoods, followed by falsely identifying himself to a police officer and falsifying his SF \n86, discussed in greater detail below. Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is established \nfor the burglary, DUI, and domestic assaults, but not for the false police report.  \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). Applicant\u2019s current job was his first opportunity for a career and successful future. \nDuring the past four years he has gained the respect of his colleagues and mentors, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmarried, and acted responsibly. He has admitted his mistakes and wants to put them \nbehind him. He no longer engages in crimes against property (i.e., burglary), alcohol-\nrelated misconduct, or domestic violence. He has continued, however, to have problems \nwith candor. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is established for the burglary, DUI, and domestic \nassaults, but not for the false police report. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges applicant falsified his SF 86 by deliberately omitting the arrests \nand charges alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d. The concern under this guideline \nis set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). When a \nfalsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \n \n \nApplicant presented himself at the hearing as intelligent and articulate.  He had \nno difficulty understanding the questions on his SF 86 at the hearing. However, his \nexplanations for not disclosing his full arrest record were implausible and contradictory. \nHe finally admitted he \u201cdidn\u2019t care to answer the questions\u201d because he did not believe \nhe would get the job. I conclude he intentionally omitted his record of arrests in his \nprevious home state, thereby raising AG \u00b6 16(a) and shifting the burden to him to refute, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant \nmade no effort to correct the omissions from his SF 86 until he was confronted with the \nfacts a year later.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). The first \nprong (\u201cso minor\u201d) is not established, because the falsification of his SF 86 is a felony \nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801. The second prong (\u201cso much time\u201d) is not established, \nbecause the falsification occurred in his current application for a clearance.  The third \nprong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established, because his falsification was part of a pattern \nof dishonesty, starting with his false police report in December 2001, continuing when \nhe attempted to deceive a police officer about his identity in February 2003, and ending \nwith his false answers on his current security clearance application.  The fourth prong \n(\u201cunique circumstances\u201d) is not established because the falsification occurred during a \nroutine security clearance application.  Finally, his pattern of falsification casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). After considerable ducking and weaving during cross-\nexamination at the hearing, Applicant finally acknowledged that he chose not to make \nfull disclosure of his criminal record because he did not think he would get the job. The \ncircumstances in which he falsified his SF 86 have changed, in that he has matured, \nmade new friends, married, and found a good job with a future. However, the last \nelement of this mitigating condition (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) is undermined by his record of \nfalsification in other circumstances. I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of \nestablishing AG \u00b6 17(d). \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). This condition is not established, because \nApplicant has not made full disclosure of his criminal record to his supervisors and most \nof his coworkers. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is still a young man, but he is a substantially different person from the \nmisguided youth involved in the burglary in 1999 or the person involved in a three-year \ndysfunctional romantic relationship that ended in February 2003. His outlook on life \nappears to have changed after he started his current job. He has matured and grown in \nmany respects. However, candor is essential in the security clearance process, and he \nhas not yet established a record of candor. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on criminal conduct and his \nfalsification of his SF 86. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 17, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n\nA determination that the immediate family members...in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a\n1\nposition to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the\npersons involved and the United States.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E2.A2.1.3.1.\n\u201cContact and correspondence with foreign citizens are causal and infrequent...\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E2.A2.1.3.1.\n2\n2\n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On\nJune 27, 2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to\nDirective  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\napplying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 1;  whether the Judge erred in applying\n1\nFIMC 3;  and whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had satisfactorily explained his failure\n2\nto provide information about his foreign financial holdings and his prior criminal record was\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We reverse the decision of the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings: Applicant is a 38 year-old-supply clerk for a defense\ncontractor, with prior military service during which time he held a security clearance.  \nIn October 1986, Applicant was charged and convicted for public intoxication.  In December\n1986, Applicant, who lived on a naval base as a military dependent, was stopped at a random gate\nsearch.  The search yielded a small amount of a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d which Applicant has denied\nactually belonged to him.  In March 1987, Applicant was charged and convicted of Driving While\nIntoxicated (DWI) and charged with trespassing on government property.  In December 1987\nApplicant was convicted of possession of alcohol by a minor.\nIn filling out his security clearance questionnaire, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 24.\nThis question inquired whether Applicant had ever been charged or convicted of any offense relating\nto alcohol or drugs.  Applicant stated that he believed that the question only required him to go back\n10 years.\nIn 1993, while stationed with the U.S. Army in Korea, Applicant met a woman, a Korean\nnational, whom he married in 1997.  Applicant\u2019s wife has a brother, who is a truck driver in Korea.\nApplicant states that he has only met his brother-in-law once.  In 2002 Applicant and his wife\npurchased a house in Korea.  The house is in the wife\u2019s name only in order to avoid extensive\npaperwork.  Applicant\u2019s spouse has about $150,000 in Korean bank accounts.  Applicant did not list\nthe house on the security clearance application nor the bank accounts \u201cbecause he did not believe\nhe was required to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is\n3\na citizen of, or resident in, a foreign country.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E2.A2.1.2.1.\n3\nThe Judge also found that the Republic of Korea is a stable democracy, the U.S.\u2019s seventh\nlargest trading partner and largest export market.  The U.S. is a prime target of economic espionage,\nKorea being listed as among the top seven nations conducting such activities against the U.S.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel does not challenge\nthe Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, the findings are not an issue on appeal.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nA.  Application of FIMC 1\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s wife and brother-in-law raise security concerns under\nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FIDC) 1.   As a consequence, the burden shifted to\n3\nApplicant to establish that to grant him a security clearance is clearly in the national interest.  See\nDirective  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  Because Applicant elected not to request a hearing, the Judge was limited to\nconsidering the evidence in the File of Relevant Material (FORM).  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the record is devoid of facts from which to infer that\nApplicant could not be subjected to coercion through his relatives.  We find merit in Department\nCounsel\u2019s argument.  In the first place, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s wife is not an agent\nof a foreign power is based upon the definition of that term contained in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435 et seq.  The\nBoard has previously held that this statutory definition is self limiting in nature and inadequate to\naddress the security concerns arising under Guideline B.  See ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 4-6 (App.\n\n4\nBd. Jan. 5, 2007).  Therefore, to this extent at least, the Judge\u2019s conclusion is arbitrary, capricious,\nand contrary to law.\nAdditionally, the Judge does not discuss the extent to which Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s house,\nlocated in Korea, and in which Applicant resides, and Korean bank accounts constitute a potential\nmeans of coercion.    The Judge made only a conclusory observation that these matters are not of\nsecurity significance but did not explain why.  Decision at 6.  In doing so the Judge failed to consider\nan important aspect of the case.  See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).  Again,\nwe conclude that this is error.\nB.  Application of FIMC 3\nBoard precedent presumes that an applicant\u2019s family ties are neither casual nor infrequent.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-24267 at 7 (App. Bd. May 24, 2005).  The Department Counsel does not\nchallenge the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant has only met him once.  However, there is no evidence\nin the record to establish the extent of any communication between Applicant, or Applicant\u2019s wife,\nand the brother-in-law.  While it is possible that neither have any contact with him, Applicant bears\nthe burden of persuasion to establish this mitigating condition.  We conclude that the evidence in the\nFORM is insufficient to do so and that the Judge\u2019s application of FIMC 3 is in error.\nC.  Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant provided a credible explanation for neglecting to\nprovide information on security clearance form\nWe have examined the record evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s having failed to list his\ncriminal past and his wife\u2019s Korean property holdings.  As regards the latter, he stated that, since the\nrelevant questions were directed explicitly to him, he did not believe that Applicant was required to\nlist his wife\u2019s holdings.  The FORM contains a character reference from a warrant officer who knows\nApplicant and who opines that Applicant \u201cis a very literal person and if someone were to ask him\nquestions about \u2018YOU\u2019 he is only going to give. . .information about himself.\u201d  Item 3.  We conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s credibility determination on this matter is supported by substantial evidence.\nHowever, as to the former, we reach a different conclusion.  Applicant states that, since he\nwas only to list his residences for the previous 10 years, he believed that he was only required to list\ncriminal activity within that period as well.  However, question 24 is clear and unequivocal in its\nlanguage\u2013\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or\ndrugs?\u201d (emphasis added).  There is no evidence in the FORM to demonstrate why such a belief\nwould be reasonable under the circumstances, especially to someone who by nature takes matters\nas literally as the character reference mentioned above suggests.  Having elected not to have a\nhearing, Applicant denied himself the opportunity to provide a more detailed explanation as to his\nunderstanding of what information he was expected to provide and to submit himself to questioning\nby Department Counsel and by the Judge.  We conclude that Applicant has not sustained his burden\nof persuasion under Guideline E and that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision as to that Guideline is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Given the lack of record evidence in this case, we\nconclude that there is no reason to remand the decision to the Judge.\n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.  \n \nOn September 11, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 18, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On February 27, 2009, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me and issued a Notice of Hearing on March 10, 2009. The case was heard on \nApril 23, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nMarch 24, 2009, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 20 \ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) 1 through \n38 into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record \nopen until April 10, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted two exhibits that I marked AE 39 and 40 and \nadmitted into the record over the objection of the Government. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on April 2, 2009. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Ruling \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n6011. (GE 21) Said statute sets forth the general requirements for individuals to file \nincome tax returns. The exhibit was not admitted into evidence, but is included in the \nrecord as an Administrative Notice Exhibit. Hence, the facts administratively noticed are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. Applicant \ndid not object to the Department\u2019s request, and said document was admitted for that \npurpose. (Tr. 36) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.h.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old married man with two young children. He has two \nassociate degrees, one which he completed in 1996 in electrical engineering. He started \nworking for his current employer in 1987. He is an associate engineer, earning \napproximately $80,000 annually.  \n \n \nIn September 2004, a Government investigator interviewed Applicant about \nstatements he made on his SF 86, pertaining to a lawsuit he filed in Federal District \nCourt, in which he asserted his right not to file income tax returns. Essentially, he \nbelieves that the salary he earns through his employment with a federal contractor does \nnot constitute taxable income, as defined by the U.S. Constitution. (Tr. 77, 131) Hence, \nhe is not required to file returns because he does not earn taxable income. (Tr. 77-78) \nHe began researching this issue in 1999 and arrived at his present position by 2003. \nPrior to that year, he filed state and Federal returns for 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. \nHowever, once he completed his analysis on the matter, he filed amended returns and \nrequested refunds for the years. He has challenged the IRS and brought suit on this \nissue in Federal court. He has lost both challenges. (GE 2) \n \nIn April 2003, a Federal District Court entered a Memorandum Order dismissing \nApplicant\u2019s case against the Federal and state governments, based on jurisdictional \ngrounds. Applicant filed an application for habeas relief, in which he sought state and \nFederal income tax refunds for the calendar year 2000, arguing that he had a civil right \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nto deduct his earned wages from his gross income as compensation for personal \nservices actually rendered. (GE 13) \n \n \nOn June 6, 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) responded to Applicant \nregarding documents he filed setting forth his argument that he is not required to file \nFederal income tax returns because he does not earn taxable income. In separate \nletters, referencing his previous correspondence for tax years 1999, 2000 and 2001, the \nIRS stated: \n \n \nWe have determined that the document(s) referred to above is a frivolous \ndocument. The position you have taken has no basis in law and \nrepresents a frivolous position. The tax laws are very clear and have been \ntested in the courts \u2013 including the Supreme Court of the United States. \nClaims, such as yours, have been considered and rejected repeatedly as \nfrivolous and without merit by the federal courts. Therefore, we will not \nrespond to future correspondence from you concerning these same \nissues. (GE 15) \n \nDespite the dismissal of his law suit and notification of the IRS\u2019s position in 2003, \nApplicant has continued to pursue his position. The July 2008 SOR alleged that \nApplicant failed to file eight income tax returns, as required by law. The status of those \nreturns is as follows: \n \n1. Applicant filed his 2004 Federal Income Tax Return in December 2008, in \norder to obtain a refund. (Tr. 71) There is no evidence that he received an \nextension to file three years late. \n \n2. Applicant filed his 2004 state tax return in July 2008, after learning a \nrefund was owed to him. (Tr. 72) There is no evidence that he received an \nextension to file three years late. \n \n3. Applicant has not filed his 2005 Federal Income Tax Return, nor obtained \nan extension of time in which to do so.  (Tr. 72; 76) \n \n4. Applicant filed his 2005 state income tax return in July 2008, in order to \navoid an additional penalty and obtain a refund. (Tr. 104-105 ) There is no \nevidence that he received an extension to file this return late. \n \n5. Applicant has not filed his 2006 Federal Income Tax Return, nor obtained \nan extension of time in which to do so. (Tr. 72) \n \n6. Applicant has not filed his 2006 state income tax return, nor obtained an \nextension of time in which to do so. (Tr. 73)  \n \n7. Applicant has not filed his 2007 Federal Income Tax Return, nor obtained \nan extension of time in which to do so. (Tr. 73) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n8.  Applicant has not filed his 2007 state income tax return, nor obtained an \nextension of time in which to do so. (Tr. 73 )  \n \nIn a second interview in February 2008, Applicant admitted that he had not filed \nFederal or state income tax returns from 2004 to 2007. He continued to assert that he \nwas not required to file them because he was not a \u201ctax payer.\u201d (GE 3 at 184) He has \npersistently requested the IRS to document and trace the history of its interpretation and \ndefinition of income. (Id.) He will file the outstanding returns in the future in order to \nobtain refunds, but is \u201cwaiting for the right time to file a refund, and . . . waiting also for \nanybody yet to show [him] [he has] a requirement to file.\u201d (Tr. 103, 128) He does not \nintend to timely file his 2008 returns nor obtain an extension for filing. (Tr. 74) \n \nApplicant submitted a copy of a 2002 state court opinion (filed by another \nindividual) that specifically rejected Applicant\u2019s arguments pertaining to his interpretation \nof the definition of \u201cincome.\u201d (AE 33) When questioned about the court\u2019s interpretation of \nthe word, Applicant said, \u201cThe State is off base.\u201d (Tr. 136)  \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of his 2008 Performance and Development Summary \nthat noted an acceptable rating in most categories and exceptional in a few areas. His \nsupervisor wrote that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccontributions continue to span a wide range of \nactivities within the department.  .  .  He is willing to accept a variety of assignments and \nalways digs-in quickly to contribute.\u201d (AE 33) Applicant\u2019s employer and colleagues are \naware of his position regarding the requirement to file income tax returns.  \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant vigorously asserted his position that he has no \nobligation to file his returns because he does not earn income within the meaning of the \nconstitution. He presented extensive research and detailed summaries of his analysis to \nsupport his argument. He will continue to challenge the issue. In his closing argument, \nhe added: \n \nNo one has showed that my income is taxable and meets the definition \npursuant to Section 61. I\u2019ve provided the congressional records, the \nSupreme Court cases, the definitions as evidence and records that are out \nthere that define it, and nobody\u2019s been able to prove it otherwise. (Tr. 153) \n \n* * *  \nThe Department of Defense has made a claim that I earn Section 61 \nincome, which they haven\u2019t proven otherwise that I actually have made \nSection 61 income. It\u2019s a presumption that I have, but I have seen no \nevidence showing proof that I have. . . .  And, the Department of Defense \nclaims that I\u2019m an employee that\u2019s taxable and that would be pursuant to \nthe W4 withholding definition of \u201cincome,\u201d and I haven\u2019t seen any evidence \nshowing that I\u2019m that type of employee. And that definition is very clear to \nread. So pursuant to the requirements of a W4 withholding form, my \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nincome doesn\u2019t meet it and my \u201cemployee\u201d by definition doesn\u2019t meet that \nrequirement. I cannot fill out a W4. [Sic] (Tr. 154-155)   \n \n \n \nIn his preface to AE 39, which Applicant submitted post-hearing, he states \nas follows: \n \nNOTE: What I am presenting is not some NEW discovery that I need \nto go in front of Congress with and I am NOT arguing the law. The \nlaws are written correctly and I have no problem with any of them \nThe problem is the DOD is misunderstanding WHO I am and not \npaying attention to statutory \u201cterms\u201d, congressional \u201cdefinitions\u201d, \nand my \u201cunalienable rights\u201d when attempting to apply the \u201cfailure to \nfile\u201d statutes to me.  [Sic] \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations are \narticulated in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out nine conditions that could raise security concerns, two of which \nmay potentially be applicable in this case:  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony, he \ndeliberately failed to timely file Federal and state tax returns for the years 2004, 2005, \n2006, and 2007, as legally required. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above two \ndisqualifications. In addition to these disqualifications, the evidence raised an overall \nconcern pertaining to Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment and willingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, which in turn question his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information under this guideline.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifications, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. AG \u00b6 \n20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties: \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s refusal to timely file his income tax returns has been ongoing since \n2004 and continues into the present. His actions are recent, not isolated, and cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment; hence, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply. \nHis income tax issues are clearly within his control, such that AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \napplicable. Although Applicant filed his 2004 Federal and state income tax returns in \n2008, as well as his 2005 state return, he did not do so timely and has not filed any \nother return to date, as required by law. Hence, there is no evidence that the problems \nare being resolved, which is necessary to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant disputed, in court and directly to the IRS, the legitimacy of the income tax \nstatutes that require him to file tax returns. He lost both challenges; thus, AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. There is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(d) or AG \u00b6 \n20(f).   \n \nThe Appeal Board articulated its general security concern in ISCR No. 94-0954 \n(October 16, 1995) at 3, in a similar case in which an applicant argued that he was not \nobligated to file income tax returns. The Board stated:  \n \nThere is a nexus between Applicant\u2019s conduct and his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Beyond the fact that Applicant shows poor judgment \nby willfully engaging in criminal conduct, he believes he has the right and \nability to determine on his own what laws will apply to him. Accordingly, \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nthe Government cannot be sure he will always follow security rules if he \never begins to believe that they should not apply to him.1 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 44-year-old married \nman with two children. He has successfully worked for his present employer since 1986.  \n \nIn 2003, Applicant challenged the Federal and state governments\u2019 rights to \nrequire him to file income tax returns. His case was subsequently dismissed and \nreferred to as \u201cfrivolous\u201d in the state court. In September 2004, the Government \ninterviewed him about the lawsuit he filed in Federal court and challenges he filed with \nthe IRS about his 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 returns. In February 2008, the \nGovernment again interviewed him and learned that he had not filed income tax returns \nfrom 2004 to 2007. According to his testimony, he does not intend to timely file 2008 \nreturns. Despite his lack of success with legal challenges and notification by the \nGovernment, twice, of its security concerns, Applicant has obstinately persisted in \nadhering to his position and jeopardizing his employment. His behavior and actions in \nthis situation demonstrate serious underlying issues regarding his reliability, good \njudgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which are \ncharacteristics necessary and pertinent to handling classified information.   \n  \nIn another more recent case, involving similar facts, the Appeal Board succinctly \nstated, \u201cDOHA proceedings are not a proper forum for challenging the validity of federal \n                                            \n1The SOR did not raise concerns under the guideline for Criminal Conduct in this case, but has \nraised general concerns under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n\n \n \n \n \n9\ntax matters.\u201d The Board further stated, \u201cFailure to file tax returns suggest that an \napplicant has a problem with complying with well-established governmental rules and \nsystems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting \nclassified information\u201d. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 (December 20, 2002) at 2; See ISCR \nCase No. 97-0744 (November 6, 1998) at p. 3. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance based on issues involving his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. For \nall of the above reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns \narising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:      Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on September 8,\n2003. On January 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under psychological\nconditions (Guideline I), alcohol consumption (Guideline G), and drug involvement\n(Guideline H). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nMay 27, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant furnished an answer to the SOR on February 17, 2009. He provided an\nattachment to his answer which has been admitted in evidence as Applicant\u2019s exhibit\n(AE S). DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 6, 2009, and the hearing was held\non March 25, 2009. At the hearing, nine government exhibits (GE 1 through 9) were\nadmitted in evidence without objection to support the Government\u2019s case. Applicant\ntestified and submitted fifteen exhibits (AE A through AE O). He provided AE P through\nAE R following the hearing within the time allowed. Those exhibits have been admitted\nin evidence. DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.) of the proceedings on April 10,\n2009.\nRulings on Procedure\nI have taken administrative notice of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders (DSM-IV). The diagnostic codes, i.e., 303.30, that appear in the SOR,\ncan be found in the DSM-IV. I have included additional codes in SOR 1.g., and 1.h. For\nexample, the DSM code for alcohol abuse as diagnosed by the certified counselor in\nSOR 1.g. is 305.00. \nSubparagraph 1.a. is amended pursuant to E3.1.17. of the Directive by adding\nthe word \u201cfeatures\u201d after the word \u201cPsychotic\u201d and before the DSM-IV reference.\nSubparagraph 1.h. is amended by replacing \u201cinventions\u201d with \u201cinterventions.\u201d\nThe government moved to amend Subparagraph 3.a. of the SOR as follows:\n\u201cYou used marijuana approximately 90 to 125 times from 1995 to 1999, then\nsporadically until 2003, then two or three times until 2007 (Tr. 79).\u201d The government\nalso requested that subparagraph 3.d. be changed to read: \u201cYou consumed\nhallucinogenic mushrooms approximately 15 to 20 times in 1998 and 1999, and on one\noccasion in February 2008 (Tr. 80).\u201d Both proposed amendments were granted\npursuant to E3.1.17. of the Directive (Id.)\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR has eight allegations under the psychological conditions guideline, five\nallegations under the alcohol consumption guideline, and five allegations under the drug\ninvolvement guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations. \nApplicant has been employed as a test engineer with a defense contractor since\nMay 2007. He has worked for this employer since 2003. He is 32 years old, engaged,\nwith no children. He seeks a security clearance. \nFrom September 19, 2001 to September 25, 2001 (SOR 1.a.), Applicant received\ninpatient treatment (GE 6). The medical history and interview revealed suicidal ideas,\nbut none at the time of admission. Applicant recounted increasing incidents of self-\ndestructive behavior, including, provoking fights at bars, and burning or cutting his wrist.\nBefore admission, Applicant indicated heavier drinking until backout, though he denied\ndrinking when he called the police. Applicant stated he usually drank on the weekends\n\n The exhibit includes medical records that reflect Applicant was treated as an inpatient or outpatient on five\n1\noccasions during the period. \n Applicant indicated his last blackout occurred in June 2008 (Tr. 40). \n2\n3\nonly (Id. at 2). At the time of discharge, a medical doctor diagnosed him with major\ndepression, single episode, without psychotic \u201cfeatures\u201d (296.23) and alcohol\ndependence (303.90) (AE 4, 6).\nApplicant was readmitted to the hospital for mental health treatment from\nOctober 9 to October 11, 2001 (SOR 1.b.). On the day of admission, Applicant\nconsumed 7 beers and liquor. He had a cut on his right wrist (GE 7). He noted drinking\nto the point of blackouts on the weekends, with constant drinking habits since college,\nonly more intense (Id. at 2). The medical record indicated in the medical history portion\nthat Applicant demonstrated poor insight and judgment. Applicant\u2019s discharge diagnosis\nwas alcohol induced mood disorder, (291.89), alcohol dependence (303.30), personality\ndisorder, not otherwise specified (301.9) (AE GE 4, 7).  \nFrom October 8, 2001 to April 11, 2002 (1.c.), Applicant received inpatient and\noutpatient treatment at a behavioral hospital (GE 8).  The course of treatment on\n1\nNovember 15, 2001, showed that Applicant was admitted for inpatient care after\ndrinking daily and showing that he had cut himself; however, he showed no suicidal\nthoughts (Id.) \nOn November 26, 2001 (SOR 1.c.), Applicant was re-admitted to the same\nbehavioral hospital referred to in GE 8. Under the course of treatment portion of the\nmedical records, it was noted that Applicant had a year-long history of self-destructive\nbehavior, blackouts,  coupled with drug and alcohol addiction. A reason for Applicant\u2019s\n2\ncondition was that he was troubled over his father returning to his home country.\nApplicant advised hospital personnel he had terminated his heavy alcohol and drug use\nthe day before he was admitted (Id.).\nOn Applicant\u2019s discharge from treatment on April 11, 2002 (1.c.), he was\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder, depressive episode, severe (296.53); polysubstance\nabuse, and borderline personality disorder. Applicant also received a diagnosis during\noutpatient treatment of bipolar disorder depressed type, alcohol dependence, and\nborderline personality with borderline traits (301.83) (GE 8, 9). \nDuring the course of Applicant\u2019s treatment from January to June 2002 (1.d.), he\nwas diagnosed with substance induced mood, psychotic disorder, experiencing visual\nhallucinations and paranoia, and self-mutilation (GE 4, 9).\nSubparagraph 1.e. of the SOR refers to inpatient treatment Applicant received in\nthe summer of 2004 for depression and alcohol abuse (GE 4). \n\n The counselor also noted that Applicant agreed to report to a psychiatrist for an assessment.\n3\n The DSM-IV activates this specifier when, for a month or more, but less than 12 months, one or more criteria\n4\nfor dependence has been met, but when the full criteria for dependence has not been met. \n The psychologist defined the disorder as an individual having problems learning from his mistakes. \n5\n4\nFrom March 2004 to January 2008 (SOR 1.f.), Applicant received treatment from\nthree mental health professionals. He indicated that he consulted with the first doctor\nabout 10 times, but stopped the sessions because he was feeling better. He consulted\nthe second listed doctor about 10 times, but stopped due to time constraints (Id.).\nApplicant continues to take a medication for obsessive-compulsive disorder prescribed\nby the third doctor listed in SOR 1.f. (Tr. 36-37). \nIn May 2008, (1.g.), a licensed professional counselor, and certified cognitive\naddictions professional, diagnosed Applicant with alcohol abuse (305.00).  According to\n3\nthe assessment letter provided by the counselor (GE 2), this diagnosis was based on\ninterviews with Applicant, and the Alcohol Use Inventory (AUI) questionnaire. In the\ninterview, Applicant described his drinking pattern, and that he occasionally used\nalcohol to deal with stress an anxiety. The counselor believed that the alcohol caused\ndisruptions in Applicant\u2019s personal behavior and social functioning. The counselor chose\nan alcohol abuse over a substance dependence diagnosis since, in the counselor\u2019s\nopinion, Applicant only met two of the criteria for the DSM definition of alcohol\ndependence. There is no indication the counselor had access to the medical records. \nOn July 24, 2008 (1.h.), a clinical psychologist (the government mental health\nprofessional) conducted a mental health evaluation of Applicant (GE 3). Prior to his\nevaluation, he reviewed medical records of Applicant. Next, he conducted a clinical\ninterview of Applicant on June 24, 2008. He noted Applicant\u2019s obsessive-compulsive\nissues, and that Applicant was still receiving medication. Then, the psychologist\nadministered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). The R and Mac\nR scales of the MMPI suggested to the psychologist that \u201c[Applicant] has little insight\ninto the motivation for his drinking and tends to minimize its effects on his personality.\u201d\nThe psychologist opined the testing suggested Applicant was defensive about his\ndrinking (Id.).\nThe diagnosis provided by the psychologist for Applicant was alcohol\ndependence (303.90), in early partial remission,  and personality disorder, not otherwise\n4\nspecified (301.9) (Id. at 2).  The psychologist concluded that because of Applicant\u2019s\n5\nhistorical pattern of drinking, even after several interventions, his drinking may cause a\nsignificant defect in his psychological, social, or occupational functioning in the future.\nThough the psychologist did not believe Applicant would divulge classified information,\nthe drinking that impairs his judgment could lead to accidents or physical injury (Id. at\n3).  \n\n5\nThe counselor in 1.g. stated in a letter dated October 6, 2008, that he had\ncontinued to consult with Applicant, and that he claimed he had abstained from alcohol\nfor three months since May 2008 (AE Q). The counselor noted that Applicant made\nsome changes in his daily activities to enhance his chances of being alcohol free. No\nadditional information was provided regarding these changes. \nOn December 8, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counselor stated he consulted with Applicant\non November 21, 2008 and believes Applicant has maintained abstinence for five\nmonths. While Applicant noted he consulted with the counselor every two weeks, there\nwas no documented contact after November 21, 2008.\nAlcohol Consumption\nApplicant has consumed alcohol from 1994 to June 2008 (SOR 2.a.). From late\n1994 to about January 2002, Applicant consumed beer and shots of liquor, drinking\nbetween six and 24 drinks (GE 4). He always drank to intoxication either at bars or\nsocial settings. This pattern of drinking lasted until Applicant was admitted for treatment\nin September 2001. See, 1.a. of the SOR. Though he was not certain, Applicant\nbelieves he did not drink for two years between 2000 and 2002 (Tr. 35). \nApplicant described his alcohol use in 2006 as drinking two or three times a week\nto intoxication until June 2006, when he reported he drank once a week; then, he\nclaimed that from June 2007 to the January 2008, he drank once every other month,\nwhile drinking to intoxication once a month (GE 4). Applicant has not consumed alcohol\nsince June 30, 2008 (Tr. 21).\nIn May 1999 (SOR 2.b.), Applicant was detained for public intoxication, and spent\na night in jail. He noted he was not charged, but acknowledged he had been drinking\n(Tr. 27). Applicant had been drinking in October 2005 (SOR 2.c.) when he was arrested\nfor public drunk. The charge was expunged (Tr. 28). The June 2008 (SOR 2.d.) arrest\nfor public intoxication (Id.) was dismissed when the arresting officer did not appear in\ncourt; Applicant had been drinking before his arrest (Id.).\nThough Applicant believes the public intoxication incident in June 2008 was a\nfactor that helped him stop drinking, he did not know the primary cause (Tr. 48) for\nbecoming abstinent. There was something different about the circumstances that\npersuaded him to stop.\nWhen asked whether he was an alcoholic, Applicant was aware he could be (Id.),\nbut did not think he fit the clinical definition (Tr. 49). Applicant noted that for about 10\nyears he had trouble controlling his consumption (Id.) In the last few years, Applicant\nclaimed he got intoxicated only on a weekend day when he would drink six to 12 drinks\n(Tr. 46). In addition, he stated that any time he found himself in inpatient or outpatient\ntreatment, it was because he volunteered himself for treatment (Tr. 24).\n\n Applicant also consulted with several therapists not listed in the SOR (Tr. 36).\n6\n6\nWhile there may have been some period in 2002 or 2003 that Applicant\nabstained from alcohol (Tr. 35), he did not really have the knowledge or insight into his\nmotivations for using alcohol until he began consultations with the counselor  in SOR\n6\n1.g. \nApplicant\u2019s counselor has given him insight on why he was drinking the way he\nwas drinking (Tr. 27). No additional information was provided. Applicant sees his\ncounselor less frequently since he stopped drinking because about 25% of the sessions\nwere being spent talking about sports (Tr. 38). \nApplicant has not tried Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) because he is not\ncomfortable in the way the organization conducts their meetings, particularly with the\nconstant reference in the group discussions to the word alcohol (Tr. 83). In addition, he\ndoes not need therapy as he has no desire to drink in the future (Tr. 39). Should\nApplicant experience an urge to drink in the future, he will seek support from his\nfiancee, sister, or his mother (Tr. 82). \nApplicant disputes the conclusions made by the government psychologist (SOR\n1.h.) on page two of GE 3 (Tr. 68-75) with respect to his psychological and alcohol\ncondition. He was aware he had a drinking problem and is trying hard to seek\nprofessional help to control it (Tr. 69). Applicant disagreed that the only predictor of\nfuture behavior is past behavior (Tr. 74).\nDrug Involvement\nApplicant used marijuana (SOR 3.a.) approximately 90 to 125 times between\n1995 and 1999. He used the drug with less frequency between 1999 and 2003. After\n1999, his use of the drug was sporadic, ingesting the drug two or three times until 2007\n(Tr. 44). \nIn February 1998 (SOR 3.b.), Applicant was fined $500 for bringing marijuana\ninto the United States (U.S.) (GE 4). Applicant received a related charge for being in\npossession of marijuana (SOR 3.c.) in 1999. Applicant consumed hallucinogenic\nmushrooms (SOR 3.d.) 15 to 20 times in 1998 and 1999, a few times until 2003, and\none time in February 2008. Applicant\u2019s cocaine use (SOR 3.e.) occurred on 20 to 25\noccasions between 1998 and 2005 (GE 4). His last use occurred after he applied for a\nsecurity clearance on September 8, 2003. \nApplicant stopped using cocaine, marijuana, and the other drugs listed in the\nSOR because they triggered his psychological problems such as hallucinations and\nparanoia (Tr. 40-41). He believes he stopped most of his drug use in 2002 (Tr. 25), with\nonly sporadic use since then. His drug use would generally occur during extreme\nalcohol intoxication (Tr. 45), and would bring on depression (Tr. 46). \n\n7\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided several character references from coworkers and friends. A\nstructural engineer (Witness 1, AE A), who has known Applicant for four years, lived\nwith him from 2007 to the spring of 2008. Witness A knew Applicant got intoxicated in\nthe past, but recently Applicant consumes less alcohol and drinks infrequently.\nA project manager (Witness 2, AE B) who had known Applicant personally and\nprofessionally for 10 years, considers Applicant a real professional. \nWitness 3 (AE C), a systems engineer, has known Applicant for three years. In\nthe last nine months the two have become much closer due to their work in a\nsymposium for engineers. Witness C considers Applicant trustworthy.\nWitness 4 (AE D), a coworker for three years, believes Applicant is a very\norganized person. \nWitness 5 (AE E), an engineer who has known Applicant for more than two\nyears, congratulates Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and team-player-attitude. \nWitness 6 (AE F) has known Applicant since December 2006, and considers him\na self-starter. Applicant advised witness F that he has been alcohol free for eight\nmonths. \nWitness 7 (AE G) has known Applicant since August 2007, and recently\nrecommended him for promotion. Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation (AE H) reflects\ngood to outstanding marks for 2006/2007. AE L reflects a middle of the year\nperformance (July 2007) rating at 2.66 out of a maximum 4 rating. AE L also shows\nApplicant\u2019s middle of the year performance rating in July 2008 at 3.05 out of a 4\nmaximum performance rating.\nWitness 9 (AE I) has directed and observed Applicant\u2019s work for four years.\nWitness 9 believes Applicant has made important contributions to various projects.\n AE J contains three certificates of appreciation, one award for attendance, and a\nprestigious certificate of achievement for his contribution to excellent award fee scores. \nApplicant\u2019s friend of 15 years (Witness 10, AE K) believes Applicant is\ntrustworthy. \nAE M and N are daily reminders (aphorisms) Applicant utilizes to help him\nengage in more positive action every day. Toward that end, he applies some teachings\nfrom a revered, motivational leader.\n\n8\nAE O contains e-mails from coworkers expressing their favorable views of\nworking with Applicant. AE P contains a positive reference from Applicant\u2019s future\nfather-in-law (witness 11) who believes Applicant is a thoughtful and trustworthy person.\nIn AE S, Applicant stated that since he stopped consuming alcohol, he has been\nable to enjoy life. He has no desire to make poor decisions in the future. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in order to obtain a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n9\nAnalysis\nPsychological Conditions (PC)\n27. The Concern. \u201cCertain, emotional, mental, and personality conditions can\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not\nrequired for there to be concern under the guideline. A duly qualified mental health\nprofessional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government,\nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information\nunder this guideline. No negative inference concerning the standards in this Guideline\nmay be raised solely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling.\u201d \nThe opinion of a qualified mental health professional as to the existence of a\nmental condition is controlling unless it is based on clearly erroneous evidence.\nAssuming that the evidence establishes the existence of a mental condition, I still must\ndecide whether the condition may impair an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability or\ntrustworthiness. \nWith regard to the psychological condition of personality disorder, not otherwise\nspecified, only the government psychologist rendered this diagnosis. In GE 3, the\npsychologist articulated the procedure he used before delivering his diagnosis. He noted\nthat the medical records were reviewed before the interview, and were also\nincorporated in the overall assessment of Applicant. Next, the psychologist conducted a\nclinical interview of Applicant in which Applicant stated he had established a\nprofessional relationship with the counselor (SOR 1.g.), and that his goal was to remain\nsober for 30 days. \nThe government psychologist noted Applicant\u2019s obsessive-compulsive behavior\n(for which Applicant is still receiving medication). As noted in the factual findings, the\npsychologist conducted the MMPI testing and rendered his conclusions regarding\nApplicant\u2019s lack of insight and minimization. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nspecifically the medical records since 2001, and Applicant\u2019s statements in the various\ninterviews contained in GE 4 and 5, I accept the government\u2019s psychologist\u2019s opinion\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s personality disorder. PC DC \u00b6 28.b. (an opinion by a duly\nqualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition not covered\nunder any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability or trustworthiness)\napplies. \nI have carefully evaluated the mitigating conditions (MC) and determined that\nnone apply. Applicant\u2019s disagreements with the government psychologist\u2019s findings are\nacknowledged, but without substantiation, do not overcome the expert evidence. The\nmedical records, the testing, and the clinical interview establish an adequate foundation\nfor the personality disorder diagnosis. \nThe mitigators have been reviewed, but none are applicable. PC MC \u00b6 29.b. (the\nindividual has voluntarily entered counseling or treatment for a condition that is\n\n10\nmanageable to treatment, with a favorable prognosis by duly qualified health\nprofessional) PC MC \u00b6 29.b. does not apply as the counselor is treating Applicant for his\nalcohol problem, not his personality disorder. Without evidence of treatment or a\nprognosis by a mental health professional, PC MC \u00b6 29.b. is removed as a mitigator. PC\nMC \u00b6 29.c. (recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by,\nor acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous\ncondition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or\nexacerbation) is inapplicable as there is insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s personality\ndisorder is under control. According to the government psychologist, the chances for\nrecurrence of the behavior in the future were expected based on the occurrence of the\ncondition in the past. Having weighed all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony,\nthe PC guideline is resolved against him. \nAlcohol Dependence (AC)\n\u00b6 21. The Concern. \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nAlcohol Consumption (AC) disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 22.a. (alcohol-related\nincidents away from work regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AC DC \u00b6 22.c. (habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and AC DC \u00b6 22.d. (diagnosis\nby a duly qualified medical profession of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence) apply.\nThe record indicates several alcohol-related incidents that satisfy AC DC \u00b6 22.a., as well\nas binge consumption of alcohol that fall within the scope of AC DC \u00b6 22.c. \nSince the mental health professionals disagree on the alcohol diagnosis, I have\nto determine which one carry more weight. To make that decision, I must identify the\nsource material the experts had before they conducted their interviews of Applicant. \nThe licensed counselor for the government (SOR 1.g.), (who became Applicant\u2019s\ntreating counselor) reviewed Applicant\u2019s statements and interviews/interrogatory\nresponses before his clinical interview of Applicant regarding his alcohol problem.\nHowever, there is no indication the counselor had any medical records or that he\nconferred with the psychological consultant he referenced in his report (GE 2). The only\ntest the psychologist conducted was the Alcohol Use Inventory (AUI) questionnaire. The\ncounselor defended his alcohol abuse diagnosis by claiming Applicant met only two of\nthe elements of alcohol dependence. Lacking Applicant\u2019s medical record may have\nbeen the reason for the counselor\u2019s alcohol abuse diagnosis. Having reviewed the\nmedical records and weighed them with the statements, I am unable to accept the\ncounselor\u2019s alcohol abuse diagnosis.\nThe clinical psychologist for the government had the above statements, and\nApplicant\u2019s medical records. Those medical records provided the psychologist with a\n\n11\nmore complete history of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use since before 2001. Though the\npsychologist did not use the AUI questionnaire, he used the MMPI, an inventory\ndesigned to elicit more accurate responses about all elements of Applicant\u2019s character.\nIn conclusion, because the clinical psychologist had medical records and the MMPI\npresenting him with a probative picture of the scope of Applicant\u2019s alcohol use over the\nyears, this added material resulted in a greater foundation for the diagnosis that was\nmade by the psychologist. I accept his diagnosis of Applicant\u2019s alcohol dependence in\nearly remission over the counselor\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol abuse. \nI am unable to apply AC MC \u00b6 23.a. (so much time has passed, or the behavior\nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) in mitigation as Applicant has been alcohol free for only about 9\nmonths. He has consumed alcohol at serious levels since 1994. While his drinking may\nhave decreased over the years, there is very little evidence to substantiate it.\nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s testimony demonstrates his drinking frequency since 2006 was\nmore than he stated in GE 4. Given Applicant\u2019s past history with practically no long-term\nattendance in an aftercare program like AA or other professional therapy, the probability\nof a future recurrence of excessive alcohol consumption in the future is more likely.\nHence, his long history of alcohol dependence continues to carry a negative impact on\nhis judgment and reliability. \nAC MC 23.b. (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence or responsible use) is not applicable because\nApplicant refuses to accept the fact he is an alcoholic. The action he has taken to\novercome his alcohol dependence, and the nine-month period of abstinence is not\nsufficient to apply AC MC \u00b6 23.b \nAC MC \u00b6 23.d. (the individual has successfully completed inpatient treatment or\noutpatient treatment counseling or rehabilitation along with the any required aftercare,\nhas demonstrated a clear an established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence\nin accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of AA\nor a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized alcohol treatment program) is not applicable. Applicant has not been\nabstinent for 12 months. Though he is in counseling, he is not participating in any\ntherapy such as AA. The only prognosis is that of the government psychologist who\nopined that the lack of insight may trigger alcohol problems in the future. Applicant\u2019s\nevidence from his counselor, and his favorable character evidence falls far short of\nmitigating the adverse evidence under the AC guideline. \nDrug Involvement (DI) \n\u00b6 24. The Concern. \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\n\n12\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules or regulations.\u201d \nDI DC \u00b6 25.a. (any drug abuse) and DI DC \u00b6 24.c. (illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia) apply to the circumstances of this case. Applicant\nused marijuana periodically until 1999, and sporadically after that. Most of his use of\nmarijuana, mushrooms, and cocaine ended by 2005. The only drug he Used in 2008\nwere the mushrooms on a one-time basis. I am convinced that most of Applicant\u2019s drug\nuse terminated by 2005 because he realized the drug use was causing psychological\nproblems. In addition, the medical records and interviews in GE 4 and 5 fortify my belief\nthat alcohol was Applicant\u2019s drug of choice. Employing DI MC \u00b6 26.b (a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts, (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are\nused, (3) an appropriate period of abstinence, and a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation), I find in Applicant\u2019s favor under the\nDI guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s\nlife, and a careful consideration of nine variables that comprise whole person model:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation and recurrence. \u00b6 2, p.18 of\nthe Directive.\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating factors in light of all the facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case. I have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s good\njob evaluations, the favorable statements from his coworkers/family, the favorable\ncertificates of appreciation/accomplishments, and his disagreements with the conclusion\nof the government psychologist. However, the character evidence and his statements\ndo not mitigate his psychological condition and his alcohol dependence. What is missing\nhere is a long-term track record of counseling and therapy regarding Applicant\u2019s\npsychological condition and alcohol consumption, coupled with a favorable prognosis. I\nfind Applicant\u2019s drug involvement no longer a security concern.\n\n13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Emotional, mental, personality conditions, Guideline I): AGAINST\nAPPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainstApplicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (alcohol involvement, Guideline G):AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Drug involvement, Guideline H): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDennis J. Sysco, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 18, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\n\n2\nOn November 30, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant has raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s factual findings\nwere based upon substantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is an electronics technician for a\ndefense contractor who has held a security clearance since 1992.  From 1996 until 2002, Applicant\nworked for a contractor in the office of a government agency.\nIn November 2001, workers in Applicant\u2019s branch were asked to clean out a space previously\noccupied by a worker who had since retired.  Among the items cleared out were tool cabinets and\ntools.  The government employee in charge of equipment storage advised the workers that if they\nwanted any of the tools, to take them, since they would otherwise be thrown out.  Applicant and his\nbranch chief each took a tool cabinet.  They transported the cabinets to their homes by means of a\ngovernment van, doing so on company time rather than their off-duty hours.  Applicant also took\ntools, such as pliers, socket drivers, screwdrivers, wrenches, a flashlight, and electrical tape, etc.  \nIn December 2001, Applicant was interviewed about the incident.  He admitted taking the\nproperty and returned it.  His access to Secret Compartmentalized Information (SCI) was terminated,\nand he was fired from his job.  \nIn May 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a member of the Defense Security Service\n(DSS).  He stated in part that when he took the tool cabinet, he thought \u201cthat it would go to\ngovernment auction and be auctioned off, so I was trying to sidestep that procedure.  I thought the\nonly thing I was doing wrong was side stepping the excess procedure.  I know I did wrong, I\napologized to the investigator and other government officials when the items were returned, as well\nas my boss.\u201d  Decision at 4, quoting Government Exhibit 2.\nSubsequently, in his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated, \u201cThe items I took were marked\nfor excess.  It was later explained to me by a family member that the items needed to be taken to a\ndisposal unit on the base and removed from the agency\u2019s books and then they could offer it up for\npublic auction.  I only found out about this procedure after I had removed the items that were being\nexcessed.\u201d  Decision at 5, quoting Answer to SOR.\nDuring his testimony, Applicant acknowledged that, in his 2001 interview, he did not state\nthat the equipment manager had authorized him to take the government property.  He stated that he\ndid not want to the get the person in trouble.  He also stated that at the time he did not believe that\nthe property was actually going to be thrown away.  Decision at 5.  \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s findings in light of the record as a whole and conclude that\nthey are based upon substantial evidence.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1; Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  Therefore, we resolve the first assigned error adversely to\nApplicant.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s analysis is consistent with other record evidence, such as Applicant\u2019s testimony that his employer\n1\nwould not have approved of his delivering the property to his home on company time. \n \nQ: So in other words you falsified your time cards?\nA: I guess so, yes.  Tr. at 68.\n3\nRegarding the second assigned error, we note that, in analyzing the case, the Judge\nconsidered not only the underlying misconduct but also Applicant\u2019s various statements about his\nstate of mind when taking the property.  In that regard, the Judge observed, \u201cApplicant\u2019s inconsistent\nstatements pertaining to his knowledge of procedures for disposing of excess equipment raise\ncredibility issues.  His testimony that he initially did not mention the equipment manager\u2019s name to\nthe security investigators because he did not want to get her into trouble indicates that he had some\nknowledge that taking the tools and tool cabinet home was questionable.\u201d  Decision at 8.  The Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cconsistent with national\nsecurity\u201d for him to have a clearance.  Id.  See  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988).  See also Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDaniel Conway, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 14, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline J and E, as well as his favorable finding under the first\n1\nallegation of Guideline B, are not at issue in this appeal.\n\u201c. . . I purchase annually Lithuanian health insurance for $400.\u201d  Tr. at 83.\n2\n2\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 28, 2009,\nafter the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge made factual errors and\nwhether the Judge erred in her application of the Guideline B mitigating conditions.   Finding no\n1\nharmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a Defense contractor working in Lithuania.  He is married\nto a Lithuanian woman who works for the Lithuanian government.  His wife has a sister who also\nworks for the Lithuanian government.  Applicant\u2019s wife contacts her sister by e-mail once a month\nand by phone once every three or four months.  Applicant\u2019s spouse has two grown children who live\nin Lithuania.  In holding against Applicant, the Judge noted the Lithuanian citizenship of Applicant\u2019s\nwife, her sister, and her children; his wife\u2019s and sister\u2019s employment by the Lithuanian government;\nand that he lives in a house owned by his wife, giving him a financial interest in Lithuania.  The\nJudge also noted that \u201cApplicant has not shown that his sister-in-law\u2019s work . . . does not have\nmilitary or defense implications.\u201d  Decision at 15.    \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  He contends that the Judge erred in finding that he pays $400 a month for health insurance,\nrather than $400 annually, as he testified.   The Board notes that, in the Findings of Fact section of\n2\nher decision, the Judge correctly stated that Applicant\u2019s premium was $400 annually.  The erroneous\nstatement was contained in the Analysis section. Decision at 7, 16.  In light of the entirety of the\nrecord evidence, this error is harmless.  See ISCR 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No.\n03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Daniel S. Conway, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nSerious criminal conduct and personal conduct concerns arise from an indecent\nassault of his stepdaughter in August 2002, but his current situation makes recurrence\nunlikely. He is remarried and living in Lithuania, where he works as a defense contractor\nemployee. Foreign influence concerns persist primarily because he has close bonds\nthrough marriage to Lithuanian resident citizens and his spouse and her sister work for\nthe Lithuanian government. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on March 11, 2004.\nOn May 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline J, Guideline B, and Guideline E that provided the basis for its action to deny\nhim a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\nApril 28, 2009\n\n2\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 16, 2008, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. He subsequently asked for a hearing before an\nadministrative judge, and the case was assigned to me on November 20, 2008. On\nSeptember 29, 2008, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance. With the agreement\nof the parties, on December 8, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for January 7, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Seven government exhibits (Ex. 1-7) and\nten Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-J) were admitted. At the government\u2019s request and with no\nobjection from Applicant, I agreed to take administrative notice of Article 134 of the\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) pertaining to indecent assault, and of two U.S.\nState Department publications for background information about Lithuania: Background\nNote: Lithuania, dated December 2008, and Lithuania, Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices-2007, dated March 11, 2008. Applicant and his spouse also testified,\nas reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on January 28, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J (criminal conduct) and under Guideline E\n(personal conduct) that Applicant was arrested in August 2002 and found guilty at a\nsummary court-martial of indecent assault, in violation of Article 134 of the UCMJ (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 3.a); that he was arrested in April 1993 and charged with domestic battery\n(dismissed) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 3.a); and that he arrested in December 1990 for criminal\ntrespass and simple assault, and pleaded guilty to the assault charge (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 3.a).\nDOHA alleged only under Guideline E that because of the August 2002 indecent\nassault, the U.S. military had intended to adjudicate his security clearance, although his\naffiliation with the military was terminated before any final resolution (SOR \u00b6 3.b). Under\nGuideline B (foreign influence), Applicant was alleged to currently reside in Lithuania\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a), and to be in a domestic relationship with a Lithuanian resident citizen\n(SOR \u00b6 2.b), who works for the Lithuanian government (SOR \u00b6 2.c).  Applicant admitted\nthe allegations with explanations, and offered in mitigation that he had made national\nsecurity his primary concern over his 27-year career. After considering the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old database designer for, and trainer of, a military\nsimulation application that replicates battlefield conditions in the computer to train\nmilitary staffs (Tr. 41). He has worked for a U.S. defense contractor since February\n2004 following his retirement from the U.S. military. He held a secret-level security\nclearance since 1979, most recently renewed in August 1995 (Exs. 1, 7, Tr. 89).\n\n3\nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. military under a delayed entry program in\nNovember 1978 (Tr. 42). He entered on active duty in May 1979, and was stationed on\na ship equipped with nuclear weapons that was ported overseas (Tr. 44). In November\n1979, he married his first wife. Both were only 18, and they had no children before they\ndivorced in February 1982 (Ex. 1, Tr. 47). In late May 1982, Applicant married his\nsecond wife, just before he completed his three-year enlistment term and was\ndischarged from active duty (Exs. 1, B). \nAfter he was discharged, Applicant realized that he wanted to continue in the\nmilitary. He enlisted in another branch of the service under a delayed entry program\nbecause it offered more opportunity for education and promotion (Tr. 45). Following his\nentry on active duty in November 1982, he had a distinguished career, which included a\ntour in Southwest Asia during Desert Storm for which he received the Bronze Star (Tr.\n46). He progressed through the ranks to sergeant first class (E-7) by July 1993 (Ex. A).\nAs a fire support noncommissioned officer, Applicant routinely handled classified\ninformation without incident. A brigadier general (now retired), who served first as a\nbattalion commander from 1996 to 1997 and then as commander of the field artillery\nregiment from 2000 to 2001, considered Applicant an \u201cexceptional paratrooper.\u201d He\nobserved Applicant\u2019s duty performance to be \u201cexceptional in all aspects,\u201d and his\nreliability and trustworthiness to be beyond reproach (Ex. G). \nApplicant had problems at home. While Applicant and his second wife were\ntogether, Applicant was twice arrested, once on domestic charges. In December 1990,\nApplicant was arrested for criminal trespass and simple assault after an incident\ninvolving his then sister-in-law\u2019s ex-boyfriend. Applicant had accompanied his sister-in-\nlaw to her ex-boyfriend\u2019s home to retrieve some of her possessions. When he saw his\nsister-in-law being manhandled by her former boyfriend, Applicant ran into the house\nand pushed him away. Applicant asserts that all charges were dismissed against him\n(Ex. 2, Answer, Tr. 49), and the government presented no evidence to show otherwise.\nIn April 1993, Applicant was arrested for domestic battery against his spouse. During an\nargument between them, their dogs began fighting each other. Applicant\u2019s spouse, who\nhad picked up an electric cattle prod to stop the dogs, struck Applicant in the back. He\nturned and kicked his spouse in the chest and right shoulder area, leaving bruises.\nApplicant called the police, and he was arrested. He was released the next day without\nformal charges being filed (Ex. 3, Tr. 51). He denies striking her at any other time during\ntheir marriage (Tr. 72). He divorced her in October 1996 after 14 years of marriage (Ex.\n1) because the marriage had been abusive physically and emotionally for him. Following\nhis divorce, he discovered that during the first seven years of their marriage, his ex-wife\nhad still been legally married to her first husband. Applicant sought and obtained an\nannulment of the marriage after the divorce (Tr. 48).\nOn July 28, 1994, Applicant completed a National Agency Questionnaire (DD\nForm 398-2) in renewal of his secret-level clearance. He listed his arrests for\ntrespassing in December 1990 and in April 1993 for physical abuse (Ex. 2). His\nclearance was renewed in August 1995 (Ex. 7).\n\nApplicant\u2019s spouse at the time told investigators that she had been contacted by her first sergeant\n1\nto take her daughter to the hospital because Applicant had assaulted her daughter. She called her first\nsergeant back and then her daughter, who in the presence of a military chaplain, told her Applicant had\nfondled her. Applicant\u2019s spouse also indicated to investigators that Applicant had informed her on the way\nhome from a movie that he had assaulted her younger daughter and that she had to take her daughter to the\nMP station (Ex. 5). It is unclear whether Applicant broached the subject with his spouse or whether she\nconfronted him about it after speaking to her daughter. It is difficult to believe that Applicant\u2019s spouse would\nhave gone to the movies with him if she had just learned that her daughter had been assaulted.  Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent recollection is that after he came back from his shift, he was asked by his spouse whether he had done\nit, and he told her that he had (Tr. 55).\n4\nIn late November 1996, Applicant entered into a third marriage. His new wife was\non active duty in the U.S. military. She had two daughters, then ages 10 and 12, and a\nson age 15 from a previous marriage (Tr. 52-53). Applicant, who had no experience with\nchildren, engaged in \u201croughhousing\u201d with his stepdaughters on occasion (Tr. 54), and\nsometimes touched them inappropriately by accident as he wrestled with them. They\nfelt uncomfortable at times (Ex. 5), but there is no indication that they let him know that.\nIn August 2002, Applicant\u2019s 16-year-old stepdaughter asked him to draw a fake\ntattoo on her back. As she lay on a pillow across his chest, he \u201cgot excited\u201d (Tr. 54) and\ninappropriately fondled her breast. Twice she left to check on the progress of the tattoo,\nonly to return for him to finish the drawing. Each time, he \u201cgroped\u201d her breast for a few\nmore minutes. The last time, his actions were observed by Applicant\u2019s other\nstepdaughter, who had briefly entered the room. Neither she nor the victim told\nApplicant at the time that his behavior was inappropriate. After he finished the drawing,\nhe returned to work (Ex. 5, Tr. 53-54).\nThe sequence of events that led to the incident being discovered is not clearly\nset out in the available record,  but Applicant did not deny to his spouse or to military\n1\ninvestigators that he had inappropriately touched his stepdaughter\u2019s breast (Ex. 5).\nDuring an investigation, Applicant\u2019s younger stepdaughter was asked whether Applicant\nhad ever placed his hand on his breast previously. She responded only when they were\nroughhousing. She admitted that she had not told Applicant to stop fondling her and that\nshe did not think he would do it again. Applicant\u2019s older stepdaughter was interviewed\nas well, and she indicated she had seen Applicant\u2019s left hand on her sister\u2019s breast, and\nshe left without saying anything. She believed Applicant saw her, but he did not remove\nhis hand from her sister\u2019s breast. She denied Applicant had ever touched her\ninappropriately at any time (Ex. 5).\nDuring his interview, Applicant acknowledged his misconduct to the investigator.\nHe indicated that he had asked his younger stepdaughter repeatedly at the time\nwhether it felt good and she responded, \u201cYes.\u201d He averred that his stepdaughter did not\ntell him to stop, but that he \u201cshould have known better.\u201d He denied having engaged in\nsimilar behavior in the past other than during some tickling and roughhousing. When\nasked about how he was treated during his interview, Applicant responded, \u201cWith more\nrespect than I deserve.\u201d Applicant\u2019s younger stepdaughter was re-interviewed a couple\n\nUnder Article 16 of the UCMJ, a summary court-marital is presided over by one commissioned officer\n2\n(see Tr. 86). The investigating officer felt that the testimony provided by Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter was\nsomewhat unreliable and not supportive of referral to a higher level courts-martial (Ex. E). Moreover, if\nApplicant was not represented by counsel at his summary court-martial, the finding of guilty of indecent assault\nwould not constitute a criminal conviction. See Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U.S. 25 (1975).\n5\nof days later. She maintained she did not want Applicant to go to jail but that he needed\nto go to counseling (Ex. 5).\nApplicant began living apart from his spouse and her daughters immediately (Tr.\n82).  He was ordered to undergo one year of counseling, which began in or before mid-\nSeptember 2002 as couples counseling with only his spouse (Ex. 7, Tr. 57). After six\nmonths, he moved back home and he began family sessions with his spouse and\nstepdaughter (Tr. 57-58, 82). Applicant learned that he had to separate the roles of\nparent and friend, and he should have had a parental relationship with his\nstepdaughters, that it was inappropriate to roughhouse with teenage girls, and that he\nnever should have gotten into a level of intimacy with his stepdaughter that he did (Tr.\n79-81).\nAs a result of the military\u2019s investigation, a charge of indecent assault was filed\nagainst Applicant (Exs. 4, 5). His access to classified information was not suspended by\nhis command pending the outcome, although the clearance adjudicating authority was\ninformed of the indecent assault charge on September 19, 2002 (Ex. 7). Applicant\ncontinued to serve as a senior NCO where he was rated by his superior as one of his\nmost capable staff members. Applicant handled and safeguarded classified intelligence\nand targeting information on a daily basis, in many cases keeping his officers in line on\nensuring information was properly secured (Ex. H).\nApplicant appeared before a summary court-martial on the indecent assault\ncharge in November 2002 (Tr. 78).  He was found guilty, and he was ordered to forfeit\n2\n$2,166 pay for one month and was restricted to his apartment for 60 days (Ex. 5, Tr.\n56). An officer (now retired), who was present at the summary courts-marital\nproceedings, attested to Applicant being \u201ccandid, forthright, and remorseful in publicly\nacknowledging his error.\u201d This officer considers Applicant\u2019s mistake an anomaly in an\notherwise spotless military career, and he continues to hold Applicant in high regard\n(Ex. H).\nEffective late November 2003, Applicant retired from the Army after 21 years of\notherwise honorable service (Exs. 6, A). He received many awards during his military\ncareer, which, in addition to the Bronze Star Medal include the Meritorious Service\nMedal, the Army Commendation Medal (5  award) and the Army Achievement Medal\nth\n(8  Award) (Ex. A). Applicant terminated his affiliation with the U.S. military before the\nth\nsecurity clearance adjudicating authority acted on its intent to review Applicant\u2019s\nongoing eligibility for access to classified information (Ex. 7).\n\n6\nApplicant returned to his home state with his family in August 2003, and in about\nJanuary 2004 (Ex. D) he began voluntary counseling at a military health center to learn\nmore about himself. Through individual counseling sessions twice a month for almost a\nyear, he learned how to maintain a proper relationship as a parent (Tr. 58-59). To\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge, he was not given any formal diagnosis nor was he told he was at\nrisk to re-offend (Tr. 87).\nIn February 2004, he began working as an analyst for his current employer on a\nmilitary installation. On March 11, 2004, he completed his SF 86, listing the summary\ncourt-martial proceedings for the indecent assault in August 2002. He also responded\n\u201cYes\u201d to both questions under module 19 concerning any consultation with a mental\nhealth professional or with another health care provider about a mental health related\ncondition in the last seven years, and whether it involved marital, family, or grief\ncounseling not related to any violence by him (Ex. 1).\nFrom February 2004 to April 2006, Applicant\u2019s primary duty for his employer was\nto train the user community on the company\u2019s tactical simulation software. Applicant\nearned the trust of the user community, and kept his supervisors informed of issues that\ncould have a negative impact on the overall quality of the software or on the ability of\nthe user community to effectively employ the simulation. A senior analyst, who is most\nfamiliar with Applicant\u2019s work at the company\u2019s national simulation center from February\n2004 April 2006, does not doubt Applicant\u2019s ability to protect sensitive or classified\ninformation (Ex. I). It is unclear whether this analyst has any knowledge of Applicant\noutside of work.\nIn April 2006, Applicant was transferred by his employer to Lithuania as part of a\nfour-person defense modernization team to assist the Lithuanian military on a project\nsponsored, managed, and funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (Ex. J, Tr. 61). He\nroutinely works with members of the Lithuanian military (Tr. 82). The contract under\nwhich the team is in Lithuania is up for renewal annually in late November (Tr. 90, 99),\nand the company decided that Applicant will be the person to continue the contract,\nregardless of the issue with his clearance (Tr. 100). The manager of the company\u2019s\nteam in Lithuania has worked with Applicant since January 2007 on a near-daily basis.\nHe attests that Applicant lives within his means, has superb work habits, and handles\nsensitive proprietary and restricted distribution information conscientiously and\nprecisely. A former U.S. military officer himself, he \u201chas not seen or sensed the\nbehaviors or conditions that could cause [him] to question [Applicant\u2019s] loyalty to the\nUnited States or flag him as a security risk\u201d (Ex. J). While this professional colleague\nexpressed his trust in Applicant \u201cto tell the truth even when it could be perceived as\nreflecting negatively on him personally,\u201d (Ex. J), it is unclear whether he knows of the\n2002 indecent assault. He confirms that Applicant has not handled any classified\ninformation since he has been in Lithuania but a secret level clearance is required by\nthe contract in anticipation that they will work with NATO or another country that does\nrequire a clearance for exercises (Tr. 85). \n\nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified they had been friends for a long time. She met Applicant\u2019s ex-wife when\n3\nshe was visiting him in Lithuania in November 2006 (Tr. 122).\nW hen asked specifically about what he told her, Applicant\u2019s spouse testified, in part:\n4\nHe went home between shifts and his stepdaughter [name omitted] asked him to draw a\ntattoo on her shoulder. And she was laying on his lap and she offered to open her bra, just\nto be easier to draw, and she did that and then at that moment he was holding her and then\nhis arm was, slipped down by the breast and after he finished that tattoo, she went to the\nbathroom to see what this looks like and asked him to do another one, so it was not only one\ntattoo (Tr. 117).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse used the word \u201cslipped,\u201d which could indicate accidental touching as opposed to groping,\nbut she has also read the documents about the incident that her spouse received (Tr. 117-18). She was also\naware that Applicant had hit his second wife after \u201chis wife used some tool which they use for dogs, to stop,\nand put that power on him and his body, the reaction, he hit her. . . .\u201d (Tr. 118).\n7\nApplicant has a Lithuanian immigration card that he has to renew each year to\nremain legally in the country beyond 90 days (Tr. 69). As part of the immigration\nprocess, he is required to have health insurance, which he purchases annually at a cost\nof $400 (Tr. 83).\nIn May 2006, Applicant met his current spouse, who is a native citizen of\nLithuania. She ended up sitting at his table in a local outdoor caf\u00e9 in Lithuania and they\neventually became friends  and then a couple (Tr. 60, 121). In about November 2006,\n3\nApplicant\u2019s current spouse met his now former wife when the latter came to Lithuania to\nvisit him. Applicant informed his current spouse about his abuse of his stepdaughter (Tr.\n122).  In May 2007, Applicant\u2019s third wife was granted a decree of divorce in the U.S.\n4\n(Tr. 60, 66). In April 2008, after more than 26 years of marriage, Applicant\u2019s current\nspouse divorced her husband (Tr. 112), and she and Applicant married in Lithuania in\nJune 2008 (Tr. 64, 70. 107). In October or November 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse applied\nfor U.S. lawful permanent residence status (\u201ca green card\u201d) (Tr. 123). Applicant is not\nallowed to apply for permanent permission to live in Lithuania until after he has resided\nin the country for five years (Tr. 125). Applicant and his spouse reside in a flat that she\nowns in Lithuania (Tr. 62), which is a garden property of less than one acre (Tr. 62-63).\nShe also owns in full (Tr. 115) or in part (Tr. 65) a flat in which she previously lived\nduring her marriage to her ex-husband. She plans to give the property to her daughter\n(Tr. 116).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse has a master\u2019s degree in mathematics. Before their deaths,\nher father was a published academic and university professor, her mother worked as a\ncomputer programmer in the early days of the information technology field (Tr. 110-11).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse has been employed as a database programmer for the Lithuanian\ngovernment for over the past nine years (Tr. 61, 64, 66-67, 108-09). She is the only\nperson who does her particular job (Tr. 108). She had previously owned her own\ncompany in Lithuania, but she transferred ownership to her now ex-husband when she\nstarted working for the Lithuanian government (Tr. 113-14). Her ex-husband attended\n\n8\nher wedding to Applicant (Tr. 70), but they only have contact when necessary for\nbusiness (Tr. 114). He is a dean of a university in Lithuania (Tr. 71, 112).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse has one sibling, an unmarried sister, who previously worked\nas an accountant for the company Applicant\u2019s spouse founded (Tr. 97-98, 111). In\nOctober or November 2008, her sister, who has a degree in mathematics as well, began\nworking for a ministry of the Lithuanian government (Tr. 63-64, 96, 111-12). Applicant\u2019s\nspouse has email contact with her sister once a month and they speak on the telephone\nonce every three or four months (Tr. 121).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse has two grown children (a son and a daughter both in their\nearly 20's) from her previous marriage (Tr. 68, 113). Her son is currently a student, but\nhe also works for his father in the company that she founded. Her son lives in a small\napartment that she owns (Tr. 115). Her daughter is studying art and theater in Lithuania\n(Tr. 69, 113). Applicant and his spouse had her sister and children over to their place on\nDecember 24, 2008 (Tr. 121).\nApplicant\u2019s mother came from the U.S. for his wedding in Lithuania (Tr. 70). As of\nMarch 2004 at least, she was still living in Applicant\u2019s home state (Ex. 1). Applicant has\none bank account in Lithuania into which he transfers funds from his account in the U.S.\nHe uses the Lithuanian account to pay bills there (Tr. 62). Applicant pays taxes in the\nU.S. on his income (Tr. 71). All his financial investments and retirement accounts are in\nthe U.S. (Tr. 71). He owns no real estate (Tr. 91). Applicant holds life memberships in\nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion organizations through local\nchapters in his home state in the U.S. (Ex. C).\nApplicant has discussed moving from Lithuania with his spouse (Tr. 91). In the\nevent the present contract which employs Applicant in Lithuania is not renewed,\nApplicant plans on remaining with his employer even if he has to relocate. He earns an\nannual salary of $160,000 USD (Tr. 88), while his spouse\u2019s monthly salary is between\n$1,600 and $1,700 per month (Tr. 116). He testified that she wants to work in Lithuania\nabout five more years so that she can be eligible for retirement and medical benefits (Tr.\n92, 94), but she indicated she would not mind leaving Lithuania with him for his job (Tr.\n119, 126). Both Applicant and his spouse testified to planning to live in the U.S. at some\npoint (Tr. 93, 119).  \nAfter reviewing the U.S. State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices-2007\u2013Lithuania and Background Note: Lithuania, I take administrative notice\nof the following facts:\nLithuania is a constitutional, multiparty, parliamentary democracy with an\nethnically homogeneous populous of about 3.4 million. Oriented toward the west and\nChristianity from the 14  century, Lithuania retained its sovereignty until 1795 when a\nth\njoint Lithuanian-Polish state was dissolved and over 90% of Lithuanian was\nincorporated into the Russian Empire. After World War I, Lithuania was declared a\nparliamentary republic, but Soviet pressure and a complicated international situation led\n\n9\nto Soviet domination. In August 1940, Lithuania was proclaimed a Soviet Socialist\nRepublic under totalitarian rule with Sovietization of the economy and culture.\nLithuanians were either killed or deported to Siberia and other remote parts of the\nSoviet Union while Russian immigration into Lithuania was encouraged as a way of\nintegrating the country into the U.S.S.R. With the advent of social and political reforms\nin the Soviet Union, Lithuania proclaimed its independence in March 1990, being the\nfirst Soviet republic to do so. Lithuania joined the United Nations in September 1991,\nthe World Trade Organization in May 2001, NATO in March 2004, and the European\nUnion in May 2004.\nThe U.S. never recognized the Soviet claim to Lithuania, and the two countries\nhave had continuous diplomatic relations since 1922. Lithuania has been a staunch ally\nof the U.S. in the war on terror, contributing to military operations in Afghanistan and\nIraq. It also participates in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Lithuania\nhas also been a strong supporter of U.S. objectives in promoting democracy in the\nformer Soviet republics. Lithuanian national policy recognizes the primacy of NATO as\nthe guarantor of security in Europe. Its foreign policy is based on protecting itself and\nthe Eastern European region from what it perceives as an expansionist Russia.\nLithuania has privatized nearly all formerly state-owned enterprises, including the\ngas and power companies. The railway and post remain state-owned. More than 79% of\nthe economy\u2019s output is generated by the private sector. At the end of the third quarter\nof 2008, Lithuania had accumulated direct foreign investment of $12.8 billion, with U.S.\ninvestments amounting to $294 million. Lithuania has enjoyed most-favored-nation\nstatus with the U.S. since December 1991. Lithuania\u2019s national currency is pegged to\nthe euro. Adoption of the euro has been postponed due to high inflation in Lithuania.\nThe U.S. State Department reports that the Lithuanian government generally\nrespected the human rights of its citizens in 2007. Government officials were\ncooperative and responsive to domestic and international investigations of alleged\nviolations of human rights. There were some issues of poor prison conditions,\nwidespread domestic violence against women and abuse of children, some trafficking in\nwomen and girls, and increased reports of racial or ethnic violence and intolerance. The\ngovernment was committed to children\u2019s rights and welfare, investigating complaints of\nabuse, but insufficient assistance was provided to combat the problem of child abuse,\nincluding physical abuse of children in orphanages. While the police cooperated with\nother European governments on several trafficking cases, Lithuania remained a source,\ntransit, and destination point for trafficking in women and girls from the most vulnerable\nsocial groups and ethnic minorities. Police corruption and abuse of power were reported\nwith the officers being subjected to disciplinary actions.  There were fewer complaints\nfrom the previous year of alleged arbitrary interference with privacy involving the\nprocessing of personal data and the government did not restrict access to the Internet\nor engage in improper monitoring of e-mail correspondence. The government respected\nthe freedom to associate generally while continuing to ban the Communist Party and\nother organizations associated with the former Soviet regime. Complaints of societal\ndiscrimination and racial and/or ethnic intolerance, including hate crimes, were\n\n10\ninvestigated, but sanctions were often insufficient. Lithuania respected the right of its\ncitizens to move freely within the country, to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to\nrepatriate. Periodic free and fair elections were held on the basis of universal suffrage,\nyet officials found guilty of corruption were often punished with minor penalties.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the\nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions,\nwhich are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n11\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern about criminal conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe government alleged that Applicant pleaded guilty to simple assault following\nan incident in December 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant, the sole source of the information\nabout that incident, does not deny that he entered his sister-in-law\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s\nhome and pushed the ex-boyfriend away from his sister-in-law before chasing him out\nof the house.  Yet, he explained his conduct was in response to aggressive action from\nthis boyfriend toward his sister-in-law, and that the judge dismissed the charge. On his\n1994 NAQ, in his Answer to the SOR, and again at his hearing (Tr. 49), Applicant has\nconsistently denied that he was convicted of any charge. The government presented no\nevidence to show otherwise. Even in the absence of a conviction, conduct criminal in\nnature can be security disqualifying under AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d But it was minor in nature, in defense of his sister-in-law, and\nhappened so long ago to be of little current significance (see AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time\nhas elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d).\nAG \u00b6 31(c) clearly applies to the 1993 domestic assault. Again, although\nApplicant was not convicted of any crime, he does not dispute that he kicked his ex-wife\nin the chest after she hit him with a cattle prod. The vehemence of his reaction is likely\nattributable to anger with his ex-wife and not to years of hand-to-hand training as he\nsuggests. But at least as to physical abuse not sexual in nature, it appears to be\nisolated in nature, and he took responsibility by calling the police. AG \u00b6 32(a) would\nappear to apply to that offense as well.\nApplicant\u2019s sexual assault of his 16-year-old stepdaughter in August 2002 raises\nconsiderable criminal conduct concerns. If his contemporaneous account to the Army\ninvestigator is accurate, he \u201cgroped\u201d his stepdaughter at least three separate times, and\n\n12\nfor several minutes each time, on that occasion in August 2002. He reportedly asked\nher repeatedly if it felt good, and she responded affirmatively with no request to stop.\nHe admits he breached the relationship of trust with his stepdaughter for his own\ngratification, and it is no less egregious because of any verbal acquiescence on her part\n(assuming she told him it felt good) or her failure to remove herself from the situation.\nEven if Applicant did not realize before counseling that he should not have wrestled or\nroughhoused with his teenage stepdaughters, he knew or should have known that he\ncrossed the line when he fondled the 16-year-old\u2019s breast. Furthermore, while he told\nthe military investigator that he did not sense any fear in his stepdaughter at the time\n(Ex. 5), he indicated that she might have been scared. The evidence suggests a level of\nintimidation in his relationship with his stepdaughters that likely led them to keep silent\nwhen they should have spoken out. It also shows a careless disregard for their\nemotional well-being. He was punished by summary court-martial rather than a special\nor general courts-marital, but it does not diminish the security implications of criminal\nconduct that falls under both AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c).\nWhen asked by the military investigator whether either of her daughters had\ncomplained about any inappropriate touches by Applicant, Applicant\u2019s spouse\nresponded, \u201cYes, when they roughhouse.\u201d Applicant asserts that any previous touching\nof intimate areas in that context was accidental. Even so, the seriousness of the sexual\nassault in August 2002 precludes consideration of AG \u00b6 32(a) in mitigation.\nAs to whether the available record supports application of AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d\nacceptance of responsibility with an appropriate expression of remorse is required for\nsuccessful rehabilitation. Applicant admitted to his spouse that he inappropriately\ntouched her daughter, and he suggested to her that they go to the military police. When\ninterviewed by the military investigator, Applicant indicated that he had repeatedly\nasked his stepdaughter whether it felt good and she responded affirmatively. However,\nwhen asked at his hearing whether he said anything to his stepdaughter at the time, he\nresponded, \u201cDuring that process I said does this feel okay? And I didn\u2019t get any\nresponse.\u201d (Tr. 54). Any suggestion that she might have enjoyed the contact would be\nan improper attempt to shift some of the responsibility to her. At the same time,\nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator that he should have known better, and that\nhe was being treated by the investigator with more respect than he deserved.\nFurthermore, he went to counseling for the year that it was ordered, and was\nallowed to continue to perform his military duties, including those involving access to\nclassified information. By all accounts of record, he executed his responsibilities in an\nexemplary manner, and he retired honorably from the military. Following his retirement,\nhe sought additional counseling voluntarily through a military family advocacy office\nbecause he felt he needed to learn more about himself (Tr. 58-59). Applicant was\nunable to obtain the records of his counseling (see Ex. D), and there are no formal\n\n13\nprognosis or clinician assessments available that could corroborate his claim of insight\ninto his behavior and the triggers that led to the inappropriate contact with his\nstepdaughter. However, more than six years have passed since the assault, and his\ncurrent personal situation is not conducive to any recurrence. He moved to Lithuania for\nwork in about April 2006, and is now married to a woman with two adult children of her\nown. There is no evidence that he has any ongoing contact with his stepdaughters, or\nany other female minors.\nGuideline E \u2014Personal Conduct\nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant reacted in 1990 to prevent harm to his sister-in-law. That incident does\nnot now cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Yet, Applicant\nexercised poor judgment that implicates the general security concerns of AG \u00b6 15 when\nhe assaulted his ex-wife in 1993 and his stepdaughter in 2002. Domestic assault and\nsexual assault of a minor family member could negatively influence others\u2019 opinions of\nhim. AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging\nin activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing,\u201d applies.\nThe government failed to make its case for additional personal conduct concerns\nseparately arising from any intent of the military adjudicators to adjudicate Applicant\u2019s\nclearance but for the fact that he separated before any formal action was taken (SOR \u00b6\n3.b). The evidence shows Applicant made the decision to retire on or before April 22,\n2003 (Ex. 6). The military could have immediately suspended his access back in\nSeptember 2002 but chose not to do so.\nWhile there has been no recurrence of any assault since 2002,  AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply\nfor the same reasons that AG \u00b6 32(a) did not mitigate the criminal conduct concerns.\nBut his subsequent counseling, including additional voluntary sessions in 2004, satisfies\nAG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or facts that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\n\n14\nAs for potential vulnerability concerns, it is not clear that the work colleagues at\nhis present employment are aware of his past assaultive behavior, but there is also no\nindication that he is acting to conceal that information. He disclosed the 1990 criminal\ntrespass and 1993 physical abuse charges on his July 1994 NAQ and the August 2002\nindecent assault on his March 2004 SF 86. He initially informed his current spouse\nabout the 2002 offense in November 2006, within months of their first meeting, and she\nhas read the military investigator\u2019s report that was sent to Applicant in preparation for\nhis January 2009 security clearance hearing. AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken\npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress,\u201d applies in mitigation.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has lived in Lithuania since April 2006, where he works on a DoD-\nsponsored project to assist the Lithuanian military. The month after he arrived, he had a\ncasual encounter with a Lithuanian native citizen, whom he eventually married in June\n2008. Through her, he has bonds of affection and/or obligation to other Lithuanian\ncitizens, most notably her two grown children, but also her sister, with whom she has\nonce monthly e-mail contact. As recently as December 2008, Applicant and his spouse\nhosted her sister and children for the holiday. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family\nmember, business, or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections\nto a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology, and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information,\u201d and AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of\nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d apply.\nApplicant does not himself own any foreign property that would implicate AG \u00b6\n7(e), \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to\n\n15\nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d His military retirement, salary, and\ninvestment income, are all in the U.S. While he has a Lithuanian bank account out of\nwhich he pays his expenses in Lithuania, the funds he has on deposit are transferred\nfrom his primary account in a U.S. financial institution. Yet, he has an interest through\nhis spouse in the home in which he lives with her in Lithuania, so AG \u00b6 7(e) applies. The\naggregate value of her real property in Lithuania was not set forth in the record. She\nowns some small parcels of land, a very small apartment in which her son lives, and a\nflat where she had previously resided with her ex-husband that she plans on giving to\nher daughter (Tr. 115-16). But her foreign property interests cannot be considered\nminimal since she provides shelter for herself, Applicant, and also her son.\nSince the risk of undue foreign influence exists largely, although not solely,\nbecause of his marriage to a foreign national, Applicant cannot satisfy the first prong of\nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Moreover, his spouse\u2019s and\nhis sister-in-law\u2019s employments with the Lithuanian government increase the risk that he\ncould be placed in the untenable position of having to choose between them and their\ninterests and U.S. interests. Although there is nothing about his spouse\u2019s work in the tax\narea that is particularly of concern, she is also the only person who does her job, and\nshe relies on the Lithuanian government for her salary. Applicant has not shown that his\nsister-in-law\u2019s work, albeit as an accountant, does not have military or defense\nimplications.\nIn assessing the general concerns underlying Guideline B and the potential\napplicability of AG \u00b6 8(a) in particular, the country at issue and whether it is known to\ntarget U.S. protected information or is associated with terrorism, must be considered. A\nformer Soviet republic because of a complicated international situation and Soviet\npressure, Lithuania has been aligned to the West historically. The U.S. and Lithuania\nhave had diplomatic relations since 1922, even when it was a member of the Soviet\nUnion. Lithuania is a committed NATO member and supporter of the U.S. in its fight\nagainst terrorism. A close relationship between the U.S. and Lithuania is evidenced by\nApplicant\u2019s work with the Lithuanian military on a project sponsored by the U.S. Defense\nDepartment. The country is not known to aggressively target U.S. classified information\nor sensitive proprietary information for its own gain. Ongoing problems with official\ncorruption and minor sanctions for abuses raise some concerns about selective\nenforcement of the law, but Lithuania generally respects the human rights of its citizens.\nGovernment officials have been cooperative and responsive to domestic and\ninternational investigations of alleged violations of human rights. Relations between\nnations can shift dramatically and unexpectedly, however. Given the considerable ties\nApplicant has to Lithuania at this time, and the employments of his spouse and her\nsister for the Lithuanian government, Applicant cannot fully satisfy AG \u00b6 8(a).\n\n16\nAG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships in the U.S., that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest,\u201d requires a comparative assessment of the obligations and loyalties owed to\nthe foreign person, government, or country and to the U.S. Applicant has no political\naffinity or loyalty to the Lithuanian government but his personal ties to Lithuania cannot\nfairly be characterized as \u201cso minimal.\u201d At the same time, his 24 years of active duty\nservice for the U.S. military carries considerable weight in determining whether he has\n\u201cdeep and longstanding relationships in the U.S.\u201d that he can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. The absence of strong familial ties in\nthe U.S. (other than perhaps his mother) does not preclude application of AG \u00b6 8(b),\nespecially where he has shown a level of dedication and commitment to the military.\nEven now, he intends to relocate if necessary to keep his job, knowing that his spouse\nwould like to remain employed in Lithuania for five more years. His lifetime\nmemberships in the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion are additional\nindicators of the significance of U.S. military service to him. Although he owns no\nproperty in the U.S., he has financial investments (including his military retirement) in\nthe U.S. His spouse has applied for U.S. permanent residency status, presumably\nunder his sponsorship. But it is unclear whether he intends to reside permanently in the\nU.S. He has been selected by his employer to continue on the project if it is extended in\nLithuania. When asked about his future plans, Applicant testified that if the contract was\nnot renewed, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a tough decision . . . somehow she has to find a way that\nshe will maintain that retirement and go with [him].\u201d (Tr. 93). While he would not\nconsider taking a job on the Lithuanian economy because of the income from his\npresent job and the fact that it leads to other jobs in the U.S., he indicated that they\neventually want to live in the U.S. \u201cfor a period or two.\u201d (Tr. 94). In light of his\nconsiderable ties to Lithuania at this point (which also include medical benefits for which\nhe pays $400 per month), I cannot apply AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that she does not have close and continuing contact\nwith her ex-husband (Tr. 114), and that she has closer ties with friends than with her\nsister (Tr. 111). Yet, her son works for his father in the company that she founded and\nApplicant has contact with her ex-husband at times for necessary business. Although\nshe has only monthly contact with her sister, they share enough of a familial bond for\nApplicant\u2019s spouse to invite her sister to her home for holiday celebrations, including in\nDecember 2008. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so causal\nand infrequent that there is less likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation,\u201d does not apply. AG \u00b6 8(d), \u201cthe foreign contacts and activities are on\nU.S. Government business or are approved by the cognizant security authority,\u201d applies\nin limited part, in that the government alleged as a concern Applicant\u2019s residency in\nLithuania (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant came to Lithuania for his defense-contractor\nemployment and his continued residency in and of itself does not raise independent\nconcerns given he is still working on a project with the Lithuanian military with the\napproval of the U.S. Defense Department.\n\n17\nAs for the value of his financial stake in Lithuania, Applicant\u2019s salary is paid by a\nU.S. company. His annual income of $160,000 per year plus his U.S. military retirement\nand other financial investments are all from U.S. sources. His spouse earns about\n$1,600 to $1,700 per month in Lithuania. The record contains no information about the\ndollar values of her real estate in Lithuania, but I cannot fully apply AG \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value\nor routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interest is such that they\nare unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure the individual\u201d), in light of his overall ties to Lithuania. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s judgment is called into serious question because of his indecent\nassault of his stepdaughter in 2002. He betrayed the trust of his stepdaughter by his\nactions, and the negative security implications are not easily overcome. On the other\nhand, security clearance decisions are not intended to punish for past misconduct.\nRather, they involve an assessment of risk to security, and Applicant\u2019s present situation\nis not amenable to a recurrence. Applicant\u2019s counseling and the passage of six years\nwithout recurrence are sufficient to mitigate the criminal conduct and personal conduct\nconcerns.\nApplicant\u2019s current employment in Lithuania was sanctioned by the U.S. But his\nties to Lithuania are beyond residency and employment. With his relationship and then\nmarriage to a Lithuanian national, who has substantial connections to Lithuania through\nproperty ownership and government employment, Applicant has placed himself in the\nuntenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family member and\nthe interests of the U.S. Despite his long record of appropriate handling of classified\ninformation, and the good relationship between the U.S. and Lithuania, I am unable to\n\n18\nconclude at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant access to classified information due to unmitigated foreign influence concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

ROSS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nThe Applicant has had seven alcohol-related arrests and convictions between 1978 and 2005,\nand is currently on probation for his last conviction.    He was also convicted for an offense involving\na physical altercation with his wife in 2002.  He has attended several alcohol education and alcohol\ntreatment programs, and has abstained from alcohol use for six months as of the time the record\nclosed.  However, the evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the case against him.  He is not currently\neligible for a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 6, 2006, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on February 5, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing\nwas issued on February 16, 2007.\nA hearing was held on March 15, 2007, at which the Government presented ten documentary\nexhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted five hearing exhibits and two\npost-hearing exhibits.  The transcript was received on April 5, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 51, married (but separated) and has a high school diploma.  He is employed\nby a defense contractor as a mechanic, and he seeks to retain a Secret-level DoD security clearance\npreviously granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based\nupon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are\nentered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer\nto the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol abuse).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants to excess.\nThe Applicant admitted subparagraphs 1.b. through 1.m. under this Paragraph.  Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\n\nTranscript at 62-63, 66, 69.

The Applicant began\ndrinking around the time he entered the Army, in 1973.  The Applicant testified that he often drank\nto excess because he was involved in two bad marriages.   According to the Applicant, he stopped\n1\ndrinking for about nine years after his March 1994 arrest (further discussed below).   He resumed\n2\ndrinking in about 2001, because of marital problems he was undergoing.  He stopped drinking\nbetween January and June 2006.   He further testified that he last drank alcohol on September 9,\n3\n2006.4\nBeginning in 1978, the Applicant was arrested eight times for Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol.  Seven of the arrests resulted in convictions: they were in October 1978 (1.b.),5\nDecember 1986 (1.c.),  January 1994 (1.d.),  March 1994 (1.f.),  September 2004 (1.j.),  October\n6\n7\n8\n9\n2005 (1.k.),  and November 2005 (1.l.).\n10\n11\nThe sentences the Applicant received for these convictions included various fines, jail time\nof various lengths, and terms of probation.  He was also required to attend First Offender Alcohol\nEducation programs several times.  The Applicant is currently on five years probation for his last\narrest, in November 2005.  He was also sentenced to attend an 18 month alcohol program, which will\nbe completed in November 2007.          \n12\nThe Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence in September 2002 (1.I).  The\nDistrict Attorney rejected the matter and no criminal charges were filed against the Applicant.   This\n13\nsubparagraph is found for the Applicant.\n\nTranscript at 82, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 2.\n14\nTranscript at 68.\n15\nTranscript at 100-104, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 2, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G at 2-3.\n16\nTranscript at 89-91; Government Exhibits 4, 6 and 7.\n17\nTranscript at 92-93, 98; Applicant\u2019s Answer at 2.\n18\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A.\n19\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 4, 6; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G at 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.\n20\n4\nThe Applicant attended alcohol treatment from 1994 through 1996 (1.e.).  He attended a\ndifferent program after his last conviction, successfully completing the outpatient program in\nFebruary 2007 (1.m.).   He was also hospitalized in 2002 for alcohol abuse (1.h.).  The Applicant\n14\nhas attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) on a fairly regular basis since 1994.  He testified, \u201cI went\nto the meetings partially because I had to, and because I wanted to try and understand what is was\nabout, going to AA.\u201d   When he can, the Applicant continues to attend two to three AA meetings\n15\na week.  \n16\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\n2.a.  The information set forth above concerning allegations 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k.,\nand 1.l., will be considered under this Paragraph as well.\n2.b.  The Applicant admitted that he got into a verbal argument with his spouse in June 2002.\nThe story is somewhat confusing, but it appears that the Applicant and his wife go into a fight and\nhe grabbed a telephone out of her hand.  She alleged at the time that he scratched her when he took\nthe phone away from her.  The Applicant denies intentionally hurting his wife, but he was arrested\nanyway and charged with Inflicting Corporal Injury on Spouse and Preventing/Dissuading Witness\nto Report.  He plead nolo contendere to an amended count of Challenge to Fight in Public.  He was\nfined, given two years probation and sentenced to attend a 52 week anger management course.  The\nApplicant has successfully completed the course.17\n2.c.  The Applicant admitted that he accidentally missed a court date in April 2006.  When\nhe next returned to court in October 2006, he was asked about why he missed the prior date and he\nexplained the circumstances.  The bench warrant was subsequently removed.18\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant is described by his co-workers as a hard-working, responsible and dedicated\nemployee.   He has received recognition from his employer with regards to his work.   The\n19\n20\n\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18.\n21\n5\nApplicant also has received Honorable Discharges from the Army and his State\u2019s National Guard,\nas well as other recognition.21\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n6\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in alcohol related incidents or other criminal acts that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has a long history of alcohol-related criminal incidents (Guidelines G and J); and that\nhe had other criminal incidents as well (Guideline J).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him, except\nin part.  Under Paragraph 1 (Guideline G), as set forth above, subparagraph 1.i. is found for the\nApplicant.  Subparagraph 2.c. under Paragraph 2 (Guideline J) is also found for the Applicant\nbecause he missed the court date do to an inadvertent error and not through an intentional act.\nThe Applicant has an almost 30 year history of alcohol related arrests and convictions.  Four\nof these convictions occurred before 1994, and under other circumstances could be mitigated.\nHowever, the fact remains that his last three convictions occurred in September 2004, October 2005\nand November 2005.  He last drank alcohol in September 2006, meaning he only had about six\n\n7\nmonths of sobriety at the time the record closed in this case.  Given the fact that he has previously\nhad extended periods of sobriety followed by continuing alcohol abuse, it is simply too soon to say\nthat his abuse of alcohol is behind him.  \nThe following Disqualifying Conditions under Guideline G are applicable to this case: 22(a)\nAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and 22(c) Habitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  None of the Mitigating Conditions are\napplicable.  The evidence shows that the Applicant\u2019s conduct was not infrequent, that it did not occur\nunder unusual circumstances and it does cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and\ngood judgement.  I have considered the fact that the Applicant has attended and successfully\ncompleted several alcohol education and/or treatment programs.  However, he has returned to\nalcohol abuse after attending prior treatments, and as of the time of the hearing it had only been one\nmonth since he had completed his last treatment.  Paragraph 1 is found against the Applicant.\nTurning to Guideline J, Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant.  His seven arrests and\nconvictions for alcohol-related offenses, plus his arrest and conviction for a case involving a physical\ndispute with his wife, puts him squarely within Disqualifying Conditions 31.(a) A single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses and 31(c) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless\nof whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  In addition, the\nApplicant remains on probation for his last conviction, bringing his case within Disqualifying\nCondition 31.(d) Individual is currently on parole or probation.  None of the Mitigating Conditions\napply to this paragraph.  Not enough time has passed to show that the conduct will not occur again,\nI am not convinced that he was pressured into the acts, nor is there sufficient evidence of\nrehabilitation at this point in time.\nThe Applicant's efforts at reform are noted, and he is commended for his decision to refrain\nfrom further alcohol use.  If he continues to maintain his sobriety he may be eligible for a clearance\nin the future.  He is not eligible now.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, this evidence\ndoes not overcome the adverse information that has been presented by the Government.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's\ninformation opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a\nfinding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of\nthe Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

On appeal he contends that the Judge mis-\nweighed the evidence\u2014arguing that his disqualifying conduct amounted to isolated and aberrational\ninstances when viewed in the context of his progressive life achievements.  In support of that\ncontention, Applicant argues that he is a law-abiding, hard-working individual of uprightness,\nmorals, dignity and a model citizen.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on the part of\nthe Judge.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence contained in the FORM\nagainst the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant under Guideline H.\nHowever, he reasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating evidence to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s other security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by the Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination under Guidelines C and B is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that he had not mitigated the\ntrustworthiness concerns raised under Guidelines C and B.  In support of this argument, Applicant\nsummarizes the favorable evidence he presented below.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s\nargument persuasive.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the trustworthiness concerns raised by his possession of a Yemeni passport, and his family ties\nand property interests in Yemen, had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees\nwith the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the\nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nnature and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s trustworthiness\nconcerns.

On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations made under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n  Government Exhibit (GE) 3 (Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR).\n2\n  The motion was included in the FORM. The text of the new allegations is as follow: \u201cSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b You were\n3\narrested on or about August 22, 1993, in Warwick, Rhode Island, and charged with Domestic Assault and Domestic\nDisorderly Conduct.

In 2003, he deliberately failed to disclose in his security clearance\napplication his convictions and the full extent of his alcohol related treatment. Applicant failed to\npresent sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, alcohol\nconsumption, and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 10, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR\ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators\ncould not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant him access to classified information.  On November 11, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR\n1\n(Answer),  and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a hearing. \n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which was mailed to\nApplicant on March 13, 2007. He acknowledged receipt of the FORM on March 21, 2007, did not\nobject to anything contained in the FORM, and submitted additional information for consideration\nwithin the 30-day time period provided to him. The case was assigned to me on April 30, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nThe government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2, by adding \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, and 2.c.  Applicant did not\n3\nobject to the motion and failed to answer the new allegations. I granted the government\u2019s motion\nwithout objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n  GE 4 (Office of Personnel Management Security Clearance Application (SF86), dated May 1, 2003), unless\n4\nindicated otherwise, is the source for the facts in this paragraph.\n  GE 4, question 31.\n5\n  GE 8.\n6\n  GE 9.\n7\n  GE 11.\n8\n  GE 5.\n9\n3\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations with explanations, except for amended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b,\nand 2.c, which he failed to answer. I considered \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.f (all Guideline E allegations), denied,\nbecause he denied providing false information with the deliberate intent to mislead the government.\nI also considered the additional allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, and 2.c, denied. His admissions and explanations\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, and the FORM\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 49-year-old senior structural designer.  He has worked for a defense contractor\n4\nsince 1979. He has had access to classified information at the secret level since March 1989.5\nApplicant married his first wife in August 1980, and they were divorced in February 1998. He has\nthree children for whom he provides support. He disclosed no education beyond junior high school.\nAll the SOR allegations are based on the following facts and behavior:\nIn November 1983, Applicant was charged with second degree sexual assault, a felony.  He\n6\npled nolo contendere to assault with intent to commit sexual assault, a felony. He was found guilty\nand sentenced to serve one year at a correctional institution (suspended), to pay court costs, and\nplaced on two-years probation.\nIn August 1993, Applicant had been drinking and was involved in an altercation with his\nwife. He was charged with domestic assault and domestic disorderly conduct. He pled nolo\ncontendere to both charges.  \n7\nIn December 1996, Applicant had been drinking and was involved in an altercation with his\nwife. He pled nolo contendere to the charge of domestic assault and battery. The court found him\nguilty and sentenced him, among other things, to undergo domestic violence counseling, to continue\nhis alcohol counseling, and placed him on one-year probation.  His then wife tried to stop him from\n8\ndrinking and he refused to do so. After he assaulted his wife in 1996, she filed for divorce.\nIn 1997, he drove his car after consuming alcoholic beverages. He was charged with driving\nwhile intoxicated (DWI) after failing a Breathalyzer Test. As part of a prosecution deferment\nprogram for first time alcohol offenders, the court allowed Applicant to enter into a pretrial alcohol\neducation program. He signed in the first day of the program and never returned.  He failed to\n9\ncomplete the alcohol treatment program.\n\n  GE 6 (Applicant\u2019s March 2004 statement), and GE 13.\n10\n  GE 19, (Hospital records, with an admission date of 5/24/00 - 5/31/00. The records indicate Applicant has\n11\na long and extensive history of alcohol dependence since age 12, consuming up to a case of beer on a day, and\nundergoing detoxification treatment in 1986).\n  GE 15 and 16.\n12\n  GE 17.\n13\n  GE 18.\n14\n4\nIn January 2000, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages and was involved in an altercation\nwith his new live-in girlfriend.  He pled nolo contendere to domestic assault. The court found him\n10\nguilty and sentenced him, among other things, to serve one year at a correctional institution\n(suspended), and placed him on one-year probation with the condition that he undergo domestic\nviolence counseling and substance abuse counseling. \nFrom May 22, 2000 to May 31, 2000, Applicant underwent inpatient treatment for alcohol\ndetoxification and was admitted into a hospital alcohol and drug program. He was diagnosed with\n\u201calcohol dependence, acute, and current.\u201d  He then received alcohol treatment from approximately\n11\nJune 7, 2000, to January 8, 2001. During that period of time, he tested positive for alcohol in July\n2000, and was involved in the two alcohol related offenses listed in the next two paragraphs. After\nundergoing intensive alcohol treatment from July 25, 2000 to August 7, 2000, Applicant continued\nto consume alcoholic beverages. From October 2000 to February 2001, Applicant underwent\ntreatment with a physician who diagnosed him with alcohol dependence. Applicant failed to\ncomplete his alcohol treatment program. From April to June 2001, Applicant received outpatient and\nimpatient residential alcohol treatment for his alcohol dependence.\nIn July 2000, Applicant drove his car after consuming alcoholic beverages. He was stopped\nby police officers and charged with refusing to submit to a chemical test, operating an unregister\nvehicle, and a lane roadway violation. He was convicted of refusing to submit to a chemical test.12\nThe court sentence him to pay a fine, to pay court costs, to complete a DWI program, to perform\ncommunity service, his driver\u2019s license was suspended, and placed him on probation.\nIn January 2001, while serving probation, Applicant drove his car after consuming alcoholic\nbeverages. He was involved in a car accident and left the scene of the accident. He was charged with\nprobation violation and leaving the scene of an accident. His probation was revoked.  He was found\n13\nguilty of leaving the scene of an accident and sentenced to serve six months at a correctional\ninstitution.  The sentence was suspended on the condition that he undergo residential alcohol\n14\ntreatment, serve two months home confinement, and comply with the terms of his one-year\nprobation.\nIn his May 2003 security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 21,\nwhich asked whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense. Applicant\nfailed to disclose that in 1983 he was charged with second degree sexual assault, a felony offense,\nand that he was found guilty of a felony offense, i.e., assault with intent to commit sexual assault.\n(SOR \u00b61.a.1). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his failure to disclose the information\n\n  GE 19.\n15\n  GE 5.\n16\n5\nwas not deliberate. He claimed that in 2003, he told a background investigator that he did not\ndisclose the information because he believed the felony charge had been reduced to a misdemeanor.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24, which asked whether he had ever been charged\nwith or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. Applicant failed to disclose his 1997\nDWI charge/conviction; his July 2000 charge and conviction for failure to submit to a chemical test;\nand his January 2001 charges/conviction for probation violation (consuming alcoholic beverages)\nand leaving the scene of an accident. \nApplicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 26, which asked whether in the last seven years\nhe had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed elsewhere in the SF\n86. Applicant failed to disclose he was arrested, charged, and found guilty of three different offenses,\ni.e., domestic assault both in December 1996 and January 2000, and for leaving the scene of an\naccident in January 2001. Applicant claimed his failure to disclose the information was not deliberate\nbecause he did not know what to answer at the time he completed the security clearance application.\nApplicant also answered \u201cYes\u201d to question 30, which asked whether in the last seven years\nhis use of alcoholic beverages resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling. Applicant\ndisclosed he received treatment from April 2000 to July 2000 at one institution. He failed to disclose,\nhowever, inpatient treatment for alcohol detoxification at other hospital from May 22 to May 31,\n2000; that he received additional alcohol treatment at two other institutions by qualified medical\nprofessionals from approximately June 2000 to January 2001; and that he underwent outpatient and\nimpatient residential alcohol treatment from April 2001 to June 2001. Applicant also failed to\ndisclose alcohol detoxification treatment he received in 1986.15\nIn August 2003, Applicant was interviewed and provided a written, sworn statement to a\ngovernment background investigator.  During the interview, he was asked to disclose any adverse\n16\ncontacts with law enforcement officials. He disclosed his 1996 charge/conviction for domestic\nassault, his 1997 DWI, and his 2001 conviction for leaving the scene of an accident. He failed to\ndisclose, however, his 1983 felony charge/conviction for assault with intent to commit a sexual\nassault, his 2000 charge/conviction for refusal to submit to a chemical test, and his 2000\ncharge/conviction for domestic assault. Applicant claimed his omissions were not deliberate, because\nhe believed his 1983 felony charge had been reduced to a misdemeanor. He did not explain why he\nfailed to disclose the other two convictions. During the interview, he claimed he has not consumed\nalcoholic beverages since June 2001 to the day of the interview. He explained that when he used to\ndrink, he did not drink regularly or on a daily basis, but from time to time he would go on weekend\ndrinking binges.\nIn his February 2005 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that the last day\nhe consumed alcoholic beverages was in August 2000. Applicant\u2019s last consumption of alcohol was\nat least on January 5, 2001, when he consumed alcoholic beverages, was involved in a car accident,\nand left the scene of the accident. He explained he made an honest mistake and reported the wrong\ndate (the date he was released from treatment), and that he did not intend to mislead the government.\n\n  Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination\n17\nbased upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy\nin enclosure 2 . . .\u201d\n  Directive, \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . .

Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial evidence\nis such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the record.); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n6\nApplicant expressed remorse numerous times, stating that he was sorry for his past behavior,\nand for providing the wrong information in his security clearance application. He claimed he has not\nbeen in trouble during the last six years, and asked that his past mistakes not be considered against\nhim. He averred he is reliable, truthful, a hard-worker, and a good person. There is no evidence he\nhas mishandled or caused the compromise of classified information while employed by a defense\ncontractor. Applicant highlighted that he has been working for his current employer for the last 28\nyears, and that he needed his job to support his children.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the Disqualifying and\nMitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence\nor absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the whole person concept.\n17\n18\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the applicable relevant\nadjudicative guidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the\n19\nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.20\n\n  Egan, supra n.10, at 528, 531.\n21\n  See Id; Directive Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).\n22\n  Guidelines \u00b6 30. Hereinafter, the particular paragraph of the Guidelines will be cited as part of the relevant\n23\ndisqualifying and mitigating condition. See n.1 supra.\n  It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\n24\nstatement or representation, or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive\nbranch of the Government of the United States. Egan, 484 U.S. at 527 (discussing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001). \n  ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 ( App. Bd. May 19, 2006).\n25\n7\nThe responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the burden of persuasion.21\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest\nto ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who\nwill protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.22\nCONCLUSIONS\nSince this case is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to the\ncontents of the various documents in the case file.\nUnder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  The government established its case\n23\nunder Guideline J by showing that Applicant was convicted for seven offenses between 1983 and\n2001, including a conviction for a felony offense. I also find, as discussed below under Guideline\nE, that Applicant deliberately falsified his 2003 security clearance application. His falsification of\nthe SF 86 is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, a felony.  Disqualifying Condition (DC) 31(a): a single\n24\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses and DC 31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, apply.\nApplicant\u2019s past behavior, from 1983 to 2003, forms a pattern of criminal activity. His\nfalsification brings to the forefront the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption concerns raised\nby his past behavior. I am required to consider Applicant\u2019s overall questionable behavior when\nevaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the SOR to determine factors such as the extent\nto which his behavior is recent; the likelihood of recurrence; Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning\nthe circumstances of the incidents alleged; and his rehabilitation.25\nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is recent and not\nisolated. Applicant engaged in criminal misconduct over a period of at least 20 years, from the time\n\n  I specifically considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (MC) 32(a): so much time has elapsed since\n26\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 32(d): there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\n  Guidelines \u00b6 21.\n27\n  In his answer to the FORM, Applicant stated \u201clast year I went back to \u201cKH\u201d (institution) for a revelation to\n28\nget my drivers license back.\u201d It is not clear from Applicant\u2019s evidence whether he has been sober since 2001 or if he had\na relapse. \n8\nhe was 25 until he was 45. The available evidence indicates he has not been involved in criminal\nmisconduct since 2003. However, considering his 20-year history of criminal behavior, the nature\nand seriousness of his misconduct, his falsification of the SF 86, and his prolonged, disregard for the\nlaw, I find his favorable information (i.e., good employee records, change in lifestyle, and remorse)\nis not sufficient to mitigate the Guideline J security concerns. His behavior raises questions about\nhis ability and willingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified information. His\nfalsification weighs against a finding of rehabilitation and positive behavioral changes. I find that\nnone of the mitigating conditions apply.  Guideline J is decided against Applicant.\n26\nUnder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), excessive alcohol consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  The government established its case under\n27\nGuideline G by showing that from 1983 to 2001, he was charged/convicted for six alcohol-related\nincidents, including a DWI conviction. Applicant abused alcohol, and that resulted in his exercising\nquestionable judgment. Guideline G Disqualifying Condition (DC) 22(a): alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence . . . applies. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been involved in any alcohol-related misconduct\nsince January 2001. As such, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) 23(a): so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, may apply. \nNotwithstanding, the record establishes Applicant was diagnosed with acute alcohol\ndependence several times, and underwent repeated alcohol rehabilitation treatment numerous times.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s lengthy abuse of alcohol, the number of alcohol-related incidents, and the\nseriousness of his alcohol-related misconduct, he has failed to provide sufficient information as to\nhis current level of alcohol use to show he is now a responsible user.  Nor does the available\n28\nevidence establish a favorable diagnosis or prognosis for the Applicant, or that he has no alcohol\nrelated problems. In light of the extent of Applicant\u2019s alcohol related behavior, the passage of time\nsince 2001, alone, is not sufficient to show that his past behavior is not likely to recur, or to show\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Under the totality of the circumstances, I conclude\nthat Applicant\u2019s favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the alcohol consumption security\nconcerns. I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n\n  Guidelines \u00b6 15.\n29\n9\nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.29\nApplicant admitted he failed to disclose relevant information in his answers to SF 86\nquestions 21, 24, and 26. He further admitted providing false information to a defense investigator\nin 2003. In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, age, length of employment, the number of incidents that\nhe failed to disclose, the seriousness of those incidents, the circumstances surrounding those\nincidents, and the fact he has had access to classified information since 1989, I find Applicant\u2019s\nomissions were deliberate and made with the intent to mislead the government. Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire . . ., DC 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and DC 16(e): personal conduct or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress . . ., apply.\nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.f, I find for Applicant. He disclosed his 2001 alcohol-related incident\nin his 2003 statement to a defense investigator. Thus, I considered Applicant\u2019s failure to provide the\ncorrect date he last consumed alcohol an oversight.\nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and conclude that none\napply. Although the falsification occurred in 2003, considering the totality of the circumstances in\nApplicant\u2019s case, the passage of time alone is not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised\nby his behavior. Furthermore, he presented no evidence that he has reduced his vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. Additionally, for the same reasons outlined above under the\ndiscussions of Guidelines J and G incorporated herein, I conclude none of the MCs apply. Guideline\nE is decided against Applicant.\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I specifically considered\nApplicant\u2019s age, the lack of any misconduct or questionable behavior since 2003, his 28 years\nworking for a defense contractor, and his positive changes in behavior since 2003. As previously\ndiscussed, Applicant\u2019s overall past behavior forms a pattern of disturbing criminal activity and\nalcohol abuse with significant adverse security implications. His falsifications bring to the forefront\nthe criminal conduct, drug use, and alcohol abuse concerns raised by his past behavior. His failure\nto provide truthful answers in his security clearance application shows he cannot be trusted, and\nshow a serious lack of judgment. Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to mitigate the\noverall judgment and trustworthiness security concerns raised by his behavior, and the likelihood of\nrecurrence remains a concern.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are\nas follows:\nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct (Guideline E)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct (Guideline J)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Alcohol Consumption (Guideline G)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

She owes 12 delinquent debts totaling about $29,000, used marijuana from 1995 to 2004,\nand was discharged from four jobs between 1998 and 2002.  She mitigated the drug involvement,\nand personal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  She did not mitigate the financial considerations\ntrustworthiness concern.  Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On August 1, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing, but did not date her Answer.  She elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on\nOctober 16, 2006.  That administrative judge set a hearing for November 28, 2006, but granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for continuance because of Applicant counsel\u2019s illness.  The case was reassigned\nto me on December 6, 2006.  On January 31, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for\nApplicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.\nThe Government moved to amend the SOR to delete a reference to paragraph 3-614, DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R in the precatory language of the SOR because it was not applicable to this\nproceeding.  The Applicant having no objection, I granted the motion (Tr. 6).  DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 29 years old, married but separated from her husband whom she married in\nDecember 1999, and lives with her current boyfriend.  When she married, her husband started\nabusing her, and caused a separation between Applicant and her family.  Applicant had several\nmiscarriages and her husband forced her to have an abortion during her marriage.  Applicant worked\ntwo or three jobs while her husband spent her income and did not work.  Applicant had no debt when\nshe married.  She finally left him in 2000, and moved to her current city of residence.  She wants a\ndivorce, but has to save the money to pay for the divorce.  Her current boyfriend does not work due\nto foot and anxiety problems, but is seeking employment.  Applicant pays all expenses presently.\nApplicant miscarried her latest pregnancy in January 2007, resulting in a hospital stay. (Tr. 15-20,\n35, 59-61, 66, 75; Exhibit 1) \nAfter Applicant  moved to her current location, she had a series of temporary jobs until\nobtaining a permanent position in October 2002.  She remained in that job until February 2004, when\nshe obtained her current position as a customer service representative with the defense contractor.\nHer current income from that position is $1,520 monthly. (Tr. 22-26, 49, 57; Exhibit H)\n\n4\nApplicant used marijuana from 1995 until late 2003 or early 2004.  She did not use it after\nFebruary 2004 when she completed the Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, the standard form\n85P (85P).  She obtained marijuana from friends to relieve the stress of her financial, physical, and\nmarital problems.  She does not intend to use it again.  She now exercises, reads, bicycles, meditates,\nand uses other techniques to relieve her life stresses.  She consulted with a licensed clinical social\nworker in June 2005, attempting to resolve her diagnosed adjustment disorder with mixed emotional\nfeatures. (Tr. 20, 21, 27-30, 32, 62; Exhibit G)\nBetween December 1998 and March 2002, Applicant lost four jobs because of various\nallegations of wrongdoing.  Her toy store employer discharged her in December 1998 based on\nallegations of theft.  Next, a drug store employer terminated her on March 2, 1999, for stealing three\ncustomer\u2019s credit card numbers and using them to purchase merchandise for herself.  In a signed\nstatement to that company\u2019s investigator, Applicant admitted stealing other merchandise from her\nemployer.  The total value of all items taken illegally by Applicant she estimated at $332.88.  Then,\na leasing company for whom Applicant worked terminated her in December 2000, for using all her\nsick time.  Applicant wanted to stop working for that company, and told her supervisor that desire.\nThe company then terminated her.  Lastly, Applicant lost her job at a mail order company in March\n2002 based on harassment allegations.  Applicant claims she was harassed by another employee, but\nthe employer terminated her, as Applicant understands the reason to be because she harassed the\nother employee.  Applicant never received a written termination letter from the employer detailing\nthe reasons for this job termination. (Tr. 43-47; Exhibits 1, 3-5)\nApplicant owes 12 delinquent debts totaling about $29,000.  She paid one delinquent debt\nthrough a garnishment process after the creditor obtained a judgment, paying a total amount of\n$857.46 by May 2006 (SOR subparagraph 1.b., $615 to a financial institution).  Applicant does not\nhave the income to repay the other delinquent debts at the present time because her monthly\nexpenses total $1,611 and her income is $1,520 monthly.  She has no credit cards, and does not have\ncable television service because she cannot afford it.  She attended a financial counseling course in\n2002, and is allowed to use the course advisors as needed in the future.  She is working on a budget\nfor 2007.  She moved from an apartment in mid-2006 where she paid $905 for rent into an apartment\ncosting $695 monthly.  She does not have a car and takes the bus to work, consuming about an\nhour\u2019s travel time each way.  Her boyfriend did not work in 2006 and is looking for a job in 2007,\nand until he can contribute to the household income she pays all expenses.  Those expenses included\nabout $3,000 in medical expenses over what her health insurance paid in 2006. (Tr. 30-40, 57, 65,\n67; Exhibits 2, C-F)\nThe unpaid delinquent debts owed by Applicant are the following debts as listed in the SOR.\nApplicant owes $10,574 to a lender subparagraph 1.a.) for the balance due on a used car she\npurchased, but which was repossessed in 2001 when she could no longer make payments after she\nseparated from her husband.  Applicant claims the delinquent debt for $13,782 in a judgment from\n2002 (subparagraph 1.c.) is the same debt owed for the car in subparagraph 1.a.  The delinquent debt\nfor $123 owed to a retailer in subparagraph 1.d. is unpaid.  It occurred because her husband took\nmoney from the checking account without telling Applicant, and she later wrote a check that was\nreturned for insufficient funds.  The $74 account owed in subparagraph 1.e. is the same situation as\nthe previous debt to the same retailer.  The $549 debt in subparagraph 1.f. is owed to a \u201cpay day\u201d\nloan company.  The $456 debt owed in subparagraph 1.g. is for a telephone bill.  The bank debt for\n$675 in subparagraph 1.h. is an overdrawn account resulting from her husband\u2019s withdrawal of funds\n\n5\nfrom the account.  The $1,135 owed to a credit card company in subparagraph 1.i. is for purchases\nshe made before that card was stolen.  A telephone bill for $1,205 is the debt in subparagraph 1.j.\nApplicant does not recognize the $133 debt in subparagraph 1.k..  The $253 debt listed in\nsubparagraph 1.l is for a cable television bill Applicant incurred and could not pay when she lived\nwith her husband.  Applicant is not certain of the basis for the $128 debt owed in subparagraph 1.m.\nNone of these creditors have contacted Applicant, nor has she contacted them about payment\narrangements lately.  She contacted some in 2005 when her boyfriend worked and she had some\nmoney to repay some portion of the debts.  She is currently working with two credit counselors to\nattempt to consolidate her debt and establish a monthly repayment schedule.  Applicant also attends\na \u201cget checking\u201d educational program at a local credit union, the completion of which will enable\nApplicant to open checking and savings accounts at the credit union.

It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\n\n6\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. E2.A6.1.1\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement: The Concern. Improper or illegal involvement with drugs,\nraises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.\nDrug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information. E2.A8.1.1\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nE2.A5.1.1\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations  Applicant has 12 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Two may\nbe duplicates of each other, but nonetheless she has significant debts totaling  $19,000 to $29,000\n(the lesser amount would be the debt if the duplication is eliminated).  She has made no effort to\nrepay these debts.  The one listed debt repaid was by garnishment of her wages.  Applicant\u2019s income\nis consumed monthly by her expenses.  She supports her unemployed boyfriend, causing her deficit\nspending.  Having a roommate who split the rent costs would allow Applicant to apply about $300\nmonthly to debt reduction.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (A history of not meeting financial\nobligations E2.A6.1.2.1), and DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts E2.A6.1.2.3) apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are caused in part by her marital situation, but she has had\nseven years during which she could have addressed her delinquent debts, and has not done anything\nto resolve them.  Her unemployed boyfriend is currently a financial drain on her.  Mitigating\nConditions (MC) 3 (the conditions resulting in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol, such as loss of employment, unexpected medical emergency, and divorce or separation\nE2.A6.1.3.3) does not apply because of the time interval of separation, and the repeated poor\njudgment she exercised over the past seven years in not attempting to resolve even her smaller debts.\nNone of the other MC apply.\nDrug Involvement Applicant used marijuana from 1995 at the age of 17 until February 2004\nat the age of 26.  She used it to relieve the stress of her life, including the abuse from her husband.\nDC 1 (any drug abuse. E2.A8.1.2.1) applies.\nThe last drug use of Applicant was February 2004.  She expressed an intent not to use it again\nin the future, choosing meditation and exercise, among other techniques, to relieve her stresses.  I\nconclude she is credible in her explanation of her future plans.  MC 1 (the drug involvement is not\nrecent. E2.A8.1.3.1) and MC 3 (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\nE2.A8.1.3.3) apply.\nPersonal Conduct  Four employers between 1998 and 2002 terminated Applicant for various\nreasons, including two for theft, one for being harassed by another employee or harassing another\nemployee, and one for excessive use of sick leave.  DC 1 (reliable, unfavorable information provided\nby associates, employers, or coworkers. E2.A5.1.2.1), DC 4 (personal conduct that increases an\nindividual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which,\nif known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person\nsusceptible to blackmail. E2.A5.1.2.4), and DC 5 (a pattern of dishonesty. E2.A5.1.2.5) apply.\nApplicant has worked faithfully for two employers for the past five years.  She has no\ndifficulties in these two jobs, and she has been working for her present employer for three years.  She\nhas taken positive steps to reduce her vulnerability to duress and coercion.  She has had no further\nemployment problems since 2002.  MC 5 (the individual has taken positive steps to significantly\nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. E2.A5.1.3.5) applies.  \nWhole Person Analysis\n\n8\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\" trustworthiness decision. Directive\nE2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision.  The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is known as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative\njudge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the whole person concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s age, her demeanor while testifying and candid discussion about her finances and abusive\nmarital relationship.  Regarding her financial situation and the delinquent debts, Applicant expressed\na willingness to resolve her financial obligations, but has she has done nothing to resolve her debts.\nNor has she done anything since the SOR was sent to her to resolve even some of the debts to\nestablish a pattern and commitment to paying her delinquent debts.  She saved no money over seven\nyears since her separation.  Even during the past five years while holding full-time positions, she\nignored the debts and did not develop a plan to repay them.  She incurred additional financial\nburdens by living with an unemployed boyfriend whom she supports.  \nEvaluating her marijuana usage I conclude it is not recent and she will not use it again in the\nfuture to escape from her problems and stresses.  Her marijuana use stopped three years ago and she\nconvincingly stated her commitment not to use it again in the future.  Even time has passed that her\nmarijuana usage is not recent.  \nConsidering her employment history, her later two discharges were for interpersonal and\npersonal reasons, not work performance or misconduct issues.  She has now established a consistent\nand apparently untroubled work history for the past five years which mitigates that concern.  She\nexplained which situations and their context persuasively in contrast to her present employment and\ninterpersonal relationships to show that type of conduct will not recur in the future.  Hence, all\nallegations under Paragraph 1 of the SOR are concluded against her.  The allegations under\nParagraphs 2 and 3 of SOR are decided for her.  The whole person concept analysis is concluded\nagainst her on the basis of the financial considerations trustworthiness concern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph   1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c. to 1.m.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. to 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a. to 3.d.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHer application for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 4, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\n\nDepartment Counsel does not appeal the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions as to Guideline C.\n1\n2\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On June\n30, 2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s whole person\nanalysis is unsupported by record evidence and is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.1\nApplicant submitted a response which primarily restates the information he submitted in response\nto the SOR.  To the extent that the reply brief contains information not contained in the record\nbelow, however, that information is new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6\n3.1.29.  We reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant the security clearance.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\nIn 1984, Applicant moved to the United States.  Applicant married an American citizen in\n1987.  They divorced in 1991.  Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in 1993.  To assist\nin the settlement of his father\u2019s estate, Applicant applied for an Iranian passport and paid a fee to the\nIranian government for it in lieu of military service.  Applicant never used the passport for travel,\nand it expired in 2006.  Applicant has no property in or attachments to Iran.\nWhen Applicant\u2019s father died intestate, ownership of the family home passed to Applicant\u2019s\nmother and all the children.  When Applicant\u2019s mother decided to sell the home and move to the\nU.S., Applicant and his seven siblings had to provide quitclaim deeds before the house could be sold.\nApplicant had to have an Iranian passport for his quitclaim deed to be acceptable to the Iranian\ngovernment.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother and most of his siblings are now registered aliens in the U.S.  One sibling\nlives in Australia.  One sister and an uncle remain citizens and residents of Iran.  They belong to a\nminority religion in Iran and are subject to systemic persecution.  The uncle is blind and in his\neighties, and moving to another country would be very difficult for him.  Applicant has not seen\nthese two relatives in eighteen years, but speaks to them regularly.  Applicant acknowledges he is\nbound to his sister by ties of affection and, to a lesser extent, to his uncle         \nIran has been hostile to the U.S. since the Islamic Revolution began in 1979.  Iran supports\nterrorist groups and is making efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction.  Iran has a poor record\nof human rights, and there is evidence of summary executions, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture\nand other degrading treatment of prisoners, and violence against women.  There is no indication that\nIran has ever attempted to exploit any resident of Iran for the purpose of compromising a security\nclearance holder in the U.S.\n\n\u201cAn immediate family member...is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 \n2\nD2.A2.1.2.1.  \n\u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s)...in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a\n3\nposition to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the\nperson(s) involved and the United States.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6  E2.A2.1.3.1.\n3\nOn August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,\nCommunications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I) issued guidance clarifying the application of the\nForeign Preference adjudicative guidline.  The ASDC3I memo states any clearance must be denied\nor revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains approval for its use from\nthe appropriate agency of the U.S. government.  A copy of the ASDC3I\u2019s memo was sent to\nApplicant as part of the FORM.  The record contains no evidence of surrender of the Iranian passport\nby Applicant.\nB.  Discussion\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s appeal involves the Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusions.  \nWhether Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions \nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)). \u201c[N]o one has a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a\nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse the\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. and \u00b6 E3.1.33.3. \nGiven his findings, the Judge properly concluded that Foreign Influence Disqualifying\nCondition (FIDC) 1  is applicable to this case.  That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to\n2\nApplicant.  \u201cIf there are admitted or proven facts or circumstances that raise security concerns,\u2018[t]he\napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate\nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u2019\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-28838 at\n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 12, 2006); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \nThe Administrative  Judge found that Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 1  was\n3\nproperly raised by the facts.  In evaluating FIMC 1, the Judge observed that \u201c[t]he hostility of Iran\nto the United States places a heavy burden on Applicant to demonstrate that the immediate family\nmembers in Iran do not pose a security risk and that he is not in a position to be forced to choose\nbetween loyalty to the United States and his family members.  With its adversarial stance and its\ndismal human rights record, it is conceivable that Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to\ngather information from the United States.\u201d  Decision at 6.   The Judge concluded that the evidence\n\n4\nsupplied by Applicant was insufficient to meet his burden of persuasion as to the second clause of\nFIMC 1.  Having properly declined to apply the mitigating condition, therefore, the Judge based his\nfavorable decision upon his whole person analysis.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 14, 2006). \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis does not sufficiently\naddress the nature of the Iranian regime and the vulnerability of Applicant\u2019s Iranian relatives to\ncoercion by that regime, relying upon Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8 (\u201cpotential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\u201d) for the proposition that it is the only adjudicative factor fully relevant to\nGuideline B cases.  Although a sufficient whole person analysis should take into account a variety\nof matters in addition to the this adjudicative factor (see ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd.\nJan. 5, 2007)), we nevertheless find merit in Department Counsel\u2019s argument, considered as a whole.\nThat is, while the Judge properly noted such favorable facts as the 22 years which Applicant has\nlived in the U.S., his U.S. citizenship, and his sincere statement that he would not act contrary to this\ncountry despite whatever pressures Iran exerted on his relatives, the Judge does not explain why\nthese factors outweigh security concerns raised by the presence of his sister and uncle in Iran.  Of\ncourse, as stated above, Applicant has provided his own assurance that he would not act contrary to\nthe interests of the U.S.  However, the Board has previously held that such statements are of limited\nweight, given their hypothetical nature.  See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 21,\n2005); ISCR Case No. 0-02892 at 4 (App. Bd. June 28, 2004).  In light of this, we conclude that the\nJudge abused his discretion in concluding that Applicant had satisfied his burden of persuasion.   \nFinally, the Judge concludes by saying \u201cApplicant is a mature individual with a history of\nservice to this country.  Because of Applicant\u2019s long standing. . . loyalties in the U.S. he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.\u201d  Decision at 7.  The\nJudge\u2019s reference to loyalties in the U.S. is problematic given the clear language of the Executive\nOrder that these proceedings \u201cshall in no sense be a loyalty determination.\u201d  Given the sparse record\nin this case it is difficult to justify the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has a history of service to\nthis country. \nThe Board notes that as of the close of the record in this case (December 2005), Applicant\nheld a current and valid Iranian passport, which he had made no effort to surrender.  The Judge found\nfor Applicant under Guideline C, which is not an issue on appeal.  The Judge did not discuss what\nsignificance Applicant\u2019s holding of a valid passport should have on his analysis of Applicant as a\nwhole person.  Such a failure is error.  Similarly, the Judge did not explain in his whole person\nanalysis how he resolved issues such as the systematic persecution Applicant\u2019s family is already\nsubject to and Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of his ties to the family members in Iran.  Cumulatively,\nthese errors warrant reversal.     \n\n5\n Order\nThe judgment of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Iran has a poor record of human rights, and there is evidence of summary executions, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and other degrading treatment of prisoners, and violence against women.

Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in Afghanistan.\nHe obtained a degree in Public Administration and Diplomacy in 1972 from Kabul University.\nApplicant attended a \u201cspecial program\u201d in the Academy of War, enabling him to satisfy his country\u2019s\none-year military service requirement.  From 1973 until 1975 he attended classes, wore a uniform,\nand held the position of \u201cThird Lieutenant.\u201d  The Judge found that \u201cmore likely than not, the\nApplicant served in the . . . Afghan military for a one year period.\u201d\nFollowing his participation in this program, Applicant worked for the Afghan government\nfrom 1973 until at least 1992 in a variety of positions, including First Secretary of the Afghan\nEmbassy in Japan; Director of Diplomatic Service and Member Protocol Department of the Afghan\nForeign Affairs Ministry; and President of the Deputy Prime Minister\u2019s Office.  In June 1992 he\nobtained an Afghan diplomatic passport, which was reissued on February 28, 2002 and extended to\nFebruary 27, 2004.  \nIn 1992 Applicant immigrated to the United States.  He became a naturalized citizen in 2000\nand was issued a valid U.S. passport.  In July 2002 Applicant started work for a company as a\ntranslator.  Although he changed jobs, he was working in Afghanistan as a translator in 2004 when\n\u201cit was determined that [his] security clearance eligibility was in question.\u201d  Applicant then returned\nto the U.S.\nOn November 11, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery.  His\ndefense attorney filed a motion with the court to dismiss the charge on the grounds that Applicant\nwas a diplomat of the government of Afghanistan, entitled to full immunity from prosecution.  \u201cThe\nMotion to Dismiss (Exhibit 3)  indicates that the Applicant possessed a valid diplomatic passport\nthat was extended until February 2004 and that he traveled to attend a conference in Germany in\n2002, wherein an interim government for the country of Afghanistan was formed.\u201d  \nAs to the facts underlying the charge, the Judge found that Applicant had gone to the hospital\nfor treatment following a fall from a ladder.  Applicant requested pain medication from a nurse\nwhereupon, according to three witnesses, Applicant spat in her face.  This information was found\n\nApplicant Exhibit A contains, among other things, Applicant\u2019s resume.  This document states that Applicant\n2\ngraduated from high school in 1968.  It also states that, the same year, he graduated from the Army Academy \u201cas a\nreserved [sic] officer.\u201d   While this might corroborate the view that Applicant had indeed served in the Afghan military,\n3\nin a Police Report included in Exhibit 3.  Applicant was convicted of the charge, sentenced to jail,\nand fined $100.    \nThe Judge found that Applicant answered three questions on the Security Clearance\nApplicant (SCA) falsely.  The first of the three was Question 11, which asked if he had ever served\nin the military, to include a foreign military service.  The next, Question 15, asked if, within the\nprevious seven years, Applicant had ever possessed a passport issued by a foreign government.\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to both of these questions.  The third, Question 16, asked if Applicant had\never traveled outside the U.S. on other than official U.S. business.  Applicant stated \u201cyes\u201d and listed\npleasure trips to Germany, the Netherlands, and France in 1996 and 2000.  However, he did not\nmention the trip to Germany in 2002, described in the Motion to Dismiss included in Exhibit 3.\nThe Judge included in her findings a summary of the evidence Applicant submitted in his\nown behalf.  These included the testimony of six character witnesses, to the effect that Applicant is\nreliable, trustworthy, and of high integrity.  These opinions were corroborated by numerous letters\nof recommendation.  The Judge held the record open for Applicant to submit additional information.\nApplicant\u2019s daughter submitted a statement to the effect that Applicant did not \u201cfalsify his\ndiplomatic passport\u201d but that she, the daughter, knows who did.  The Judge concluded that this\nsubmission was untimely and, in any event, was not of a nature to cast doubt on the validity of\nApplicant\u2019s diplomatic passport, included in Exhibit 3.   \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nApplicant has challenged the Judge\u2019s finding that he had served in the miliary of Afghanistan.\nHe also challenges the Judge\u2019s admission of Exhibit 3 on the grounds that it is hearsay.\n1.  Foreign Military Service: Applicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that he had\nserved in the Afghan military.  Applicant claims that he never actually entered active duty, attending\nthe Academy of War in a civilian capacity.  See, e. g., Tr. at 203.  In his appeal brief, Applicant\nanalogized his status to that of cadets at a U.S. military college, who are not in active duty status\nwhile pursuing their studies.  On the other hand, we note the Judge\u2019s finding that while performing\nthis service, Applicant wore a uniform and held an apparent military rank.  Additionally, in his\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant states, \u201cLike all other men in Afghanistan, I did serve my time with\nthe Afghan military.\u201d    We conclude that the Judge\u2019s finding is based upon substantial evidence.\n2\n\nwe note that it is five years prior to the earliest date of service referenced in the SOR and in the Judge\u2019s findings.  The\nJudge makes no reference to it in her decision, and neither party relies upon it in their appellate briefs.  Therefore, we\nhave disregarded this matter in resolving the issue on appeal.    \nThis is a different attorney from the one who represented Applicant at the hearing and upon this appeal.\n3\n4\nEven if the finding is in error, however, it is  not reasonably likely to have affected the outcome of\nthe case.  See ISCR 01-23362 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 at 5 (App. Bd.\nDec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  Therefore, any error would\nbe harmless.\n2.  Hearsay Nature of Court Documents: Applicant contends that it was error for the Judge\nto admit the documents contained in Exhibit 3 (Motion of Dismiss and Police Report) and to\nconsider them for the truth of such contested matters as Applicant\u2019s possessing a foreign passport;\nhaving traveled to Germany in 2002; and for the facts underlying the assault charge.  \nIn DOHA proceedings, the Federal Rules of Evidence service only as a guide.  They may be\nrelaxed by the Judge (with one exception not applicable to this appeal) in order to permit the\ndevelopment of a full and complete record by the parties.  Directive \u00b6  E3.1.19.  By design, the\nDOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side of initially admitting evidence into the record\nand then to consider a party\u2019s objections when deciding what, if any, weight to give to that evidence.\nBecause DOHA proceedings are conducted before impartial, professional fact finders, there is less\nconcern about the potential prejudicial effect of specific items of evidence than there is in judicial\nproceedings conducted before a lay jury.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-11571 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb.\n8, 2007). \n In this case, the Motion to Dismiss was prepared by Applicant\u2019s attorney,  who certified\n3\nunder penalty of perjury that the facts contained therein, including a copy of the Afghan passport,\nwere true.  Furthermore, the Police Report was detailed, internally consistent, bore the name and\nbadge number of the investigating police officer, and was an official record prepared for a purpose\nother than at DOHA.  We have examined the documents and conclude that they possess sufficient\nindicia of reliability so as to have been admissible in Applicant\u2019s hearing.  See ISCR Case No. 01-\n02677 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002) (Internal company investigation report containing evidence of\napplicant misconduct admissible insofar as it possessed \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d).  We\nconclude that the Judge did not err in admitting the documents contained in Exhibit 3.  Furthermore,\nwe hold that the Judge\u2019s findings that are drawn from this exhibit are based upon substantial\nevidence.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\n\n5\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert den 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).  \nApplicant contends that his evidence and testimony satisfied his burden of persuasion as to\nthe relevant mitigating conditions.  The Board does not find that contention persuasive.  We do not\nagree with Applicant.  Even if one assumes that her finding as to Applicant\u2019s military service was\nerror,  the remaining findings  support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his\nburden of persuasion as to the security concerns raised under Guidelines C, J, and E.  These findings\ninclude his possession and use of a foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, as reflected in the\nMotion to Dismiss; his lengthy service to the government of Afghanistan; and his criminal conduct,\nto include the false answers to Questions 15 and 16.  The Judge also noted numerous unresolved\ninconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s version of the pertinent events and that contained in the\nGovernment\u2019s evidence.  Accordingly, we hold that her adverse clearance decision is not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Jean E.

YOUNG\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPersonal Representative\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant mitigated security concerns raised by (1) her possession and use of a Turkish passport after she became a\nU.S. citizen and obtained a U.S. passport, and (2) the presence of members of her family and her husband's family\nin Turkey. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan 2. 1992), as amended, DOHA\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 21 July 2005 detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised\nunder Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive. Applicant answered\nthe SOR in writing on 31 August 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to another judge on 2 November 2005. He scheduled the hearing for 19 December 2005, but was unable\nto attend due to illness. The case was reassigned to me on 19 December 2005, and I convened a hearing on that\ndate to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 5 January 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant was born in Turkey in 1968. She works as a marketing researcher for a defense contractor for whom she\n\nhas been employed for seven years. Both her supervisor and the director of security believe she is an excellent\nworker and should be granted a clearance.\nApplicant received her education, including a master's degree, in Turkey. Her parents are both citizen residents of\nTurkey. Her parents are retired. Her mother did not have a job outside the home. Tr. 27. Her father owns an office\nbuilding on which he collects rent. Applicant had one sibling, a brother, but he died in 1997.\nIn 1994, she met her husband in Turkey while he was visiting his family there. They married in 1995 and Applicant\ncame to the U.S. in 1996 on her Turkish passport. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2000 and was\nissued a U.S. passport in September of that year. Her Turkish passport did not expire until May 2005, so she used it\nto enter and exit Turkey on her nearly yearly visits there. Although she and family did not travel to Turkey in 2005,\nthey intend to go there in 2006. They try to stay for a month each year. While in Turkey, she visits family and\nfriends there. Her mother visited Applicant in the U.S. on a yearly basis, but since Applicant's son was born, she\noften visits twice a year. Tr. 28. Applicant's father has not visited the U.S. Applicant communicates with her\nmother a couple times a week (Tr. 28), her father every two weeks (Tr. 29), and some of her friends three or four\ntimes a year.\nHer Turkish passport expired in May 2005, and she does not intend to renew it. Tr. 34. Applicant had her husband\ntry to surrender her Turkish passport to the Turkish Embassy. The Embassy refused to take it because it had\nalready expired. Applicant is hesitant to renounce her Turkish citizenship because it may affect her ability to inherit\nfrom her parents. Tr. 26-27. She now believes she might still be able to inherit even if she renounced her Turkish\ncitizenship. If she inherited assets in Turkey, she thinks she would sell them. Currently, she has no foreign assets.\nApplicant's husband is a U.S. citizen by birth. He was born in the U.S. in 1964 of Turkish-born parents. Both of his\nparents had become naturalized U.S. citizens. When he was six years old, his parents divorced, and he moved to\nTurkey with his mother. He completed high school in Turkey and, when he was 17 or 18 years old, he returned to\nthe U.S., where he received his higher education. Tr. 33-34. He has worked for the U.S. Navy for the past 16-17\nyears and holds a security clearance.\nApplicant believes her husband's father lives in the U.S., but they do not have contact with him. His mother is\nretired from working at a leather company. Tr. 30. She is now married to an economist for a privately controlled\npharmaceutical company, and they live in Turkey. He is also a dual U.S./Turkish citizen. Applicant talks to them\nabout once every two weeks and visits them in Turkey during the family's visits there. Applicant's mother-in-law\nvisits Applicant and her family in the U.S. every year. Tr. 30.\nTurkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system. The country has a market economy. The\nTurkish government has generally respected the human rights of its citizen, and has carried out substantial legal\nreforms to meet the requirements for entry into the European Union. Ex. 6 at 1. Turkey is a member of NATO and\nhas been a staunch U.S. counterterrorism ally in the global war on terrorism. Ex. 7 at 54.\nPOLICIES\n\"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance.\" Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As\nCommander in Chief, the President has \"the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give\nthat person access to such information.\" Id. at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \"only upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\" Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\n\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive. An applicant \"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\" ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive. The decision\nto deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C-Foreign Preference\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Turkey (\u00b6 1.a); she possessed a Turkish\npassport that expired in May 2005 (\u00b6 1.b); and she used her Turkish passport to travel to Turkey at least four times\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen (\u00b6 1.c). In her answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. When an applicant\nacts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S. Directive \u00b6 E2.A3.1.1.\nThe Government established each of the allegations in the SOR. But maintaining dual nationality is not a\npotentially disqualifying condition. Conditions that could raise the foreign preference security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include the exercise of dual citizenship (DC E2.A3.1.2.1) and the possession and/or use of a foreign\npassport (DC E2.A3.1.2.2). \nTo be disqualifying, an applicant must have exercised her foreign citizenship. As the allegation in \u00b6 1.a fails to\nallege any exercise of dual citizenship, I find for Applicant.\nAfter she became a U.S. citizen, and until it expired in 2005, Applicant continued to use her Turkish passport to\nenter and exit Turkey, despite having obtained a U.S. passport in 2000. By doing so, she was able to avoid\nsubstantial visa fees. Answer at 1. She still possesses the expired Turkish passport, but now travels only on her\nU.S. passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport is an exercise of dual citizenship. Using the passport for\nher personal convenience-saving money on visa fees-is not mitigating. See ISCR Case No. 02-02052 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 8, 2003). \nA clearance must \"be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official\napproval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government.\" Memo. from Arthur L. Money,\nAsst Sec. Def. Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, to Directors of Defense Agencies, Guidance\nto DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative\nGuideline (Aug. 16, 2000). Although it appears from the context of the Memo, that Assistant Secretary Money\nintended the memo to apply to valid passports, the Appeal Board has held otherwise. ISCR Case No. 01-24306 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 30, 2003). I am required to follow the Appeal Board's decisions. ISCR Case No. 03-16516 at 4\n(App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2004). But in this case, Applicant attempted to surrender the passport to the appropriate\nTurkish authorities and was rebuffed. Under the circumstances, I conclude Applicant has taken all reasonalbe steps\nto surrender her Turkish passport. I find for Applicant on \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.\n\nGuideline B-Foreign Influence\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's parents (\u00b6 2.a) and her husband's mother and stepfather (\u00b6 2.b) are citizen\nresidents of Turkey; and Applicant traveled to Turkey at least eight times since 1997 (\u00b6 2.c). In her answer,\nApplicant admitted each of the allegations. A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or\nother persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may\nbe subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information. Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1. The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign\ncountry, as well as each individual family tie, must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2003).\nThe Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of a potentially\ndisqualifying condition under Guideline B-Applicant has members of her immediate family, and persons to whom\nshe has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens, resident, and present in a foreign county. DC\nE2.A2.1.2.1. While the possession of such ties is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying, it does raise a prima facie\nconcern sufficient to require an applicant to rebut or mitigate it. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59\nat **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). It is also disqualifying for an applicant to live with a person-in this case her\nhusband-if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists. DC E2.A2.1.2.2. The question arises\nbecause Applicant's husband's mother and stepfather are citizens and residents of Turkey.\nAs the evidence established a potential disqualifying condition, Applicant had the burden to produce evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The security concerns raised by Applicant's\nforeign associates may be mitigated when it is determined they are not agents of a foreign power and are not in a\nposition to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person involved and loyalty to the U.S. MC E2.A2.1.3.1. \nApplicant's foreign associates are not \"agents of a foreign power.\" See 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b). The record supports a\nconclusion that Applicant's foreign associates do not act on behalf of a foreign power, engage in terrorism, or\nengages in clandestine intelligence or sabotage activities.\nIn assessing the vulnerability to exploitation of Applicant's associates, it is helpful to consider several factors,\nincluding the character of the government and the status of the country involved. Even friendly nations can have\nprofound disagreements with the U.S. over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national\nsecurity. We know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the U.S., especially in the economic,\nscientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29,\n2002). Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record\nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion.\nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian\ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to\ntarget U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\nAfter carefully evaluating all of the evidence, I conclude MC E2.A2.1.3.1 applies to Applicant's case. Turkey is an\nally of the U.S. and is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. While there is a risk of\nterrorism in Turkey, as there is in much of the rest of the world today, including the U.S., I conclude the risk is\nsuch that Applicant's family members are not in a position to be exploited in a way that could force her to choose\nbetween loyalty to the U.S. and loyalty to her family and associates. I find for Applicant on \u00b6 2.\n\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: For Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJames A. Young\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 31, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)  advising Applicant\n1\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August\n28, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Phillip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable conclusion\nunder Guideline E regarding Applicant\u2019s past drug use was error, given the fact that the Judge found\nin Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the same drug use under Guideline H; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable conclusions about Applicant\u2019s falsifications were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  The Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision. \nApplicant devotes a significant portion of his appeal brief speaking to the issue of his\ncriminal conduct that was alleged under Guideline J, and portions of which were alleged under\nGuideline E.  The Board need not comment on Applicant\u2019s various factual expositions and\narguments in this area since the Judge made formal findings in favor of Applicant under Guideline\nJ and those portions of Guideline E dealing with his criminal conduct, and there was no cross-appeal\nby Department Counsel.\nApplicant notes that the Judge ultimately found in his favor regarding an allegation of 1998\ndrug use, but then ruled against him when the same substantive conduct was alleged under Guideline\nE.   Applicant appears to be arguing that Guideline E does not provide any independent basis for an\nadverse formal finding after the Judge made a favorable formal finding under Guideline H involving\nthe same conduct.  Applicant\u2019s argument lacks merit.  An Applicant\u2019s security related conduct can\nbe alleged under more than one Guideline and, in an appropriate case, can be given independent\nweight by an administrative judge under different guidelines.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05072\nat 6 (App. Bd. July 14, 2005).  In this case, there is a rational basis for an SOR allegation involving\nApplicant\u2019s drug use to be included under both Guideline H and Guideline E, and it was therefore\nlegally permissible for the Judge to consider Applicant\u2019s conduct under both and to reach different\nconclusions under both, so long as the Judge articulated a rational basis for his conclusions.  Here,\nthe Judge based his unfavorable conclusion under Guideline E on the fundamental concern of that\nGuideline relating to conduct demonstrating a lack of judgment and trustworthiness.  The Judge\nrelied to a considerable extent on Applicant\u2019s use of drugs while he held a DoD security clearance\nas a basis for his unfavorable resolution of the conduct under Guideline E.  Such a resolution is not\ninconsistent with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the same conduct was mitigated under Guideline H,\ninasmuch as that Guideline, unlike Guideline E, does not explicitly express a concern about conduct\nthat reflects adversely upon aspects of applicant\u2019s judgment or trustworthiness that go beyond drug\nuse. \nApplicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by\nfailing to disclose adverse information about his drug use, criminal involvements, and security\nclearance revocation.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\n\n3\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question on his security clearance application.  The Judge was not bound,\nas a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision\nreveals that the Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record evidence as a whole,\nand concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate and\nintentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s unfavorable conclusions\nregarding falsification are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n          \nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is  AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffery D.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant has held a security clearance since 1991 without a security incident. He has an excellent work record and he performs volunteer work for the United Way and the American Cancer Society. He also serves as a tutor at a local school. Applicant went to a grocery store in 2000 and purchased over $100 worth of groceries. Security guards stopped him on suspicion of not paying for an item. Applicant had a strong odor of alcohol about him. When Applicant refused to cooperate by providing the guards with personal information and by refusing to turn over the item in question, a tube of anti-fungal cream, the guards called the police. Upon the arrival of the police, Applicant turned over the cream. He was arrested for shoplifting and searched. The police discovered in Applicant\u2019s pants pocket a package of cheese for which he had not paid. Subsequently, Applicant made known to his attorney, the prosecutor, and the judge that he was concerned about the effect the incident would have on his clearance.

Blank, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJerry L. Tanenbaum, Esq.\n\nQuestion 26 reads in pertinent part: \u201cThe single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under\n1\nthe Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C.\n844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 26, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 12, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge James A. Young denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in admitting\ndocumentary evidence that pertained to an offense expunged under state law and which was hearsay;\nwhether the Judge erred by not mitigating the security concerns raised in the SOR; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s whole person analysis fails to comply with the requirements of Directive  \u00b6  E2.2.1.  Finding\nno error, we affirm. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has held a security\nclearance since 1991 without a security incident.  He has an excellent work record and he performs\nvolunteer work for the United Way and the American Cancer Society.  He also serves as a tutor at\na local school.  \nApplicant went to a grocery store in 2000 and purchased over $100 worth of groceries.\nSecurity guards stopped him on suspicion of not paying for an item.  Applicant had a strong odor of\nalcohol about him.  When Applicant refused to cooperate by providing the guards with personal\ninformation and by refusing to turn over the item in question, a tube of anti-fungal cream, the guards\ncalled the police.  Upon the arrival of the police, Applicant turned over the cream.  He was arrested\nfor shoplifting and searched.  The police discovered in Applicant\u2019s pants pocket a package of cheese\nfor which he had not paid.\nSubsequently, Applicant made known to his attorney, the prosecutor, and the judge that he\nwas concerned about the effect the incident would have on his clearance.  He was permitted to plead\nguilty to a lesser included offense and pay a small fine.  His attorney, the prosecutor, and the judge\nassured him that the knowledge about his case would not go beyond the local jurisdiction.\nAdditionally, in January 2006, Applicant had the conviction expunged from his record.\nIn filling out his security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 26.\nThis question asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been arrested for, charged with,\nor convicted of, any offense not otherwise reported on the application form.  The question states that\nApplicant was to answer the question even if the conviction had been sealed or otherwise stricken\nfrom the record.  The only exception was for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled\nSubstances Act.   \n1\n\n3\nOn July 15, 2004, a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent questioned Applicant about the\nunderlying incident.  Applicant \u201csaid [the item] may have been left in his cart and not scanned, but\nhe wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d  Applicant stated that he assumed the incident would not be uncovered due to the\nexpungement and also stated that his attorney had advised him \u201cthat after 36 months the proceeding\nwould be removed from his record.\u201d\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nApplicant has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue in this\ncase. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nApplicant contends that it was error for the Judge to admit and consider certain documents,\nspecifically an FBI identification record pertaining to Applicant; a DSS report of investigation\nsummarizing the investigating agent\u2019s interview with Applicant; and the police record pertaining to\nApplicant\u2019s shoplifting incident.  Applicant argues that these documents were \u201chearsay witness\nstatements that have been expunged\u201d from his record and, therefore, the Judge should not have\nadmitted them.   \nThe Board does not agree with Applicant\u2019s position.  Expungement of an offense does not\nrelieve Applicant of the responsibility to provide truthful answers.  The only exception pertains to\nthe Federal Controlled Substances Act, which is not the case here.  Applicant\u2019s argument is further\nweakened by the fact that the court which ordered the expungement was a state court.  See ISCR\nCase No. 03-22563 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (\u201c[T]he federal government is not bound by state\nlaw concerning the expungement of state criminal convictions . . . [and] can require a person\n\n4\napplying for a . . .  security clearance to disclose information about his criminal record even if it has\nbeen expunged.\u201d)(internal citations omitted).     \nNeither did the documents\u2019 hearsay character impair their admissibility in this instance.  The\ndocuments had reasonable indicia of reliability\u2013two of the documents were official records that had\nbeen prepared for purposes other than litigation at DOHA; the other document was an official record\nmemorializing an agent\u2019s observations and the Applicant\u2019s admissions.  In DOHA proceedings, the\nFederal Rules of Evidence service only as a guide.  They may be relaxed by the Judge (with one\nexception not applicable to this appeal) in order to permit the development of a full and complete\nrecord by the parties.  Directive E3.1.19.  By design, the DOHA process encourages Judges to err\non the side of initially admitting evidence into the record and then to consider a party\u2019s objections\nwhen deciding what, if any, weight to give to that evidence.  Because DOHA proceedings are\nconducted before impartial, professional fact finders, there is less concern about the potential\nprejudicial effect of specific items of evidence than there is in judicial proceedings conducted before\na lay jury.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-11571 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2007).  Given the record in\nthis case, the Judge did not err in admitting the documents into evidence.  Furthermore, the weight\nwhich he assigned to the documents was not arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 98-0619 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 1999).        \nConcerning the remaining issues on appeal, we note that \u201cthere is a strong presumption\nagainst granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990),\nth\ncert den 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does\nnot turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather,\ntheir application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions that might apply in\nApplicant\u2019s case.  Given his findings, we conclude that his analysis of them is not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Likewise the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is sustainable.  He took\ninto account record evidence favorable to Applicant, such as the fact that he apparently received\nsome inadequate advice from his counsel and from other court officials regarding the legal\nimplications of an expungement order.  The Judge\u2019s findings of fact demonstrate that he also took\ninto account Applicant\u2019s work record and charitable activities.  \nHowever, the Judge noted the fact that Question 26 is clear on its face, and Applicant, an\neducated man, had no reason to believe that he was excused from answering it truthfully.  The Judge\nwent on to say, \u201cEven at the hearing, he was still trying to suggest that the incident was so minor it\ndid not warrant reporting\u201d in support of his conclusion that Applicant has not fully accepted\nresponsibility for his actions.  Decision at 4.  Considering the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record\nas a whole, we conclude that his whole person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive\n\u00b6  E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  Accordingly, we conclude that the\nJudge\u2019s decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   \n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned; Jean E.
