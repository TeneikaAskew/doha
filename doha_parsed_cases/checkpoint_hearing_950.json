This case was assigned to me on May 3, 2023. A hearing was scheduled for \nJuly 14, 2023, via Microsoft Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard as \nscheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and 14 exhibits (AEs A-N). The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on July 25, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated four delinquent \ndebts exceeding $23,000. Allegedly, his delinquent debts remain unresolved and \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations and clarifications. He claimed his second spouse ran off with the vehicle \ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.in 2015 and refused to return it, resulting in the vehicle\u2019s being \nlater recovered by the seller and sold at auction for less than the amount owed. He \nfurther claimed that the car lender did not initially pursue a deficiency against him. He \nalso claimed that his most recent wife was responsible for the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt, which he \nis paying through a payoff agreement. He claimed, too, to have made $200 monthly \npayments to SOR creditor 1.c through March 2020 before defaulting for lack of funding. \nAddressing SOR creditor 1.d, He claimed that the vehicle pay loss covered by the car \nloan from the creditor was destroyed by fire in December 2020 and should have been \nreimbursed by gap insurance in early 2021. And, Applicant expressed remorse over his \nallowing his soon-to-be ex-spouse (i.e., his third wife) to handle their finances during \ntheir relationship. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 31-32) \nSince October April 2014, Applicant has worked for his current employer as an \ninspector. (GE 1) He reported brief periods of unemployment in 2013. (GE 1; Tr. 37, 46) \nHe has held a full security clearance since July 2007. (GE 1; Tr. 74) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2010 and 2019, Applicant accumulated four delinquent accounts \nexceeding $23,000. (GEs 2-4) The SOR-listed debts are listed as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n(an individual account opened in 2013 with a $12,969 balance); 1.b (an individual \naccount opened in 2010 with a $5,224 balance); 1.c (an individual account opened in \n2012 with a $5,194 balance); and 1.d (a joint account opened in 2019 with a $979 \nbalance). (GEs 2-3; Tr. 35-39) \nApplicant attributed his debt delinquencies to a number of sources. He cited his \nsecond wife\u2019s becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol, running off with his car in April \n2015 and refusing to return it. (GE 2; Tr. 36) Unable to recover the car on his own, he \ncontacted local police, who recovered the vehicle in May 2015. With no assistance \nforthcoming from either the police or his lender, he settled on letting his lender \nrepossess the vehicle with the help of a towing company. (Applicant\u2019s response)) \nAccording to Applicant, the car was sold at auction for less than the amount owed on \nthe vehicle, leaving a deficiency balance covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a. After being informed by \nthe car lender of its decision not to pursue collection of a deficiency balance, he \nreceived a deficiency letter from a collection agent several months later, demanding \npayment of the deficiency balance owing after the auction sale. He iignored the latter \nfrom the collection agent and has since lost all of the documentation pertaining to \ncollection during his numerous moves. (Tr. 36) \nAddressing the alleged $979 balance owing the creditor covered by SOR \u00b6l 1.d, \nApplicant continues to dispute any balance owing the creditor on his third wife\u2019s car \nloan. (Applicant\u2019s response and AEs F and K; Tr. .54, 57) The dispute can be traced to \nApplicant\u2019s financing of a purchase of a new vehicle in April 2019 for $48,102. (GE 2) In \nDecember 2020, the car, along with his tools, were destroyed in a shop fire. (GE 4 and \nAEs B, F and K) With his gap insurance, he secured a measure of financial relief. His \ngap insurance carrier, in turn, covered its assessed value of the vehicle with a final \npayment of $31,213 in January 2021. (AEs B and F) However, his car lender disputed \nthe gap insurer\u2019s total loss payment, claiming the payment was not enough to pay off \nthe car loan. (AE K) Whether the additional approved $7,111 insurance payment \nearmarked for his car lender payee was enough to cover any shortfall from the loss of \nthe vehicle is unclear. (AEs B and K) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s account, his dispute with his SOR \u00b6 1.d creditor has \nnever been resolved, and the lender has continued to hold him responsible for the $979 \nshortfall. (Applicant\u2019s response and AE K) Still believing the gap insurance loss payoff \nshould have relieved him of any further loan responsibilities, he has never paid the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlender its claimed $979 loan balance. (AE K) Subsequent efforts by him to enlist the \ndivorce court\u2019s assistance in revising the parties\u2019 settlement agreement to direct his ex-\nspouse to pay off any remaining balance on the SOR \u00b6 1.d debt were unsuccessful. \n(AEs H-I) \nApplicant cited additional burdens placed on his finances by the 2023 child \nsupport and alimony order imposed on him based on the claims of his third wife, and his \nown failures to make more concerted follow-up checks on the status of the delinquent \naccounts in issue. (AEs L and O-Q; Tr. 38-56, 78) His furnished documentation does \nvalidate his efforts to refinance his home in 2022 to increase his available cash to better \naddress his remaining debts. (AE N) While his efforts to refinance his home were \nunsuccessful, they reflect good-faith attempts on his part to resolve his debts. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he has since resolved two of his debt delinquencies with \neither payoffs or payment agreements. He documented his resolution of his SOR \u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c accounts with payment agreements and a lump sum payoff of his SOR \u00b6 1.b \naccount. (AEs E and R; Tr. 41-44, 46-49) At the time of his settlement agreements, the \nSOR 1.b debt was in collection status; while the SOR 1.c debt was charged off. (GEs 2-\n4) He had fallen behind with these debts during a period of unemployment in 2013. \n(Applicant\u2019s response and AE J) By the time he learned that his second spouse had not \ntaken care of the account, the account had become delinquent.  \nSimilar circumstances prevented Applicant from timely addressing his SOR \u00b6 1.c \ndebt payments. As a divorcee, Naval reservist, and single and custodial parent, \nresponsible for his two sons, he encountered tough sledding in keeping up with all of his \ndebts and let his SOR \u00b6 1.c account slip into delinquent status. (AE J) Complicating his \nability to address this account were the child support orders obtained by his first wife \nwho had regained custody of Applicant\u2019s sons. (AE J) Meeting his monthly child support \nobligations compounded his already strained finances. \nApplicant currently earns $130,000 a year in base salary and another $5,000 a \nyear in earned overtime with his latest promotion. (Tr. 34) Preceding his promotion, he \nearned $110,000 annually after starting with an entrance salary of $100,000. (Tr. 34-\n35). Before his divorce, his third wife contributed financially to his family with part-time \nwork. (Tr. 35) Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses consist of mortgage payments ($2,000), car \npayments ($2,000), food ($1,000); car insurance ($250); utilities ($100-$300); and child \nsupport and alimony payments ($1,700). (GE 4; Tr. 47-48, 51-53) He estimated a \nmonthly remainder of $1,200 to $1,500, which he has used in the past to cover medical \nand plumbing issues. (Tr. 47)  \nEndorsements and awards \nApplicant is well-regarded by his supervisors and colleagues. (AE D) Between \n2018 and 2023, he received letters of recognition recognizing his contributions to his \nteam\u2019s operations. His military awards include the Navy and Marine Corps. \nAchievement Medals awarded for his recognized contributions.

Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds  .  .  .  .

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of four \ndelinquent debts exceeding $23,000. These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). In \nApplicant\u2019s case, his debt delinquencies are attributable to several contributing factors: \nspousal lapses in addressing their respective joint creditor responsibilities, unexpected \nchild and alimony payments associated with his recent 2023 divorce, and his own \nlapses in failing to follow up on the status of his debts in issue. \nApplicable mitigating conditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance\u201d; 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and \nis adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d; \nand 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue.\u201d While Applicant has been dilatory about monitoring and addressing his debts, \nextenuating circumstances and mitigating conditions have been major factors. Overall, \nhis debt management initiatives have been encouraging and helped him to meet his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                                \n  \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nevidentiary burdens of demonstrating the responsible requirements for managing his \nfinances. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track record \nof actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance associated with the \nresponsible and good-faith payment requirements of MCs \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d). \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions, his \nextenuating circumstances associated with his spousal contributory actions, his brief \nperiods of unemployment, his unexpected accruals of child support and alimony \npayment obligations, and his own partial payment lapses, he has shown sufficient \nresponsibility in managing his finances to date to enable him to maintain sufficient \ncontrol of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

He completed the program in May 2020, and \nwas awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant has never been married and does not have \nchildren. \nApplicant completed his first SCA in March 2021, while being sponsored by the \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (Customs). He disclosed that Customs determined \nhe was ineligible for a security clearance and thus denied his request for a clearance. \n(Item 4 at 7, and Item 3 at 60) He previously disclosed in his SCA that he purchased and \nused marijuana from September 2016 through February 2021, and that the frequency of \nhis marijuana use was \u201capproximately 4-5 times per month.\u201d He stated he used marijuana \nfor \u201cstress relief.\u201d (Item 2 at 43 through 44) He also indicated his intention to continue \nusing marijuana in the future, responding \u201cyes\u201d to this question. (Item 2 at 44) \nApplicant subsequently completed his second nearly identical SCA in November \n2021, this time, sponsored by a defense contractor. (Item 3) He made additional updated \ndisclosures in his second SCA. For example, he disclosed he continued to use marijuana \nthrough September 2021, with the same frequency and for the same stated purpose of \nstress relief. He also continued to purchase marijuana during this period. He did not \ninclude the additional dates because marijuana, he stated, was no longer illegal in his \nstate. Rather than through friends and others, he purchased marijuana through a state \ndispensary. (Item 3 at 57 through 59) He again stated his intention to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. (Item 3 at 58) \nIn his February 2022 interview, after the investigator informed him using marijuana \nwas federally illegal, Applicant stated he would discontinue using marijuana if this affects \nhis job and that he would have no future intent.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifications under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s \ndrug involvement is recent and frequent. He has taken no action to discontinue his \nfederally illegal use of marijuana. Instead, he doubled down on his stated desire and \nintention to continue possessing and using marijuana in the future. Finally, he has never \nreceived treatment or counseling for his use of marijuana. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement security concerns. He is not a suitable candidate for access \nto classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant used marijuana from \nJune 2016 to June 2019 at times, while possessing a security clearance. Applicant \nstated that she is no longer using marijuana, and that she has no intentions of ever \nusing it in the future. Her credibility is in question. Given the fact that she was not \nhonest and truthful about her illegal drug use in the first place, her actions have not \nbeen mitigated. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted \nwith the facts, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncause or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or \na person with professional responsibilities for advising or \ninstructing \nthe \nindividual \nspecifically \nconcerning \nsecurity \nprocesses. \nUpon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated \nfully and truthfully. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed \nto untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and \nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant lied about her illegal drug use on her June 2017 security clearance \napplication. \nShe knew or should have known to follow the instructions on the \napplication and answer the question honestly. She contends that she was a young and \nimmature engineer at the time. However, this is no excuse for her misconduct. As a \nresult of the false information she provided, she obtained a security clearance under \nfalse pretenses. Her lack of credibility gives the government no confidence that she will \nvoluntarily comply with required rules and regulations imposed in order to properly \nprotect classified information. To be eligible for access to classified information an \nindividual must demonstrate sufficient maturity and responsibility, often requiring them \nto self-report their misconduct. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose her marijuana use on her \nJune 2017 security clearance application falls short of meeting the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information, and clearly demonstrates dishonesty, \nunreliability, and untrustworthiness that is not tolerated by the defense department. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant has chosen to live her life to her \nconvenience, and disregarded Federal law, knowing that the use of any illegal drug is \nagainst DoD policy. Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant does not show the \nrequisite character or judgment of someone who has the maturity, integrity, and \nreliability necessary to access classified information. At this time, Applicant does not \nmeet the eligibility qualifications for a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified information. She \nunderstands the requirements associated with holding a security clearance and knows \nthat illegal drug use is not tolerated. \nApplicant is not an individual in whom the \nGovernment can be confident that she will always follow rules and regulations and do \nthe right thing, even when no one is looking. At this time, Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct and Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a   \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nApplicant\u2019s equivocal answers to questions about his future use of marijuana are \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(g) (\u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse; or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nuse\u201d). However, his failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue his \nmarijuana use was not alleged in the SOR. Thus, I have considered his equivocal \nanswers for the limited purposes of evaluating the evidence of mitigation and as part of \nmy whole person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established for Applicant\u2019s isolated instances of experimentation \nwith Ecstasy, cocaine, opium, mushrooms, prescription stimulants, and prescription pain \nkillers while he was in high school and college. It is not established for his use of \nmarijuana, which is recent and frequent. His equivocal response to the question in the \nSeptember 2022 interrogatories, asking whether he will use marijuana again, precludes \na finding that his use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. A security clearance investigation \nis not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or parse the truth narrowly. See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) His answers to questions about future drug \ninvolvement fall short of a clear and convincing commitment to discontinue his use of \nmarijuana. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant used marijuana as recently as \nSeptember 2022. He continues to associate with marijuana users and has not changed \nthe environment where marijuana is used. He has not provided the statement of intent \nprovided for in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug \ninvolvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineer employed by defense contractors since \nOctober 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 1989 to July 2009 and \nretired as a senior chief petty officer (pay grade E-8). He was employed by the Navy after \nretiring until January 2011. He was employed by federal contractors until April 2020, when \nhe was fired after he was arrested for driving under the influence. He was hired by a \ndefense contractor in February 2021 and hired by his current employer in August 2021. \nHe contracted COVID-19 in September, was hospitalized until October 2021, and \nreturned to work in November 2021. He received 80% of his regular pay while he was \nrecovering. (GX 3 at 2) He held a security clearance in the Navy and continued to hold it \nas a civilian employee and as an employee of a federal contractor. \nApplicant married in December 1992, divorced in April 2014, and remarried in \nNovember 2014. He adopted his current wife\u2019s three children, twins born in October 2002 \nand a daughter born in September 2000, to remove them from an abusive relationship, \nand he incurred substantial legal expenses to do so. (Answer; Tr. 20; GX 1 at 26-29) He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2020 and is working toward a master\u2019s degree. \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts, reflected in credit reports from October \n2022 (GX 4), December 2021 (GX 5), and January 2021 (GX 6). Applicant told a security \ninvestigator that his ex-wife had opened many credit accounts in his name and without \nhis knowledge and accumulated more debt than they could manage. (GX 2 at 8) The \nevidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Credit-card debt charged off for $30,071. This debt was a joint \naccount with Applicant\u2019s ex-wife. When they divorced, they agreed to divide the marital \nassets outside the court action, but they could not come to an agreement about some of \nthe debts.

In September 2019, the IRS assessed additional tax of $4,573, a \npenalty of $3,995, and interest of $2,909. Applicant made a $100 payment in January \n2020, which was dishonored.

(AX G) Applicant has not asserted that \nhe was the victim of any of the deceptive representations or unfair restrictions on his \naccount access. Instead, he testified that he asked the creditor to consolidate his home \nmortgage loan and two credit card accounts into a single loan. He testified that he \nerroneously thought that the consolidation had occurred, that the mortgage on the home \nhad been foreclosed, and that the proceeds of the foreclosure sale had been used to pay \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure . . . to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

Applicant submitted documentary evidence that \nhe had disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but he provided no evidence that the \ndispute had been resolved in his favor or that the debt was otherwise resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Although Applicant has corresponded with the IRS \nregarding his tax debt, he had not resolved it as of the date the record closed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s long and \nhonorable service on active duty in the U.S. Navy, as a civilian employee of the Navy, \nand as a respected employee of a defense contractor. He was candid and sincere at the \nhearing. However, he has not overcome the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. In several instances, he described reasonable actions to resolve his debts, but he \nfailed to provide documentary evidence to support his testimony, even after being given \nadditional time to obtain and provide it. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On \nJanuary 4, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G, J, and E. The CAS acted under Executive Order \n(Exec.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April \n4, 2023, and the case was assigned to me on September 9, 2023. On September 22, \n2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on October 16, 2023. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the \ntestimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record \nopen until October 31, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR and the amended SOR, he admitted all the \nallegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March \n1996 to April 2019 when he was involuntarily retired with a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. He was a senior chief petty officer (pay grade E-8) when he retired. \nHe held a security clearance during his military service. \nApplicant was unemployed from April to August 2019. He worked for federal \ncontractors from August 2019 to July 2023. The record does not reflect the circumstances \nof his termination from employment in July 2023. At the time of the hearing, he had been \noffered a job by another defense contractor, contingent on favorable adjudication of his \napplication to continue his security clearance. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant married in April 2000 and has two daughters, ages 22 and 18. He and \nhis wife have lived separately since December 2021, but they are not legally separated. \n(Tr. 14-15) He attended college from July to September 2008 but did not receive a degree. \n(GX 1 at 10-11; Tr. 15-16) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to \nthe point of intoxication, from about May 2017 to at least January 2022. Applicant admitted \nthis allegation in his answer to the SOR. At the hearing, he testified that he was drinking \nevery night during this period and that he was \u201cgetting close\u201d to drinking every night to the \npoint of intoxication. (Tr. 25). \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of \nan incident that led to nonjudicial punishment for sexual assault in February 2018, an \nincident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in August 2020, \nand an incident leading to a charge of assault and battery on a family member in October \n2021.

Although Applicant \nadmitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR, I doubt that he fully understood what \nhe was admitting, because when he was asked at the hearing to describe what happened, \nhe described the sexual assault alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, which occurred in May 2017, while \nhe was assigned overseas. (Tr. 19) The FBI arrest record reflects an arrest that occurred \nin the United States in October 2017, but it does not list the offense that was the basis for \nthe arrest. (GX 3) There is no documentary evidence in the record reflecting the basis for \nthis arrest. I conclude that the part of SOR \u00b6 2.a that alleges an arrest is established, but \nthe part alleging that the arrest was for abusive sexual contact is not established by his \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR or any evidence in the record. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant received nonjudicial punishment in February \n2018 for sexual assault in violation of Article 120, Uniform Code of Military Justice. The \nassault occurred in May 2017. Applicant and group of fellow sailors were at a party, and \nApplicant was intoxicated. He came up from behind a female sailor, hugged her, touched \nher breast, and asked her if she would go to bed with him. Applicant appeared before his \ncommanding officer, was found guilty of a sexual assault, and received nonjudicial \npunishment of a forfeiture of $2,618 of his pay. In March 2018, he was referred to an \nadministrative separation board, which determined that he should be retained in the Navy. \nShortly after Applicant was punished, he was transferred to another command. In \nMarch 2019, he was notified that he was required to retire. He retired in April 2019 and \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions. (AX A) The Certificate of \nRelease or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214) recites that the reason for \nseparation was \u201csufficient service for retirement.\u201d (AX A) The DD Form 214 reflects that \nduring his military service, he received the Good Conduct Medal (six awards), \nOutstanding Military Volunteer Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal \n(three awards), the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, two letters of \nappreciation and commendation, and various service medals and qualification badges \nand ribbons. \nApplicant testified that his marital problems began after his retirement. While on \nactive duty, he was deployed frequently, and it was not until he was at home for a while \nthat he realized that his wife and a neighbor were drinking heavily and using drugs during \nthe day. He believed that they had been drinking and using drugs for a couple years \nbefore his retirement. (Tr. 40) \nApplicant attributed all the domestic violence incidents to his heavy drinking, \nfollowed by arguments with his wife. He testified that the incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c \noccurred in August 2020, when he was working nights and came home at about 11:30 \npm. He testified that his wife and her friend had been \u201cgetting wasted all day.\u201d He started \ndrinking and began arguing with his wife. His wife claimed that he pushed her, and he \nclaimed that he pushed her away when she was screaming \u201cin his face.\u201d His wife called \nthe police, and they told him, \u201cthey got to take somebody,\u201d and he was arrested.

Applicant\u2019s wife accused him of throwing a beer \ncan at her. Applicant\u2019s daughter called the police, and they arrested Applicant for assault \nand battery on a family member. (Tr. 29) At a court hearing a couple of months later, \nadjudication was deferred, conditioned on good behavior for two years. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant testified that he stopped drinking heavily after he and his wife separated. \nHe testified that he now limits himself to a couple beers while watching football and no \nlonger drinks hard liquor. He has not received any formal counseling or treatment for his \nalcohol consumption. He is not involved with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or any similar \norganization. (Tr. 33-34, 42) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set in AG \u00b6 21. \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on whether the \nconduct was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. \nThe determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. \nIf the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). Applicant \nadmitted that he consumed alcohol in excess until \u201cat least January 2022.\u201d After \nconsidering Applicant\u2019s long history of excessive alcohol consumption, his continued \nconsumption of alcohol, his failure to seek counseling or treatment, and his unsettled \nrelationship with his wife, whom he blames for his excessive drinking, I conclude that the \nevidence falls short of showing reform or rehabilitation or that his conduct is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. Although Applicant has acknowledged his \nmaladaptive alcohol use, he provided no evidence of counseling, treatment, or other \nsupportive measures such as participation in AA. For these reasons and the reasons in \nthe above discussion of AG \u00b6 23(a), I am not convinced that he has demonstrated an \nestablished pattern of modified consumption. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are established by the evidence: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established, for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nAG \u00b6 23(a). \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not fully established. The record does not reflect any criminal activity \nafter Applicant\u2019s last arrest in October 2021, and he apparently complied with the terms \nof his two-year probation. However, he submitted no evidence of a good post-Navy \nemployment record, job training, higher education, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to Applicant\u2019s drunken altercations with his wife in August \n2020 and October 2021. It is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s sexual assault on a female \nsailor in February 2018, which was a serious offense sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established by Applicant\u2019s sexual assault on a female sailor in \nFebruary 2018 and domestic violence in August 2020 and October 2021. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s domestic incidents were arguably \nminor, but his sexual misconduct with a female sailor was not minor. His behavior was\nnot infrequent and did not happen under unique circumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his behavior and \nhe is living apart from his wife, but he has not obtained counseling or taken other \nmeasures to deal with his excessive alcohol consumption. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 31-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense contractor since December 2020. He received an associate degree from a community college in 2015. He has never married and has no children. He was cleared for a public trust position by another government agency in 2018, but he has never held a security clearance. A credit report dated April 7, 2022, reflects six delinquent debts charged off for $12,833 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $7,622 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $7,124 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $4,800 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $2,900 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and $2,714 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). During an interview with a security investigator in April 2022, Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to a downturn in the economy due to COVID-19.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the above conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent and numerous. He submitted no evidence showing that they were incurred under \nunusual circumstances or circumstances largely beyond his control. He submitted no \nevidence of financial counseling, payments, or payment plans. He has not disputed any \nof the debts alleged in the SOR. In his answer to the SOR, he promised to resolve some \nof the debts by May 2023 and the rest by December 2023. However, promises to resolve \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Furthermore, evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. \nSee ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The Government\u2019s documents, identified as Items 1 through 5 in \nits FORM, and Applicant\u2019s FORM response, are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through1.d, 1.f through 1.l, and 1.n \nthrough 1.t, and she denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through1.b, 1.e, 1.m. She is 50 years old and \nunmarried. She has two adult children. She was unemployed from June 2011 to \nOctober 2012, April 2017 to February 2018, and January 2021 to July 2021. She \ngraduated from high school in 2005. She attended college in 2014 and 2021 without \nearning a degree. She was certified as a nurse aide and a home health aide in March \n2024. She has worked as a manufacturing operational technician for her current \nemployer since July 2021. She has never held a security clearance. (Items 1-2; FORM \nResponse) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had 7 delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$14,450 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.e, 1.i-1.j, 1.m-1.n), and 13 delinquent medical debts totaling \n$7,260 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.f-1.h,1.k-1.l, 1.o-1.t).

In her Answer, she stated that she worked with a consumer advocacy law firm in \nthe past to pay and remove inaccurate debts from her credit bureau report, but that \nseveral of those debts have reappeared. She stated that she was resolving her debts as \nshe could, while providing for a child in college, helping her eldest child with her \ngrandchildren, and maintaining her daily living expenses. She intends to purchase a \nhome. (Items 1-2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a $9,358 charged-off debt. Applicant stated in her Answer that this \naccount was paid and closed after her car was sold. This debt was not reported on the \nJuly and October 2022 credit bureau reports. (Items 1, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a $2,602 collection account involving an eviction action filed by \nApplicant\u2019s former landlord in September 2015. Applicant stated in her Answer that she \ndid not owe this debt. She provided documentation reflecting that the eviction action \nwas dismissed in October 2015. Her October 2022 credit bureau report reflects that she \nis disputing any debt associated with the collection agency in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Items 1, 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a $1,010 collection account. Applicant stated in her Answer that this \naccount was deleted from her credit bureau report because the creditor reported \nerroneous information.

She also stated that \nshe lacked the income to pay this debt due to her periods of unemployment. (Items 1, 3-\n5) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.n are two charged-off debts with the same creditor, for $498 \nand $224, respectively. Applicant stated in her Answer that these accounts were \ndeleted from her credit bureau report because the creditor reported erroneous \ninformation. They are not reported on her most recent credit bureau report from October \n2022. (Items 1, 3-4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.m is a $241 collection account. Applicant stated in her Answer that she \nnever received any services from this creditor. It is not reported on her most recent \ncredit bureau report from October 2022. (Items 1, 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.d, 1.f through 1.h, 1.k through 1.l, and 1.o through 1.t are \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent medical debts. She stated in her Answer that some of these \nmedical debts were paid by either her primary or secondary health insurance, and \nothers were deleted from her credit bureau report. A June 2018 credit bureau report \nreflects that she successfully disputed various medical debts, and they were \nconsequently deleted from her credit bureau report. She also provided health insurance \ndocumentation reflecting claims processed between 2018 and 2022, in which her \nmember responsibility was $0. She maintains that these claims are the same medical \ndebts as those alleged in the SOR. Her most recent credit bureau report does not list \nany delinquent medical debts. (Items 1-4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying her \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are established. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her delinquent debts. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Her documentation and the credit reports corroborate her \nstated efforts to dispute or otherwise resolve her delinquent debts. She acknowledged \nthat her period of unemployment affected her ability to pay SOR \u00b6 1.i. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.j, \n1.m, 1.n, and no medical debts are reported on her most recent credit bureau report \nfrom October 2022. That credit report reflects that she is disputing SOR \u00b6 1.b, as the \ncollection agency for that debt was associated with an eviction proceeding against her \nthat was dismissed in 2015. She believed she successfully disputed SOR \u00b6 1.e in 2018. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties do not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns arising from her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.t: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(AE 1) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nclassified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunpaid taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems can be attributed to the costs associated with \nmoving his family to the United States in 2011, furnishing their new home, his two \ndivorces, and the unemployment after he left a job to better his chance at receiving a \nnew kidney. Most of those expenses were beyond his control. \nAbout $120,000 from Applicant\u2019s 401(k) retirement account was disbursed to him \nafter he left his job in 2017. There were tax implications. He decided to \u201cday trade\u201d \nabout $50,000 in the stock market. He was unsuccessful, and he lost about $50,000. \nThat was irresponsible conduct and is a major reason Applicant still has financial \nproblems. Had he used that money to pay his taxes and some of his other debts, or \neven if he rolled the money over into another retirement account, it is likely his finances \nwould be significantly better. \nApplicant decided that he would address his taxes before his consumer debts. \nHe paid $300 toward his 2014 taxes in January 2020. He entered into an installment \nagreement with the IRS in February 2020. He regularly made the $600 payments, and \nmore recently the new amount of $552 per month. He still owes several thousand \ndollars for 2016 and more than $45,000 for 2017, but I believe his taxes will eventually \nbe paid. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the taxes are eventually paid. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to pay his taxes on time continues to raise \ndoubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations. \nThe mitigation provided by the installment plan is lessened because his tax debt \nresulted largely from his reckless conduct. \nApplicant has done nothing to address his consumer debts. He owes about \n$36,000 for debts alleged in the SOR, another $30,000 for a non-alleged debt, and \nabout $50,000 to the IRS. He stated that he plans to pay his consumer debts after he \npays his taxes. That could take years, and intentions to resolve financial problems in the \nfuture are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \nconsumer debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \nthrough 20(d) do not apply. Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 through 4, was provided to \nApplicant, who received the file on October 17, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

Based upon a review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 43 years old, unmarried, and has no children. He served in the U.S. \nNavy from August 1997 until his medical discharge in October 1997. He has been \nemployed by a U.S. Government contractor as a project manager since December 2013. \nApplicant has held a security clearance in the past and seeks to renew his national \nsecurity eligibility in connection with his employment.

During \nhis security interview, he admitted that his untimeliness in filing his tax returns was due \nto laziness and forgetfulness.

Applicant submitted with his September 2022 Answer copies of \nhis Federal tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2017. The returns were self-prepared and \nare undated and unsigned. All four of the returns reflect that Applicant was entitled to \nrefunds ranging in amounts of $573 to $774. Applicant failed to provide a date or dates \nwhen he filed these tax returns. If the returns were in fact submitted, they had to have \nbeen filed after the November 2020 e-QIP and before the September 2022 Answer.

Applicant provided \nno documentation to support a finding that he in fact filed his TY 2013 Federal tax return, \nor that his return was filed as required, i.e., on or before April 15, 2014. Though not alleged \nin the SOR, Applicant also disclosed in the e-QIP that he had not filed his Federal tax \nreturn for TY 2009. He provided no comments about that Federal tax return. \n1.b.

Applicant responded to the Government\u2019s interrogatories \nin February 2022 and provided notices from his state government, dated September 9, \n2021. The notices covered the TYs 2014 through 2017. In the notices, the state \ngovernment advised Applicant that he was not eligible to receive refunds for these tax \nyears because his returns were filed more than three years after they were due. The \nnotices do not reflect when the returns for those tax years were filed, but they were likely \nfiled after his submission of the e-QIP in November 2020 in which he disclosed that his \nstate returns for the same years had not yet been filed. Applicant did not provide any \ninformation about his tax returns for TYs 2009 and 2013, which were both alleged in the \nSOR to have been filed untimely. He wrote in his response to the Government\u2019s \ninterrogatories that he lost the document for TY 2013. With his response, he also provided \ndocumentation evidencing that he had paid a state tax lien in the amount of $2,221. The \ndocumentation does not reflect what tax year the lien covered, though it noted the date \nof the lien as February 13, 2016. The SOR does not allege the existence of a state tax \nlien. (Item 3 at 7-14.) \nIn the November 2020 e-QIP, Applicant wrote that, \u201c2018 has been mailed to both \nstate and federal, 2019 has been received by both state and federal.\u201d He provided no \nfiling dates for any of those returns. The vague information provided does not confirm that \nthat any of the returns were timely filed. By not responding to the Government\u2019s FORM, \nApplicant provided no more recent information regarding his subsequent tax returns to \ndemonstrate that he has changed his past practice of untimely tax filings. Applicant also \nelected not to submit any information about his work performance or ability to safeguard \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant\u2019s admissions in the Answer and the \ne-QIP establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden of \nproof shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are not established. Applicant\u2019s untimely filing of tax \nreturns were frequent and did not occur under any unusual circumstances. In fact, \nthe circumstances were entirely under his control. He admitted that he was lazy \nand forgetful when it came to filing his tax returns on time for several years in a \nrow. Applicant presented no evidence to show a change in his behavior. His written \nstatements about his tax filings in 2018 and 2019 do not establish that he timely \nfiled those returns. He provided no evidence that untimely filings are unlikely to \nrecur. His behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is only partially established. Applicant provided notices from his \nstate government that he had filed his tax returns for the TYs 2014 through 2017. \nThe copies of his Federal tax returns for the same years were undated and \nunsigned and were not accompanied by any documentary evidence to establish \nthat they had been submitted, even if they were untimely. In fact, he provided no \npositive assertion that the returns had indeed been filed. Also, Applicant claimed \nwithout any supporting documentary evidence that he filed his TY 2013 Federal \nand state tax returns. His assertion that he lost the state notice with respect to TY \n2013 while retaining the notices for the four subsequent years is not credible. \nOverall, the evidence is insufficient to show that Applicant is willing to comply with \na basic rule, applicable to all U.S. taxpayers, to file tax returns in a timely manner. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial considerations. He has also not shown that there is little \nlikelihood of recurrence. The record evidence does not convince me that Applicant is \nreliable and has good judgment. Overall, the record evidence creates doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Having reviewed all of the mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20, \nI find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nI have considered condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts went into \ncollections between 2017 and 2021. That is not that long ago. The debts are numerous \nand remain in default today. His debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered condition AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant was divorced in September \n2020, after 12 years of marriage and having two children, now adults. AG \u00b6 20(b) recites \n\u201cdivorce\u201d as a condition \u201clargely beyond\u201d an applicant\u2019s control. That is the condition \nApplicant has confronted. The first element of that mitigating condition is, therefore, \nsatisfied. \nThe second element of AG \u00b6 20(b) is that an applicant act \u201cresponsibly\u201d under the \nadverse circumstances he faced. Applicant\u2019s divorce was sufficiently acrimonious that he \nwas unable to retrieve his naturalization certificate from the marital home, where his ex-\nwife now resides. And his divorce lawyer counseled that Applicant not contact his ex-wife \nabout the mortgage, because the divorce was so contentious. The only responsible option \nleft to Applicant was to allow the home to go through foreclosure, a process the record \nshows was occurring in March of this year. I find that SOR \u00b6 1.a has been mitigated under \nAG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe other five SOR debts total $2,071. The magnitude of that amount does not \nraise national security concerns. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

He is married and has a four year old son. He has a \ntenth grade high school education.

The following year, however, \ndue to COVID and its quarantine requirements, there was a drastic decline in business \nand Applicant could not keep up with financial responsibilities. In 2021, Applicant was \nforced to close the business. He then started looking for a job. At this point, however, \nhe had spent most of his savings simply trying to survive. He was forced to neglect \nsome bills and pay others in order to keep his family afloat. His mortgage and his car \npayment were his top priorities to ensure his family would have a place to live and \ntransportation. Other bills became delinquent. Applicant began working for his current \nemployer in October 2021. Since then, he has been slowly recovering, trying to pay off \nhis delinquent debts. He stated that he started by paying his smaller debts first, which \nincluded debts he owed to Lowes, Best Buy, and Home Depot. Applicant\u2019s wife is \nunemployed. \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR were of security concern: \n1.a., is a delinquent debt owed to a creditor that was charged off in approximate \namount of $26,963. This was a credit card that Applicant used to help finance his \nbusiness, and to help pay for living expenses after closing his business. \n(Tr. p. 48.) \nApplicant has set up a payment agreement with the creditor. The debt will be paid off in \nregular monthly installments of $250. Applicant began his first payment of $250 on \nMarch 30, 2023, that will continue monthly until the debt is paid in full.

(Tr. p. 57-58.) A letter from the creditor dated March 28, 2023, \nindicates that debt has been settled. The debt is no longer owing. (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit A.) \nApplicant stated that he was able to settle each of his debts by using his savings. \nAfter taxes, he brings home about $1,900 weekly. (Tr. p. 43.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDue to the pandemic, which caused the downturn in his business, Applicant \nbecame excessively indebted and could not afford to pay his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control primarily caused Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial indebtedness. Since obtaining full-time stable employment in October 2021, \nhe has directed his efforts at resolving his delinquent debt. He has successfully settled \nfive of his six debts and has set up a payment plan with the creditor to resolve the \nlargest and remaining debt. He has already started the regular monthly payments \ntowards resolving this remaining debt and plans to continue making these monthly \npayments until the debt is resolved. Ideally, Applicant should have contacted these \ncreditors before his security clearance became an issue. \nHowever, under the \ncircumstances, Applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner. He has \nshown good judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. There are clear indications that \nhis financial indebtedness is being resolved and is under control. \nApplicant has \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and has demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides full mitigation. \nThe Financial \nConsiderations concern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nshown maturity and responsibility. He has resolved each of his delinquent debts. He \nunderstands the importance of living within his means and paying his bills in a timely \nfashion. He also understands the responsibilities involved in possessing a security \nclearance. \nApplicant has shown the requisite good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness required of this privilege. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Items 3, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $56,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). These delinquencies consist of car \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e), unpaid rental obligations (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a cable debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), unpaid tuition (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The car loans \ncomprise about $53,000 of the $56,000 total SOR indebtedness. He admitted the SOR \nallegations with additional comments. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. \nThe SOR allegations are established through his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. The SOR debts became delinquent between 2018 and 2021. (Items 3-7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s March 2023 response to the SOR, he claimed that he satisfied the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d., and 1.f. on unspecified dates. He claimed he is making \npayments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He further claimed that the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a is \n\u201cclosed,\u201d and that he will attempt to make payment arrangements on the car loan in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. He failed to provide any documentary corroboration that he contacted the \nlenders, set up any payment plans for his SOR debts, or paid any of the accounts. \nContrary to department counsel\u2019s assertion that Item 4 provides proof that there is no \nbalance on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, I find that Item does not support her \nstatement. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so more recent information about \nhis finances is not available. Given the lack of corroborating evidence, I find that the \nSOR debts remain unresolved. (Items 3-7) \nApplicant became delinquent on the SOR debts because he borrowed more \nmoney than he could afford to repay. While he did not explicitly offer his divorces as a \nbasis for his financial issues, they presumably played a role. He claimed that he earns \nenough income each month to pay his financial obligations. The evidence shows that he \nhas resolved other delinquent accounts in the past, but it also shows that he is behind \non four debts that were not included in the SOR. He provided no evidence that he has \nundergone financial counseling.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has six delinquent debts totaling about $56,000, many of which are \nseveral years old. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are recent and ongoing. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he has resolved or is resolving his SOR debts. It is reasonable \nto expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts, but \nhe has not. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He has \nadditional debts that he is behind on that were not listed in the SOR. He has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by overspending and his divorces also \nlikely had an impact. His overspending was not beyond his control.

He failed to provide sufficient evidence that any of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Items 4, 6, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $32,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). These delinquencies consist of credit \ncards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d), a vehicle loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and a medical bill (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e).

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.e with additional comment. Despite his denials, those SOR allegations are \nestablished through the Government\u2019s credit reports. (SOR; Items 3-10) \nThe delinquent credit cards in the amounts of $12,505 and $8,216, alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, respectively, have not been resolved. Applicant opened the credit \ncard in SOR \u00b6 1.a in 2004 and last made a payment on it in November 2017. He \nopened the credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.c in April 2015 and last made a payment on it in \nNovember 2019. (Items 3-10) \nThe delinquent vehicle loan in the amount of $10,545 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b has \nnot been resolved. Applicant opened this account in April 2014 when he financed the \npurchase of a vehicle. The last payment he made on this account was in January 2019. \n(Items 3-10) \nApplicant disputed owing the credit card in the amount of $879 listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. He agreed that he opened the credit card but denied making charges on it. He \nclaimed the credit card should not have a balance and believes that someone made \ncharges to this credit card without his authorization. He disputed the balance with the \ncredit reporting agencies, but he acknowledged that the dispute has not been resolved. \nThe Government\u2019s 2021, 2022, and 2023 credit reports reflect that he has disputed this \naccount, but all three credit reports list it as an account in collection. Applicant provided \nno documentation to substantiate the basis of his dispute, nor has he provided \ndocumentation to show any resolution of his dispute. (Items 3-10) \nApplicant denied owing the medical debt for $170 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. because \nhe claimed that he does not recognize it and therefore does not know if he is \nresponsible for it. The debt was established in January 2022. He provided no evidence \nof any attempted resolution of this debt. He provided no documentation to substantiate \nthe basis of any dispute. The debt appears on the Government\u2019s 2022 credit report but \nnot on the Government\u2019s 2023 credit report. (Items 3, 9) \nApplicant has two additional delinquent debts that are not listed on the SOR. One \ndebt is a rental delinquency for $2,026 that is in collection.

(ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Item 10) \nApplicant claimed that the reason he became delinquent on the debts listed in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c is because his wife had a difficult pregnancy and health \nproblems that kept her from working. Her inability to work resulted in decreased income \nthat did not allow them to cover their expenses. In June 2022, he claimed that he would \narrange to pay these SOR debts in the future when his wife\u2019s health problems subside, \nand she is able to earn money again. He did not provide a timeline for when he thought \nhe might start paying these debts. He provided no evidence how he plans to resolve the \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. In June 2022, he provided a personal financial \nstatement showing that he has about a $500 monthly surplus. Therefore, he had at least \nsome available finances to address his SOR debts if he chose to do so. He provided a \npaystub from his employer for the May 14, 2022 through May 27, 2022 pay period \nshowing that he earned a net income of about $2,312. (Items 3-7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had five delinquent debts totaling about $32,000. Many of those debts \nhave been delinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. The SOR \ndebts remain unresolved, and he has not provided a timeline for when he will resolve \nthem. He also has two additional financial delinquencies not listed in the SOR. I cannot \nfind that his financial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his wife\u2019s health problems. These \nconditions were beyond his control. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must also show that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these debts. He has not \nresolved any of the SOR debts. While he disputed the balance on the debt listed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, he provided no documentation showing the result of that dispute. It is reasonable \nto expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Given these considerations, he \nhas failed to show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances and AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. The lack of evidence of the resolution of his SOR debts also makes AG \n\u00b6 20(d) inapplicable. \nApplicant disputed the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d because he believed he \ndid not have a balance on the account. This concern is a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt. He disputed the balance with the credit reporting \nagencies, which is reflected in the credit reports. However, the debt is still listed on the \ncredit reports, and he did not provide evidence of any resolution of the dispute.

ISCR Case No. 20-03691 at 3 (App. \nBd. March 29, 2023). For this same reason, Applicant\u2019s claim that he does not \nrecognize the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, without further evidence of resolution, is also \ninsufficient. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nNone of the Guideline F mitigating factors are fully applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On October 5, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on a November 7, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

Applicant admits each of the allegations with explanations. Credit reports of the \nApplicant dated May 2, 2020; February 24, 2022; and December 14, 2022, confirm that \nhe is indebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, \nand 6.) \nApplicant was married from 2015 to 2020. At some point, he and his wife \nseparated, and then divorced. Divorced proceedings which went on for an extended \nperiod, followed by a child custody battle. This was costly. His attorney fees and \nrelated costs totaled about $8,000. \nApplicant used credit cards to pay for living \nexpenses and household items, such as furniture, and appliances. Applicant ultimately \nobtained custody of his three children. (Tr. p. 20.) \nApplicant had stable full-time employment from 2012 to 2018. (Tr. p. 20.) He \nwas unemployed from September 2018 to early January 2019, and July 2019 to \nSeptember 2019, for a total of about six or seven months. (Tr. pp. 19-20.) He stated \nthat he had to borrow money from his mother to help with his living expenses. He \nexplained that was barely able to keep the expense of the house, the children, and their \nchildcare going. He could not afford to pay his debts, and he stopped making payments \non his credit card debt in 2018 or early 2019. He had no expendable money. (Tr. p. \n29.) Since 2018 or early 2019, no payments have been made towards the credit card \ndebt listed in the SOR. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in June 2020. He understood \nat the time that his job may require a security clearance. He was hired as a Machinist, \nand was recently promoted to be an Inspector.

He has a \n401(k) with about $7,000 and a pension that is not effective until he retires. (Tr. pp. 33 \nand 34.) \nApplicant initially testified that he was in the process of filing Bankruptcy to \ndischarge the debts listed in the SOR. However, he was advised by his Bankruptcy \nattorney to wait until after the hearing to determine if it is necessary, since all of his \ndelinquent debts will fall off of his credit report in 2025, because they are so old. (Tr. \npp. 22 and 34.) This will allow the Applicant to quickly rebuild his credit standing and \npossibly be able to purchase a house. Since September 2020, when he gained full-time \nemployment, Applicant has not made any payments towards resolving his delinquent \ndebts, nor has he contacted his creditors to set up payment arrangements. \nThe following delinquent credit card debts are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $10,460 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 29.) \n1.b.

(Tr. p. 29.) \nApplicant testified that he also learned that if he contacts the creditor to set up a \npayment plan, the creditor can then legally come after him for payment through the \ncourt system. Since he has had no contact with the creditors for four years, at this \npoint, the Statute of Limitation has run, and the debts are over four years old, Applicant \nunderstands that the creditor has no recourse against him for payment. (Tr. p. 25-26.) \nApplicant further testified that in 2021, during his security clearance background \ninvestigation, the DoD investigator told him that he should file for Bankruptcy because it \nwould look better to the Government to have the debt gone than to have it sitting \ndelinquent on his credit report. \nApplicant stated that he chose not to follow his \nsuggestion because it would extend his period of bad credit and take longer for him to \nrebuild it.  (Tr. pp. 39 \u2013 40.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of excessive financial indebtedness and has not \naddressed his delinquent debts. His actions or inactions both demonstrated a history of \nnot addressing his debt and/or an inability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has incurred excessive delinquent debt, admittedly, partially caused by \nhis separation, divorce, child custody battle, and short periods of unemployment. \nHowever, despite these unfortunate past events, since September 2019, he has been \ngainfully employed on a full-time basis, and he has not addressed any of his delinquent \ndebt. Four years have passed and apparently, Applicant plans to wait until 2025 when \nhis delinquent debts fall off his credit report to avoid paying his debts or even \naddressing them in any manner. This does not demonstrate that he is responsible. \nInstead, it shows his lack of responsibility. \nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and \ninaction for so long casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Applicant had not taken the necessary steps to show that he can properly \nresolve his financial delinquencies. He has avoided contacting the creditors or setting \nup regular systematic payments. This shows poor judgment and unreliability. None of \nthe mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is no evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have \nbeen resolved. Overall, Applicant has made no progress towards resolving his debts. \nHe still owes about $60,000 to his creditors that he obviously has no intention of paying. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his \nburden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant has failed to \nshow financial responsibility and is not found to be sufficiently reliable to properly \nprotect and access classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.t:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

It was his first time applying for a security clearance and he made \nmistakes on the security clearance application. He had a difficult time completing the \napplication and no one was very helpful while he was completing it. He actually began \nusing marijuana in 2019.

He also mentioned that he intended to use \nmedical marijuana in the future. (Gov 2 at 7) \nApplicant believed that there was no security issue with using medical marijuana. \nHe did not understand that although his marijuana use was legal under state law, it \nremained illegal under federal law. He was not made aware of this until his family \nmembers, (especially his grandfather) told him that marijuana use remained an issue \nwhen applying for a security clearance. He now understands that marijuana remains \nillegal under federal law. He stopped using marijuana about a month before his medical \nmarijuana card expired (July 2022) because he felt he did not need it anymore. He did \nnot reapply for a medical marijuana card when it expired in August 2022. He now deals \nwith his anxiety by running and fishing. He does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He submitted a statement indicating he will abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. He acknowledged any future involvement or misuse may result in \nthe revocation of his security clearance.

B. has been Applicant\u2019s step-grandmother since 2019. She has known \nhim since 2017. She is aware Applicant used marijuana and had a medical card. She \nthought it was a poor decision on his part and marijuana use had no place when \nworking for a defense contractor. In the summer 2022, he assured her that he had \nstopped using marijuana. She has observed a change in his judgment, clarity, and \npresence since that time. She has talked with Applicant about his future and he is \ncommitted to following rules and regulations. \nApplicant occasionally takes his younger siblings on outings and drives them to \nafter school activities.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance \nadjudications. It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the \nindividual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. \nRelevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and \nwhether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, \nincluding by signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national \nsecurity workforce employees that they should refrain from any future \nmarijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse;  \nAG \u00b625(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and  \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse.  \nApplicant admits he started using marijuana in 2019. He admits he applied for \nand received a medical marijuana card which was initially granted in 2020. (His recently \nexpired medical marijuana card was granted on August 22, 2021.) While Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use was legal under the state law where he resides, it remained illegal under \nfederal law. Applicant indicated he intended to continue using medical marijuana in \nresponse to section 23 on his March 2022 security clearance application and to an \ninvestigator who interviewed him on March 28, 2022, during his security clearance \nbackground investigation. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant used \nand possessed marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c) apply. The Government also \nestablished a prima facie case that Applicant expressed an intent to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. AG \u00b6 25(g) applies. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant stopped using marijuana around July \n2022, approximately one month before his medical marijuana card expired. \nHe \nsincerely believed that there was no issue with him using medical marijuana. He was \nnot aware that marijuana use remained illegal under federal law. Once he was told by \nfamily members, his grandfather in particular, that marijuana use remains illegal under \nfederal law and remains a security concern, he stopped using marijuana. More than 16 \nmonths have passed since he stopped using marijuana. He is focused on building a \nsuccessful career. While initially, he could have used better judgment, once he learned \nthat marijuana remained illegal under federal law he stopped using marijuana. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because Applicant acknowledged his illegal drug use and \nsigned a statement of intent indicating he will not use marijuana in the future. He \nacknowledged any future illegal use could result in the revocation of his security \nclearance. Once he learned that medical marijuana use remained illegal under federal \nlaw, he stopped using it and did not renew his medical marijuana card. He has not used \nmarijuana since July 2022. He no longer intends to use marijuana. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character references and his years of \nfavorable employment with his employer. I considered his honesty during the security \nclearance process. He admitted he used medical marijuana on his security clearance \napplication and during his background investigation interview. Once he discovered that \nmarijuana use remained illegal under federal law, he stopped using marijuana and has \nabstained from marijuana use for over 16 months. I find Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns under Guideline H. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns under Drug \nInvolvement are mitigated. Applicant has learned a valuable lesson. He is also aware \nthat any future illegal marijuana use may result in the revocation of his security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

FS1 filed the first complaint; FS2 filed the second complaint; and \nFS3 filed the third complaint. At the time these complaints were made Applicant and all \nthree of the female sailors were attached to the same Navy ship. FS1 obtained a \nmilitary protection order (MPO) against Applicant in April 2019, and FS2 obtained an \nMPO against Applicant a few days later. FS1 accused Applicant of watching her in the \nfemale berthing area taking a shower in March 2019. FS1 reported this incident a week \nafter it allegedly took place. All three female sailors accused Applicant of unwanted \nsexual touching such as groping their buttocks from June 2018 to March 2019 and \nreported the violations in April 2019. (Tr. 32-33, 57-72, 84; GE 2) \nIn May 2019, Naval Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) interviewed Applicant, \nand he voluntarily provided his cell phone to be examined. During this interview, he was \ninformed of the allegations against him and who made the allegations. After reporting \nthese incidents, FS1 and FS2 were transferred from the ship, but FS3 chose to remain \non the ship with Applicant. (Tr. 33-34; GE 2) \nIn December 2019, the ship\u2019s legal officer notified Applicant he was being \nawarded NJP, Article 15, UCMJ. The legal officer informed Applicant that the ship\u2019s \nimmediate superior in the chain of command\u2019s opined there was not enough evidence to \nwarrant a court-martial and recommended that the matter be dealt with at the command \nlevel, i.e. NJP. (Tr. 35; GE 2) \nApplicant was charged with the following offenses under the UCMJ: (1) Article \n92, failure to obey a lawful order; (2) Article 107, false official statement; (3) Article 128, \nassault consummated by a battery; and (4) Article 134, indecent conduct. (GE 2; SOR \nAnswer; Tr. 73-76) Applicant explained that he was charged with Article 107 because \nhis statement did not align with the accusations made against him.

Applicant \nexplained how the AirDrop was accidental. He was unable to call witnesses in support \nof his case because they were no longer on the ship or because of short notice were \nunable to provide supporting statements. His CO found him guilty of all charges and \nspecifications and awarded him: (1) to be reduced from pay grade E-6 to E-5; (2) to \nforfeit one-half month\u2019s pay per month for two months (suspended for 45 days); (3) to \nbe restricted for 45 days (suspended for 45 days); and (4) to perform 45 days extra duty \n(suspended for 45 days).

(SOR Answer) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nSexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the security concern about sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 provides the following conditions could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d). Further review is \nrequired. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

The specific charges, specifications, and findings of the \nNJP and administrative board are discussed, supra. The Article 107 NJP charges were \nnot considered at Applicant\u2019s administration board. The board did not find that Applicant \ncommitted any of the charges and specifications that arose from April 2019 complaints \nfiled by FS1, FS2, and FS3. They did, however, find that Applicant committed two of the \nArticle 92 offenses that occurred approximately one and a half years before the April \n2019 complaints, which he admitted and were handled at the command level. The \nboard found that (1) he made comments of a sexual nature creating hostile work \nenvironment: 3-0 supports allegation; and (2) sexual harassment, sending lewd photo: \n3-0 supports allegation. \nApplicant was not afforded the same level of due process at his NJP as he was \nat his administrative board. At his board, he had counsel and had the opportunity to \nsubmit evidence in a setting in which the evidence was reviewed by three independent \nboard members. The record does not contain any of the NJP proceedings but does \ninclude relevant administrative board proceedings. The Article 92 charges which the \nboard found were substantiated are of limited security significance given they occurred \nwell before the more serious April 2019 complaints. \nAs noted, supra, the administrative separation board did not find by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Applicant committed any of the offenses generated \nby the three complainants in April 2019. Stated differently, the board found that \nApplicant refuted the evidence of the of the three complainants that he engaged in any \nof the disreputable conduct of which he was accused. The basis for the administrative \nseparation board\u2019s conclusion was: (1) NJP admission of guilt (of the offenses that \noccurred before the April 2019 complaints; (2) NCIS interviews; and (3) text messages. \nThe record does not contain any evidence of the deliberative process that BUPERS \nconsidered in not accepting the administrative board\u2019s findings and recommendation. \nThe new evidence I received at Applicant\u2019s hearing were six character letters \nsubmitted by female Navy personnel familiar with him in a supervisory capacity and \nseveral were familiar with the offenses and complainants. I also received his \nperformance evaluations and heard his testimony, which I considered to be credible. \nAny new evidence received after the administrative board separation hearing supported \nthe finding that he did not commit the offenses for which he was found guilty of at NJP. I \ndid not have access to any of Applicant\u2019s records pertaining to his NJP proceedings, his \nNJP appeal, his command\u2019s forwarding endorsement of his administrative discharge \nproceedings, or of any BUPERS correspondence pertaining to their decision to \ndisregard the findings and recommendation of the administration board. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn evaluating and contrasting the Applicant\u2019s NJP versus his administrative board \nproceedings, a number of concerns came to light during his hearing: (1) Applicant\u2019s \ncommand arranged for an airline ticket two days before his NJP was adjudicated \ntransferring him off the ship; (2) FS1, FS2, and FS3 did not report the alleged unwanted \nsexual touching they claim occurred between June 2018 to March 2019 until April 2020; \n(3) none of the complaining witness appeared at Applicant\u2019s NJP; (4) given the short \nnotice Applicant was given for his NJP, he was unable to call any witnesses or obtain \nwitness statements; (5) Applicant testified that FS3 recanted her complaint; (6) \nApplicant produced credible alibis that rebutted the times and dates when the alleged \nassaults and shower viewing occurred; (7) a female witness familiar with the \ncomplainants came forward stating that FS1 and FS2 had to \u201cchange their stories so it \nwould make sense\u201d after Applicant  produced his alibis. She added that FS1 and FS2 \nfabricated their stories to get off the ship, and succeeded in doing so; (8) Applicant and \nhis counsel were not notified that his NJP appeal was denied until shortly before his \nadministrative board convened; (9) During Applicant\u2019s administration board, FS1 denied \nthat Applicant came into the female shower, which is contrary to her previous statement; \nand (10) BUPERS chose to discharge Applicant despite the administrative board\u2019s \nfindings and recommendation that he be retained. \nAG \u00b6 14 lists the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nI independently find that Appellant credibly denied the allegations of sexual \nmisconduct which were not substantiated at his separation board. The Article 92 \nallegations that Applicant admitted to, and the board found against him occurred \nseparate and apart from the more serious April 2019 allegations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) \nfully apply to his comments of a sexual nature creating hostile work environment and \nsexual harassment by sending a lewd photo. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b). Further review is \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor reasons discussed supra, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 32(c), and 32(d) fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances.

My comments \nunder Guidelines D and J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old electronics technician seeking a Secret security \nclearance. He successfully held a clearance during his ten years plus in the Navy. Until \nhis NJP and administrative board, his Navy career was on an upward trajectory. This is \namply documented by his performance evaluations and character letters. His former \nsupervisors and shipmates emphasized his attributes of patriotism, morality, and \njudgment especially with regard to safeguarding classified and sensitive information. \nApplicant has continued his post-Navy career in support of the national defense. He is \nmarried to a Navy petty officer and has two minor children. \nApplicant\u2019s command had no choice but to investigate and pursue diligently the \nreported allegations of sexual misconduct by three complainants. His command \nultimately awarded him NJP based on the information they had and the guidance they \nreceived. As noted, refusing NJP and demanding a court-martial is not an option \navailable to servicemembers attached to or embarked on a vessel. The NJP did not go \nwell for Applicant, and he was found guilty of all charges and specifications. Flight \narrangements had been made two days before his NJP to transfer him off his ship \nimmediately following NJP. After arriving at the shore command where his ship was \nhomeported, the shore command convened an administrative separation board to \nprocess him for separation. Being represented by counsel and having greater due \nprocess, Applicant fared substantially better at his board. \nFor reasons unknown, \nBUPERS overruled the board\u2019s findings and \nrecommendation and discharged Applicant with a general discharge under honorable \nconditions.

He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge in his Answer. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 8, 2022. The case was \nassigned to me on November 18, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on November 28, 2022. The case was heard on \nJanuary 18, 2023. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two additional witnesses, \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through F, which were also admitted without objection. \nThe record remained open for the receipt of additional documentation. The Government \noffered Government Exhibit 4 on January 19, 2023, which was admitted without objection. \nApplicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits G through L on February 3, 2023, which \nwere all admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nJanuary 27, 2023. The record closed on February 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 41 years old and married with two children. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree.

(Tr. 35-36; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Applicant \nExhibit A.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he abuses intoxicants to excess. He denied both allegations in this paragraph \nwith explanations. \nApplicant has worked consistently as a software engineer since graduating from \ncollege in 2006.

By early 2019 he was \nhaving serious emotional problems due to job and home stress, and the impact of his \nincreased alcohol and marijuana use. This description of his use is attested to by both \nApplicant and his wife.

While worthwhile, he did not feel that he \nhad received sufficient treatment to resolve his issues. Accordingly, he received an \nadditional 60 days of outpatient treatment. He feels that the treatment was successful. \n(Tr. 16-18, 22. 28-30, 37, 61, 73-74; Applicant Exhibit D.) \nSoon after returning to Company B after his three-month leave of absence \nApplicant received a job offer from Company A. As stated, he began working there in \nearly 2020. He testified that he enjoys the work and finds it very fulfilling. His evaluations \nat this job have been outstanding, according to his current and former supervisors. (Tr. \n75-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2, 6.) \nThe programs Applicant attended recommended that he not drink alcohol. He did \nnot drink alcohol for several months after finishing his program. He eventually began to \ndrink again and continued to drink some amount of alcohol several times a week until \nNovember 2022. At that point he made the decision to stop drinking altogether and began \nattending a recovery program. He testified that the program is assisting him in his \nrecovery. (Tr. 18-19, 42-46, 62, 68-70; Applicant Exhibits J and K.) \nApplicant continues to experience stress, even in the new job. He began seeing a \npsychiatric nurse practitioner (PNP) in January 2022 due to depression and anxiety. In \nMay 2022 the therapist reported, \u201cPatient [Applicant] states that he stayed sober for \nseveral days, but then would binge drink on a bottle of whiskey or pack of beer at a sitting. \nPatient continues to report cravings for alcohol.\u201d (Tr. 63-65; Government Exhibit 4 at 4; \nApplicant Exhibit I at 2.) \nApplicant Exhibit I has additional treatment notes from September 2022 at page 2. \nThe PNP stated: \nPatient [Applicant] remained on Pristiq, no longer taking naltrexone. States \nthat it worked well at first, then it seemed to stop working for etoh [alcohol] \ncravings. Has had some nights where he drank more than he desired, but \nnot getting overly intoxicated. Feeling much better with mood, denies any \ndown days like he used to have. [Reports] working full time, busy with \nfamily. Some anxiety with life stress \u2013 able to tolerate. \nApplicant testified that he does not feel he currently has a problem with alcohol. \nHe further testified that he never told the therapist that he engaged in binge drinking. He \nadmitted drinking a fifth of whiskey within three days. He did make an arrangement with \nhis wife that she would tell him if she felt that he was drinking too much. She did tell him \nseveral times about excessive drinking last year up to about August 2022. (Tr. 23-26, 44-\n45, 47-48, 66-68, 70-71.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received an evaluation from a DoD psychological consultant (Dr. One). \nHis report is dated July 6, 2022, and is Government Exhibit 3. (Tr. 46-47.) That report\nstated the following: \n \nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The Subject [Applicant] was referred for \nevaluation to determine if he meets criteria for any condition which would \njeopardize his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. Specifically, his \nhistory of marijuana and alcohol use was of concern. Based upon the \nincreased frequency and amount used prior to his voluntary admission to \ntreatment, the Subject likely met criteria for an alcohol use disorder and a \ncannabis use disorder. He currently does not appear to meet criteria for the \nmarijuana use disorder since his reported abstinence during the application \nprocess for his current position in early 2020. However, according to his \ncurrent medical records, Subject continues to suffer from alcohol cravings \nand engages in binge drinking to cope with work stress despite his stated \ndesire to be sober. Personal restraint has not appeared to be sufficient to \ncurb his consumption behaviors and he was most recently prescribed \nNaltroxone to mitigate cravings. As such, it appears that the diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder is still current and applicable to the Subject\u2019s profile. \nThe diagnoses below attempt to capture the Subject\u2019s present level of \nfunctioning. \nDIAGNOSIS: \nAlcohol use disorder, moderate \n(F10.20) \nUnspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress \n(F32.9) \nCannabis use disorder, moderate, in sustained remission \n(F12.20) \nPROGNOSIS: The Subject\u2019s prior history of alcohol and marijuana use and \nsubsequent treatment raised concerns over the Subject\u2019s ability to have \ngood judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Having an active diagnosis \nof either would bring inherent risk to those factors. The evaluation did not \nreveal that the Subject is suffering from any ongoing marijuana use. If his \nreporting of abstinence is accurate, then it is not likely a risk factor and can \nbe dismissed as a matter of consideration. However, the information from \nhis current prescriber indicated that he still struggles with binge drinking, \ncravings, and has difficulty staying sober. His consumption appears to be \nfor similar reasons now as it was when he submitted himself for voluntary \ntreatment (ie. [sic] work reviews). This information indicates that the \nSubject\u2019s alcohol use disorder is current, without a sustained period of \nabstinence, and therefore represents an inherent risk to his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was also evaluated by a psychologist (Dr. Two), who was retained by \nApplicant. (Tr. 48-49.) He submitted a report dated December 5, 2022. (Applicant Exhibit \nE.) That report stated: \nConclusion: \n[Applicant] has enjoyed mild to moderate drinking of beer and whiskey for \nmuch of his adult life. It became a problem for him three years ago, when \nhis drinking increased, and combined with cannabis use, sleep deprivation \n(due to his youngest child having sleep problems and requiring care at \nnight) and stress at work, he developed a mood disorder for which he \nsought and received successful treatment. It is unlikely that this mood \ndisorder (Substance Induced Mood Disorder) will reoccur. He sleeps well, \nhis child is doing well, he no longer smokes marijuana, and his work \nsituation has dramatically improved. \nTreatment three years ago was successful. He has learned to maintain \nregular mild to moderate use of alcohol. He currently drinks mildly, between \none and three times a week, on or two drinks on each occasion. To have a \ndiagnosed alcohol condition, a person must meet at last two of eleven \ncriteria over the last twelve months. The only sign that [Applicant] shows \nare occasional cravings, his drinking has never affected any important life \nfunctions, and he has never developed tolerance or suffered withdrawal \nsymptoms. Mild to moderate alcohol consumption, without any other \nchallenges, is not an alcohol problem and does not cause other difficulties. \nDr. Two submitted an Addendum dated January 20, 2023. (Applicant Exhibit G.) \nIt states: \nI would like to clarify that I reviewed that entire record, including notes from \n[PNP] [Applicant Exhibit I). In February 2022, she noted that alcohol use \nwas not affecting any significant life function. In May 2022, she noted \nincreased alcohol use, that again did not affect work or any other important \nlife functions. This does not qualify as a disorder. At this time, she also used \nthe term binge drink, which is incorrect, as [Applicant] emphatically states \nthat this was incorrect, that he would not drink an entire bottle in one sitting, \nbut over the course of several days. In September 2022, she also reported \nsome alcohol use, again not affecting work, relationships or any other \nimportant life skill. Throughout her record, she reports that medication \nhelped him maintain his mood. I stand by my impression that he has never \nqualified as having an alcohol disorder based on the DSM 5 definition. \nThough he drinks sometimes to excess, this is at home, not at work, does \nnot affect his relationships, work or any other life function, he is not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \ndependent, has never developed withdrawal symptoms, has never missed \nwork due to alcohol use, does not currently experience cravings. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible \nfor access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair \nhis judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. He denied SOR 2.a. He admitted in part and \ndenied in part SOR 2.b. He denied SOR 2.c. \nSOR paragraph 2.a. references Applicant\u2019s receiving mental health treatment as \npart of the factual statement. Paragraph 27 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which \nsets forth the concern under this guideline, states in pertinent part, \u201cNo negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.\u201d In addition, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nfactsheet, \u201cMental Health and Security Clearances,\u201d states in part, \u201cSeeking mental health \nservices does not affect one\u2019s ability to gain or hold security eligibility. Adjudicators regard \nseeking necessary mental health treatment as a positive step in the security clearance \nprocess.\u201d (Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Mental Health and Security \nClearances, https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/ pv/DODCAF/resources/DCSA-\nFactSheet Mental-Health SecurityClearances-Oct21.pdf \n(accessed \nSeptember \n5, \n2023.) \n2.a. There is little to no support for the allegation that Applicant has been \ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder. The only evidence is an affirmative statement by him in \nanswer to Section 21 \u201cPsychological and Emotional Health\u201d on Government Exhibit 1 that \nasked whether he had \u201cEVER been diagnosed by a physician . . . with . . . bipolar mood \ndisorder.\u201d He stated that he answered the question this way because of a statement made \nto him by one of his therapists during his first 30-day outpatient treatment that some of \nhis conduct could indicate a bipolar disorder. However, there is no diagnosis of bipolar \ndisorder found anywhere in the available medical records. He testified that both Dr. One \nand Dr. Two stated they did not believe Applicant suffered from a bipolar disorder. \n(Government Exhibit 1; Tr. 20, 49-52.) \n2.b. Applicant admitted, and the available medical records confirm, that he suffers \nfrom depression and anxiety. He is receiving therapy for it, and is also on medication.

The Government alleged that Doctor One\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant as currently \nsuffering from Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate, is cognizable under this guideline as well. \nApplicant denied this allegation. \nMitigation \nApplicant has been a successful employee at Company A. His current supervisor \ntestified and supplied a letter on his behalf. He has known Applicant since 2015 at \nCompany A and Company B, and has been his supervisor at both companies for more \nthan three years. He described Applicant as a \u201cgreat\u201d employee. He further testified that \nhe has not seen any evidence of alcohol or mental health issues with Applicant. He further \nstated that he has entrusted Applicant with large projects and stated he trusts Applicant \nnot to reveal classified or proprietary data. (Tr. 77-88; Applicant Exhibit F at 6.) \nAnother supervisor of Applicant\u2019s at both Company A and Company B submitted \na very laudatory letter on his behalf. He described Applicant as having \u201cthe highest \nintegrity.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit F at 1-2.) \nPeer feedback from fellow employees of Company A in 2022 was extremely \nfavorable. (Tr. 56-59; Applicant Exhibit B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol use, including binge drinking, which \ncontinued through November 2022. He was diagnosed by a DoD mental health consultant \nwith Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate in July 2022. He received treatment for a mood \ndisorder in 2019, which included a recommendation that he not consume alcohol. All three \nof the cited disqualifying conditions apply, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nNone of these mitigating conditions was sufficiently established by the evidence in \nthis case. Applicant has had a problem with alcohol for several years. He took a three-\nmonth leave of absence from his job in 2019 to obtain mental health treatment for stress, \nwhich included excessive alcohol use. He admitted that he still uses alcohol as a means \nto self-medicate during times of stress or depression through late 2022. I have considered \nall the medical records contained in this case and have incorporated them in my findings. \nInsufficient time has passed since Applicant stopped drinking. A finding on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf cannot be made at this point in time. Guideline G is found against Applicant. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions may be applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nWith regard to Guideline I, no adverse inference has been drawn because of \nApplicant\u2019s obtaining mental health treatment or his hospitalizations. Specifically, AG \u00b6 \n28(c) is not applicable to this case. \nAs stated above, there is no direct evidence that Applicant has ever been \ndiagnosed with a bipolar disorder. Accordingly, based on the available record, SOR 2.a \nis found for Applicant. \nTurning to the other two allegations. The record shows that Applicant has been \nsuffering from chronic depression and stress for years. In addition, he was diagnosed by \na DoD mental health consultant as having a current diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder, \nModerate. AG \u00b6 28(a) applies to this case. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn 2022 a DoD mental health consultant found that Applicant had a condition that \nmay impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nThe Government has met its burden under the Directive to establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Four of them have possible application to this case: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nSOR 2.b. As stated, Applicant has been suffering with depression and stress for \nmany years. He is undergoing treatment and by all indications the depression is controlled \nwith therapy and medication. There is no indication of a current problem. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), \n(b), and (e) apply. This allegation is found for Applicant. \nSOR 2.c. My discussion under Guideline G applies to this particular allegation. AG \n\u00b6 29(b) minimally applies because Applicant has recently entered a recovery program. \nHowever, as stated above insufficient time has passed to make a finding that he has \nresolved his alcohol issues. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because there is not a current mental health finding that \nthe previous condition is under control or in remission and has a low possibility of \nrecurrence or exacerbation. I have considered the statements by both psychologists. I do \nnot find Doctor Two\u2019s analysis sufficient to overcome that of Doctor One under the \ncircumstances of this case. \nApplicant is highly commended for all he has done to improve his mental health \nover the years. However, the strictures of the Guidelines as written require more from \nApplicant in terms of consistency of treatment and a current and favorable prognosis that \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrebuts the current report by the Government\u2019s mental health consultant. Given the current \nstate of the record I cannot find that Applicant has sufficiently mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by the evidence in this case. Guideline I is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has made strides in \nresolving his mental health issues, and related alcohol issues. However, the present \nrecord evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

The \nmarijuana use allegations were also cross-alleged under Guideline E. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2a-2.c) \nApplicant testified that he experimented with marijuana while in high school. In \n2015, he was hired by a defense contractor located in another state (State A). He and \nhis family moved to State A to take the job. At the time of his move, State A had \nlegalized the use of marijuana and the purchase of marijuana from state-licensed \ndispensaries. Sometime in 2015, he completed an SCA (this document was not put into \nevidence) with the assistance of his facility security officer (FSO). He described this \nprocess as him being on the telephone with his FSO, answering the FSO\u2019s questions \nfrom the SCA, and the FSO taking those answers and inputting them into the SCA \nonline computer program. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions about whether he used \nany illegal substances. He did this because he believed his use of marijuana in 2015 \nwas not illegal because it was allowed under State A\u2019s law. He was unaware that use, \npossession, and purchasing of marijuana was in violation of federal law. He does not \nrecall receiving any information from his employer or FSO that marijuana use was \nprohibited by federal law. (Nothing about falsifying his 2015 SCA was alleged in the \nSOR, so I will not use that information for disqualifying purposes. However, I may \nconsider it for credibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-person factors). (Tr. 20-\n23; SOR answer; AE A, p. 6) \nApplicant admitted that he used, purchased, and possessed marijuana in the \nform of gummies in approximately 2015 and perhaps into 2016. He used the marijuana-\ngummies between 50-100 times during that timeframe. He did it to relax. It also helped \nwith his migraine headaches.

Armed with this knowledge, he approached his program manager and told \nhim about his marijuana use and his mistaken belief about the law. His program \nmanager told him to stop using marijuana, but otherwise not to worry about it. Applicant \nhas not used, purchased, or possessed marijuana since told to stop doing so in \napproximately August 2016. While he worked in a cleared environment, he never \nhandled classified information during this time period. (Tr. 23-25, 40; SOR answer; AE \nA, p.6) \nIn March 2022, Applicant was selected by his employer to apply for a top secret \nclearance. This required him to complete a new SCA, which he did on March 25, 2022. \nDuring the process of completing his SCA, he contemplated the drug-related questions: \n\u201cIn the last seven years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances? and \u201cHave you ever illegally used . . . a controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance . . . .\u201d He answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. Before \ncompleting his answers, he testified that he sought guidance from his FSO about how to \nanswer the questions because he was not sure if his last marijuana use was within the \nseven-year timeframe. Applicant did not address the difference in the nature of the \nquestions. The first asking if he used within the last seven years and the second asking \nif he ever used. His FSO told him to \u201cdo his best\u201d in completing the SCA and address \nany questions he had in the follow-up interview with an investigator. He also asked his \nsenior colleagues about how he should answer the questions and they agreed with the \nFSO that he should address any questions or ambiguities during his follow-up interview. \nApplicant denied that he intentionally provided false information on his SCA. (Tr. 25-27, \n37; GE 1; AE A, p. 6) \nIn May 2022, Applicant was interviewed as part of his background investigation. \nThe written summary of this investigation appears at GE 2. Applicant disputed some of \nthe characterizations made by the interviewer and noted them in an email to \nDepartment Counsel (AE A, pp. 3-4) in August 2023. Applicant admitted using \nmarijuana in the last seven years to the investigator without first being confronted with \nknowledge of his prior use. He further explained the circumstances of his use and his \nignorance of federal law prohibiting use of marijuana until his enlightenment in \napproximately August 2016. Appellant disagrees with the investigator\u2019s characterization \nthat Applicant said he did not know why he did not list his marijuana use on his SCA. He \nmaintains that he told the investigator about his confusion concerning the seven-year \nwindow to report drug use and he was not sure whether his situation required reporting. \nHe decided to wait to ask clarifying questions when he spoke to the investigator, which \nhe did. Overall, I found Applicant\u2019s testimony and explanations credible. (Tr. 26, 37-38; \nGE 2; SOR answer; AE A, pp. 3-4) \nApplicant submitted a letter from a friend who has rented a room from him for \napproximately 10 years. The friend stated that he has not witnessed Applicant use \nmarijuana since 2016. Applicant also submitted a written statement of intent not to use \nmarijuana or THC products in the future, that such use could result in the revocation of \nhis clearance, and that marijuana use is illegal under federal law. Applicant\u2019s wife does \nnot use marijuana or THC products.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana from 2015 to sometime in 2016. Although he held a \nsecurity clearance at the time, there is no evidence that he had access to classified \ninformation. The evidence is to the contrary based on his testimony that he did not \nhandle classified information, which went unrebutted by the Government. I find that AG \n\u00b6 25(a) applies to both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, however, without the \u201cwhile granted access \nto classified information\u201d language established here, those two allegations become \nduplicitous. I find in favor on Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred approximately seven years ago. He \ncredibly testified that he immediately stopped using marijuana upon learning it was \nillegal under federal law. There is no evidence of more recent use. He acknowledged \nhis drug use and took action to change his behavior by ceasing all use of marijuana. He \nalso provided a signed statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and 26(b) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nI also note in accordance with the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s clarifying \nguidance letter concerning marijuana dated December 21, 2021, I have considered that \nthe evidence here supports mitigation in the form of Applicant\u2019s abstinence since 2016 \nand his signed letter of intent of nonuse in the future. The guidance also states that \nviolation of federal drug law remains relevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of \nsecurity clearance eligibility. (See ES 2021-01529) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . .; \nApplicant did not list his 2015-2016 marijuana use on his 2022 SCA. He credibly \nstated that his intent was not to deceive the government about his past drug activity. \nRather, he was legitimately confused about his reporting responsibilities because of the \nambiguity that existed in his mind about whether his last use was within the past seven \nyears. While this does not apply to the \u201cever used\u201d question of SOR \u00b6 2.b, his response \nto both of these questions was confused by the guidance he sought from his FSO and \nother senior colleague as to how to answer them. He was advised to address any \nambiguities he had about the questions with his background investigator, which he did. \nThus, I find that while he deliberately answered both questions incorrectly, he did so \nwithout an intent to deceive, but with an intent to clarify the answers with the \ninvestigator. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is sufficient under Guideline H, as noted above. AG \n\u00b6 16(c) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 2.c. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, before his reporting of \nit, was a source of vulnerability to exploitation and could affect his professional standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly explained that he was confused about his reporting \nresponsibility when he was completing his 2022 SCA. He was advised by both his FSO \nand his senior colleagues to address any questions or ambiguities with his background \ninvestigator during his upcoming interview. He did so by telling the investigator all the \ncircumstances of his prior marijuana use and his confusion over the applicability of \nfederal law and the seven-year reporting window. He was not confronted by the \ninvestigator about his prior drug use before he reported it in response to a general \nquestion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b. \nApplicant admitted his past marijuana use and credibly testified about his nearly \nseven years of abstinence. He immediately ceased using marijuana when he was made \naware of its illegality under federal law. He provided a written statement of intent not to \nuse in the future. I conclude that any future drug use is unlikely to occur. AG \u00b6 17(d) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 2.c \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E. Those factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under \nthose guidelines. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the drug involvement and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 2.a \u2013 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

GX 3 through GX 11 are admitted without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 44 years old, married and has two adult children. From October 2002 \nthrough June 2004, he attended college and earned an associate degree. He has lived \nat his current residence since 2005. He started with his current employer in April 2008 \nand is a technician. (GX 3, 10-11) \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent federal student loans totaling $44,672 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.o) and one delinquent medical account totaling $469 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). Applicant \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o and denied SOR \u00b6 1.p with explanations. In addition to \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the debts are established by Applicant\u2019s April 2017, March 2021 \nand June 2022 credit reports. (GX 1-2, 6-8) \nApplicant explained that he took out student loans to fund his college education \nfrom 2002 through 2004. The loans came out of deferment in late 2004, but he could \nnot afford to make the minimum payment of $900 each month. He stated that from late \n2004 through early 2017, he made no payment on his student loans. (GX 2-4, 10-11) \nApplicant stated that, during this time, he made multiple attempts to complete a \nrepayment plan through the Department of Education (DOE) website. On each \noccasion, the website calculated a monthly repayment that was 2.5 times greater than \nhis mortgage. He stated he then called DOE on three separate occasions and \nrequested that a repayment application be mailed to him. However, he claimed he never \nreceived the paperwork. He did not provide further detail as to the proposed payment \nplans, what dates he contacted DOE or what additional efforts he undertook to resolve \nthese delinquent accounts prior to 2017. (GX 2-4, 10-11) \nIn May 2017, DOE issued a wage garnishment order to Applicant\u2019s employer and \nlisted the amount due as $71,861. Applicant\u2019s April 2017 credit report reflected a \ndelinquent student loan balance of about $57,319. The record is unclear as to the \nreasons for the balance difference. At the time, Applicant\u2019s annual salary was about \n$53,000, paid bi-weekly. The involuntary wage garnishment was calculated at $211 per \npay period, beginning in June 2017. (GX 4, 9) \nOnce the garnishment was initiated, Applicant took no action to establish a \npayment plan with DOE or otherwise bring his loans into good standing. He stated he \nchose to allow the garnishment to continue as a way to repay the debt and not cause \nfinancial burden to his family since it was a payment he could afford.

A comparison of Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflects that \nhis delinquent student loan balance decreased from $57,319 to $44,672 during this \ntime. (GX 2, 8-9, 11) \nIn about March 2020, the wage garnishment was suspended as part of \nCOVID-19 relief efforts. Applicant\u2019s April 2022 earnings statement does not show \npayments toward the garnishment. In his May 2022 Response to Interrogatories, \nApplicant stated that the garnishment remained suspended and he had not issued any \nother payment on his student loans. He anticipated that the garnishment would renew \nonce the COVID-19 relief efforts terminated. (GX 2, 4) \nIn his October 2022 Answer to the SOR, Applicant did not specify whether any \nadditional payments had occurred on the student loans since the garnishment was \nsuspended and he did not provide any detailed history of payments. However, he \nrestated that he will allow the garnishment to proceed in order to repay the debt in a \nway that does not cause a financial burden. (GX 2) \nWith regard to the delinquent medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.p), Applicant did not \ndisclose the debt in his February 2021 SCA or recognize it during his March 2021 \nsecurity clearance background interview. However, with his Answer, he provided a \nstatement from the collection agency showing that the debt had been paid in full shortly \nafter his interview. (GX 2) \nOutside of the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has no additional \ndelinquent debts. An April 2022 earnings statement shows that he had an annual salary \nof about $75,000. In May 2022, he submitted a budget that confirmed his salary and \nreflected that, after paying his monthly obligations, he maintained a net remainder of \nabout $1,800 per month. That budget did not include any payment toward his student \nloans. (GX 4, 8) \nApplicant stated that his intent was to take care of all of his financial issues \nresponsibility. He further stated that he was able to live within his means and described \nhis financial situation as \u201cgreat.\u201d (GX 2, 11) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to \nAG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nThe adjudicative guideline notes three conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that, from late 2004 through \nearly 2017, he issued no payments toward his delinquent student loans. He described \nan inability to pay on his student loans in 2004 because of financial difficulties. \nHowever, even after securing his current employment in 2008, he continued to take no \nsubstantive action to bring his student loans into good standing. Evidence reflects that \nthe student loans remain in collection status with involuntarily payments only occurring \nafter the issuance of a wage garnishment order in 2017. He also has an additional \naccount in collection status. All of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. \nThere are three pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans came out of deferment in late 2004. He claimed he did \nnot initially pay on his student loans because he could not afford the payment. While it is \npossible that he struggled financially while initially entering the workforce, he did not \nexplain how those possible struggles prevented him from making any payments on his \nloans over the next thirteen years. Instead, outside of a few unspecified efforts to \nestablish a payment plan, he took no action on his student loans until forced to do so by \nthe wage garnishment order in 2017. \nFollowing the 2017 garnishment, Applicant took no action to bring his student \nloans into good standing. About three years later, following the COVID-19 suspension of \nthe garnishment, he again took no action to further address his student loans. Instead, \nhe is content to allow the garnishment to eventually resume. \nIt is noted that, since the garnishment was initiated in 2017, Applicant\u2019s balance \non the loans has decreased by about $12,650. However, when considering the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, even when delinquent debts are being paid, the \nadministrative judge must evaluate the totality of the evidence and consider the \ncircumstances of the underlying debts for what they may reveal about an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 3 (App. Bd. July 5, 2017) \nSatisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor's garnishment \nis not the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor. ISCR \nCase No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Court-ordered or otherwise \ninvoluntary means of debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less weight \nthan means initiated and carried through by the debtor himself. ISCR Case No. 17-\n04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019) Similarly, the fact that an applicant\u2019s student loans \nare in a deferment status does not excuse an applicant\u2019s past inactions in the context of \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021) \nNone of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are fully applicable to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.o. Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal student loans are long-standing, ongoing, \nand cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. It took \nApplicant nearly thirteen years to begin issuing payments on his delinquent student \nloans, and he only did so through an involuntary garnishment. While the balance of the \ndelinquent student loan debt has reduced through payments under the garnishment, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthose payments alone do not establish good-faith effort, especially when compared to \nthe years of inaction that occurred before and since the garnishment was ordered. The \nCOVID-19 suspension of the garnishment was a condition beyond his control. However, \nboth before and after the suspension, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), and 20(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.p. Applicant learned of this \ndelinquent medical account during his security clearance background interview. That \nsame month he took action to resolve the debt through payment. \nThrough garnishment, Applicant\u2019s student loan debt has decreased. However, \nthe debt reduction alone does not fully mitigate the ongoing financial security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nFor nearly twenty years, the only documented action taken to resolve Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent student loans has been the DOE issuance of a wage garnishment order in \n2017. Although his student loan balance has decreased through involuntary \ngarnishment payments, Applicant\u2019s actions, to date, are insufficient to establish good-\nfaith, responsible efforts to resolve his delinquent federal loan debt.

On June 14, \n2023, the case was assigned to me. On July 18, 2023, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for August 17, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled using a \nvideo-teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 - 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered 11 exhibits \nwhich were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - K, without objection. The record was \nheld open until August 31, 2023, to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. He timely \nsubmitted two documents which were admitted as AE L - M, without objection.

Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nProcedural Issue \nDuring the hearing, the Government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2.a pursuant to \nDirective paragraph E3.1.17, as follows: \nb. You are indebted to the Federal government for unpaid taxes for tax year \n2017 in the approximate amount of $3,637.02. As of the date of the \nStatement of Reasons, the taxes remain unpaid.  \nThe amendment was approved without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and admitted \nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional \nfindings follow. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to maintain a \nsecurity clearance. He has held a security clearance since 2006. He started at his current \nemployer in July 2023. He worked for several other contractors prior to his current \nposition.

(SOR \u00b6 1.b: \nGov 2 at 13-14) Applicant disclosed on his SCA, dated October 28, 2020, that he had not \nfiled federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. (Gov \n1, Section 26, at 73-74) On December 29, 2021, he provided additional information about \nthe status of his federal and state tax returns in response to DOHA Interrogatories. In his \nresponse he indicated he had not filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2016 \u2013 \n2020, because he was waiting for his federal tax returns to be completed. He did not want \nto create a financial hardship by owing both at the same time. He also provided copies of \nfederal tax transcripts for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  (Gov 2)  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant claims that he filed his taxes through tax \nyear 2021. He said the IRS has a severe back log. The last update he received from the \nIRS was that tax years 2016 - 2018 were processed. They are working on the 2019 taxes \nand cannot process later years until it is complete. Applicant states the tax debt incurred \nin 2017 should be resolved once the refunds from unprocessed tax returns are applied to \nthe debt. If he still owes taxes after the income tax returns are processed, he will be able \nto pay the balance. (Answer to SOR) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted to being aware that federal income tax \nreturns were required to be filed by April 15th  of each year. He states he stopped filing his \nfederal and state income tax returns in 2016 because he was going through a difficult \nperiod during his separation from his spouse. He did not handle things responsibly. His \nfailure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns created a bigger problem. He \nhad difficulty finding his W-2s. (Tr. 25-26)  \nApplicant started to file his late income tax returns on his own in 2020, after he\nsubmitted his SCA. Some of the returns were accepted. Some were not. The IRS found\nissues with the 2019 federal income tax return so he had to amend his return. In February\n2023, he hired a tax professional to help with amending his 2017 and 2019 federal and\nstate income tax returns. He believes once his amended 2017 federal income tax return\nis processed, the balance of taxes owed for 2017 will be completely resolved or\nsignificantly reduced. Applicant owed $8,121.02 in unpaid taxes for tax year 2017.\nRefunds from tax years 2018, 2020, and 2021 were applied to the 2017 tax debt. The\ncurrent balance owed for the 2017 tax debt is $3,637.02 (Tr. 20-21, 36-38; AE H; AE I)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn June 23, 2023, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS for \nthe 2017 federal tax debt.

He will pay it off \nsooner when the refund from his 2019 tax return is applied to the 2017 federal tax debt. \n(Tr. 26-31, AE J) Once his amended 2017 federal income tax return is processed and \naccepted, he believes he will receive a refund of $4,011. \nThe current status of the federal and state income tax returns and any balances \nowed are as follows: \n2016 Federal and State Income Tax Returns: Applicant filed his 2016 federal \nincome tax return on June 14, 2021.

Ms. H has known Applicant for \nthe past 31 years. She attests to Applicant\u2019s honest and upstanding character. He has \nalways been there to support her during difficult moments. She is a single mother and \nApplicant has provided a positive role model for her three children. He has donated his \ntime to take part in her church\u2019s activities such as helping with food drives and delivering \nmeals to the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ms. H personally witnessed the toll \nthe dissolution of his 14-year marriage/relationship took on him. Applicant struggled to \nget back on his feet emotionally. She states Applicant is not one to cheat, evade or scam \nthe system.  He has a high level of integrity. (AE M at 2-3)  \nMr. B. has known Applicant for several years. He notes Applicant\u2019s financial \nbackground has helped their annual community project every fall. Between September \nand December, their group sponsors over 125 families who are in the foster care system. \nIn December, they provide gifts and a holiday party for children in foster care. Applicant \nuses his financial analyst skills to formulate a budget every year. Applicant contributes to \nthe success of the project and has refused to accept any payment for his contributions. \nHe also tutors children between the ages of 4 and 7 on reading and spelling.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2016 \u2013 2020. He owes approximately $3,637 in federal income taxes for tax year 2017. \nAG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant admits he stopped filing his federal and state income tax returns in 2016 \nbecause he had a difficult time dealing with his marital separation. This is considered a \ncircumstance beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. However, it is given less \nweight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nHe neglected to timely file and pay his federal and state income taxes for more than four \nyears. He was aware he was required to file them on an annual basis, but neglected to \ndo so. It is noted that while he filed federal income tax returns for tax years 2021 and \n2022, both returns were filed late. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s federal income returns for tax years \n2016 through 2020. He filed his federal income tax returns in 2021. They were late, but \nthey were filed. The IRS contacted him about issues with his 2019 federal income tax \nreturn in December 2021. He had not resolved these issues at the date of the hearing. \nAfter the hearing, he consulted a professional tax preparer who helped him prepare \namended returns for 2017 and 2019. Applicant entered into a repayment plan related to \nhis 2017 federal tax debt. He made his first payment on August 1, 2023. The 2017 tax \ndebt has been reduced by applying his federal tax refunds for tax years 2018, 2020, and \n2021 to the debt. Applicant is confident the debt will be resolved once the refund for tax \nyear 2019 is applied to the balance owed for the 2017 tax year. \nApplicant did not provide documentary proof that his state income tax returns were \nfiled for tax years 2016 and 2018. The record was held open to allow him to contact the \nstate comptroller\u2019s office to acquire documentation about the status of his state income \ntax returns for the years in question. Applicant claims the state would only provide status \nabout his state income tax returns verbally over the phone. He claims they said the only \nyear that was outstanding was tax year 2017. He recently amended this return and is \nexpected to receive a refund. Absent corroborating documentary evidence, this is not \nsufficient for me to conclude that all the state income tax returns have been filed. \nApplicant receives some credit for finally filing his federal and state tax returns \n(with the exception of his 2016 and 2018 state income tax returns), however, any credit \nis minimized by his extended delay in filing those returns. The DOHA Appeal Board has \nheld that failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this case, Applicant did not file his late federal and state income tax returns until \nafter he submitted his SCA. He did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns raised by his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by his friends.

He has sufficient financial resources to pay his debts, \nincluding his taxes. The only area of concern under financial considerations is his history \nof failing to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through \n2020. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated\u201d). \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a \nsecurity clearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the \nFederal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d). \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the favorable decision of the administrative judge in a case where the applicant \nfiled his 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax returns in February 2014 and his 2012 tax return in \nAugust 2015 all before the SOR was issued. The applicant in that case owed less than \n$1,800 in federal income taxes for those four tax years at the time of the decision. Id. The \nAppeal Board found the timing of the filing of his tax returns to be an important factor \nstating: \nApplicant did not resolve his tax filing delinquencies until after submission \nof his security clearance application and after undergoing his background \ninterview. Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id. \nat 5. \nApplicant may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of the \nrequirement to timely file his federal and state income tax returns in the context of his \neligibility for access to classified information. His actions under the Appeal Board \njurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

On November 7, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline H.

(Tr. 42-43) She \nstopped using marijuana before she was hired by a DOD contractor in 2001. (Tr. 43) She \nwas tested for illegal drug use before she was hired. (Tr. 44) The DOD contractor\u2019s policy \nwas employees were not allowed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs at work. \n(Tr. 43) She was never drug tested after the DOD contractor employed her. (Tr. 44) She \ndid not use illegal drugs from 2001 to 2012. (Tr. 45) \nIn 2012, Applicant applied for a security clearance because her employer believed \nshe might need it in the future. (Tr. 31) She said she did not use marijuana in the previous \nseven years on her 2012 SCA. (Tr. 34) In 2012, she did not have access to classified \ninformation. (Tr. 31) About two months after her security clearance was approved, she \nwas transferred to a different state, and she did not need a security clearance. (Tr. 32) \nShe never used marijuana while having access to classified information. (Tr. 32) She \nunderstood that she was not permitted to use marijuana while she had a security \nclearance. (Tr. 34) She used marijuana a few times from 2012 to 2014, which was after \nshe completed her 2012 SCA. (Tr. 45) Although she did not have access to classified \ninformation, she used marijuana after her security clearance was granted. (Tr. 46) She \ndid not believe her employment while working for the DOD contractor was \u201csensitive\u201d \nemployment. (Tr. 52-53) Her annual pay in 2020 was about $135,000, and she supervised \nemployees working on some important DOD contracts involving weapons systems. (Tr. \n53) As to whether her employment is sensitive, she said it depends on how the term \n\u201csensitive\u201d is defined. (Tr. 54)   \nApplicant used marijuana two or three times between 2015 and July 2021. (Tr. 34, \n38, 51) However, later she said she did not use marijuana from January 2014 through \nOctober 2017. (Tr. 49; GE 1) She ended her association with the people with whom she \nused marijuana, except for her husband who continues to use marijuana. (Tr. 35-37) She \nhas used marijuana with him in the past. (Tr. 50) He does not use marijuana in her home \nor in her presence. (Tr. 37-38) She did not advise her facility security officer of her \nmarijuana use because she was not accessing classified information. (Tr. 48) \nApplicant stopped using marijuana in July 2021 because she was looking for new \nemployment, her daughter was getting older, and she had made some other life-style \nchanges. (Tr. 38) She has not received any medical treatment for abuse of illegal drugs. \n(Tr. 39; AE I) Her primary-care physician indicates she has not been prescribed any \ncontrolled substances; she has not received any inpatient mental-health treatment; and \nshe has been of \u201csound mental health.\u201d (Tr. 39; AE H) \nApplicant regrets her marijuana use, and she does not intend to use marijuana in \nthe future. (Tr. 40; AE I) She acknowledged her marijuana use was wrong, and she \napologized for her marijuana use. (Tr. 42) She provided a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for or would result in revocation of national security \neligibility. (AE I) See AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), infra. She offered to voluntarily submit to random \nurinalysis testing for detection of abuse of illegal drugs.

(Tr. 27; AE I) A director where Applicant is currently employed \ndescribed her as an exceptional leader who is extremely talented, loyal, ethical, diligent, \nand trustworthy. (Tr. 41; AE J) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d AG \u00b6 25(f) is not \nestablished because she did not actually have access to classified information, and there \nis insufficient evidence that she held a \u201csensitive position.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c). Additional discussion is in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c).

The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security .clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)); AE L. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana 10 or less times while working for a DOD \ncontractor. Her decision to repeatedly possess and use marijuana after being granted a \nsecurity clearance is an indication that she may lack the qualities expected of those with \naccess to national secrets. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. She voluntarily disclosed \nher marijuana possession and use during the security clearance process. She disclosed \nher marijuana use on her SCA, to an OPM investigator, in her SOR response, and during \nher hearing. She provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and she acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAt her hearing, Applicant said she ended her marijuana use in July 2021, and she \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future. Her husband continues to use marijuana \nalthough he does not use marijuana in her presence or in her home. I am not convinced \nher marijuana possession and use \u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur [and] does not cast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good \njudgment.\u201d I am uncertain about her future marijuana use. More time without marijuana \nuse is necessary to establish her future abstinence from marijuana possession and use. \nGuideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old senior manager. She has been employed since 2001 \nworking for two DOD contractors. She received four promotions from her first DOD \nemployer. In 2001, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems. \nShe was awarded master\u2019s degrees in business administration and information \nmanagement. Her resume provides additional information about her employment history \nand background. \nApplicant received excellent performance evaluations, which included \u201cexceeded \nexpectations\u201d in the areas of integrity and trust. Her ratings were all \u201cexceeded,\u201d \n\u201cimpactful,\u201d or \u201cexceptional.\u201d (AE B-AE F) Her employers since 2001 have never \ndisciplined her. A director where Applicant is currently employed described her as an \nexceptional leader who is extremely talented, loyal, ethical, diligent, and trustworthy. \nApplicant discussed his history of involvement with marijuana on her SCA, during \nher OPM personal subject interview, in her SOR response, and at her hearing. She did \nnot test positive on a urinalysis test, and she does not have any drug-related arrests. She \npromised not to use marijuana in the future. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nApplicant said she used marijuana 10 or less times after receiving a security clearance in \n2012; however, she did not actually have access to classified information. Her most \nrecent marijuana use was in July 2021, which was 22 months before her security \nclearance hearing in May 2023. She resides with her husband, who is a current marijuana \nuser. There is no \u201cbright line\u201d test on how long a person must abstain from marijuana \npossession and use to receive access to classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nAn honest and candid self-report of marijuana use is an important indication that, \nif granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to \nnational security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her \nown career or personal reputation. Applicant receives full credit for her candid and honest \nself-report of her marijuana possession and use during the security clearance process. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith continued abstention from illegal drug possession and use, she may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

(Answer) \nApplicant also included in his Answer two reference letters from character \nwitnesses who stated that he is a reliable, valued and trustworthy associate. In his \nFORM Response, Applicant summarized his professional achievements and \nresponsibilities as a team leader within his company. He cited his conduct, ethics and \ndedication to the DOD mission he was working. (AX A; FORM Response) \nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) \nJordan is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Abdullah II bin Hussein. The \nking has ultimate executive and legislative authority. The multiparty parliament consists \nof a popularly elected House of Representatives and a Senate appointed by the king. \nThe Public Security Directorate has responsibility for law enforcement and reports to the \nMinistry of Interior. The Public Security Directorate and the General Intelligence \nDirectorate share responsibility for maintaining internal security. The General \nIntelligence Directorate reports directly to the king. The armed forces have a support \nrole for internal security. Civilian authorities maintain effective control over the security \nforces. There were credible reports that members of the security forces committed \nsome abuses. \nThe State Department updated its Country Report on Terrorism for Jordan in \nFebruary 2023. The information is substantially similar to the prior report, included as \npart of AN I. I refer to the more recent report available as it reflects the most current \ninformation available. Jordan remained a committed partner on counterterrorism and \ncountering violent extremism. As a regional leader in the Defeat-ISIS Global Coalition, \nJordan played an important role in coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group\u2019s \nterritorial control and operational reach. Although Jordan did not experience a \nsuccessful terrorist attack in 2021, the country faced a continued threat from terrorist \ngroups. (See U.S. State Department, Country Reports on Terrorism 2021: \nhttps://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/ (February 27, 2023)) \nHowever, the U.S Department of State travel advisories for Jordan, last updated \nin October 2022, range from Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution) due to terrorism, to \nLevel 4 (Do Not Travel), depending on the area of the country visited. The capital of \nAmman is currently assessed as being a high-threat location for terrorism directed at or \naffecting official U.S. Government interests. Transnational and indigenous terrorist \ngroups have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. \nViolent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-\nSham (ISIS), and al-Qaida, directly or indirectly have conducted or supported attacks in \nJordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. Western interests and \n\u201csoft\u201d targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nschools and malls. Jordan's prominent role in the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS and its \nshared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. \nThe most recent State Department Human Rights Report for Jordan was issued \nin March 2023. Significant human rights issues in Jordan included credible reports of: \ntorture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment by \ngovernment authorities; arbitrary arrest and detention; political prisoners or detainees; \narbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and media, including harassment and intimidation of journalists, unjustified \narrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, and enforcement of and threat to \nenforce criminal libel laws; serious restrictions on internet freedom; substantial \ninterference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, \nincluding overly restrictive laws on the organization, funding, or operation of \nnongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations; inability of citizens to \nelect their executive branch of government or upper house of parliament; lack of \ninvestigation of and accountability for gender-based violence, including but not limited to \ndomestic or intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and other harmful practices; \nviolence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or \nintersex persons; and significant restrictions on workers\u2019 freedom of association, \nincluding threats against labor activists. The government took some steps to investigate, \nprosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses; however, \ngovernment impunity for such abuses remained widespread. (See U.S. State \nDepartment, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2022: Jordan: \nhttps://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/jordan/ \n(March 20, 2023)) \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DOD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, \nto a determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court noted in Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \nsecurity [and trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge's \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance [or trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the trustworthiness concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. It denotes a risk \ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \ngovernment or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with one or more family members living \nin Jordan is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an \napplicant has a close relationship with even one relative living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006). There is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nhas ties of affection for, or obligation to, their immediate family members. See ISCR 01\u00ad\n03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). \nApplicant\u2019s parents, one brother and two sisters are citizens and residents of \nJordan. The country\u2019s shared borders with Iraq and Syria and the presence of ISIS and \nal-Qaida reflects that Jordan remains a high-threat location for terrorism and establish a \n\u201cheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a) has been raised by the evidence. \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nUnderstandably, Applicant maintains regular and frequent contact with his \nparents and siblings who reside in Jordan (as well as his Jordanian brother in Saudi \nArabia). It cannot be said that his relationship with his immediate family members are \ncasual or infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to them. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2007. He obtained an advanced \neducation and has established his career in the United States. His wife is a U.S. citizen \nand both of his children are native-born U.S. citizens. He also has one brother and \nsister that are citizens and residents of the United States. These are all factors that \nweigh in Applicant's favor. \nHowever, his ties to Jordan are also strong. He maintains a very close \nrelationship with his parents and siblings in Jordan, communicating with them daily. He \nalso provides financial support to them when needed. Applicant failed to provide \nsufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that he will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the Unites States. Additionally, Applicant did not meet \nhis burden of demonstrating that he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a position \nof public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \nApplicant did not request a hearing and I did not have the opportunity to question \nhim further about his family connections to Jordan or to assess his credibility by \nobserving his demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nThe record reflects that Applicant came to the United States in 2007, became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2012, and has since worked and furthered his education. He has additionally \nmarried and raised two children in the United States. \nHowever, Applicant also maintains close and ongoing ties with his family in \nJordan. Although Jordan is a key U.S. ally in combating terrorism and extremist \nideology, it remains a high-threat location for terrorism. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \npublic trust position. Given Applicant\u2019s family connections to Jordan, I conclude that he \ndid not present sufficient evidence to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation. \nThis is not a comment as to Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States. It is merely a finding \nthat he did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline B. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a position of public trust. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k with explanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years old and married. In 2013, he enrolled in a technical program and earned his associate\u2019s degree in 2015. Unable to find employment in his field of expertise, he worked a variety of jobs including as a baggage handler, a car service agent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his bills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for his sick father.

On October \n27, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant received the \nFORM on November 17, 2022. He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did \nnot respond to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 21, 2023. The SOR and the Answer \n(Items 1, 2) are the pleadings in the case. The documents provided in the Answer as \nwell as Items 3 through 6 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k with explanation. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old and married. In 2013, he enrolled in a technical program \nand earned his associate\u2019s degree in 2015. Unable to find employment in his field of \nexpertise, he worked a variety of jobs including as a baggage handler, a car service \nagent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his \nbills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for \nhis sick father. In 2020, Applicant started working with his current employer in a \ntechnical field related to his degree. (Items 3, 6) \nApplicant did not list any delinquent debts in his October 2020 SCA. However, he \nvoluntarily disclosed his delinquent debts in detail during his January 2021 background \ninterview. (Items 3, 6) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($9,238), 1.b ($5,741), 1.c ($4,989), 1.d ($3,997), 1.e ($3,950), 1.f \n($3,487), 1.h ($951) and 1.i ($877) are all past-due federal student loans with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (DOE) that Applicant opened in 2013 and 2014. The debts \ntotal about $33,000. During his interview, Applicant stated he had not made any \npayments on the loans since 2015 or taken any subsequent steps to repay the debt. \nHowever, he intended on setting up a payment plan as soon as possible. (Items 4-6) \nIn his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, Applicant stated he was \nin the process of making payment arrangements on the student loans. He submitted a \ncopy of a March 2022 DOE Loan Rehabilitation application. There is no evidence that \nthe application was approved or that he submitted any payments in compliance with it. \nAn April 2022 credit report reflects that the loans are in collection status with the DOE \nas the creditor.

(Item 2) \nAs of this writing, the repayment of several federal student loans are in \nforbearance status due to the COVID-19 pandemic under multiple Presidential \nExecutive Orders since March 2020. Federal student loan payments remain paused \nuntil at least June 30, 2023. See (https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-\n19). \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,453) is a charged-off credit card account. During his interview, \nApplicant disclosed that this account became late in 2019 and that he intended to \nsatisfy it. In his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, he stated that \u201cfull \npayments have been made\u201d and that a payment confirmation was attached. In support, \nhe produced two documents confirming the settlement of a debt not alleged in the SOR. \nIn his Answer, Applicant included one of these documents and again claimed the debt \nhad been paid. However, neither the account name, number or other identifiable \ninformation from the document can be associated with this SOR debt. The debt is \nreflected as charged off in Applicant\u2019s April 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 4-6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($86) is a medical debt that was placed for collection. Applicant \nadmitted the debt and stated he would resolve it as soon as possible. However, there is \nno evidence of a payment or other resolution of this debt in the record. (Items 2, 4-6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($44,756) is a joint mortgage account that is past due with a total loan \nbalance of $378,803. Applicant\u2019s April 2022 credit report reflects that the mortgage was \nopened in May 2017 with a date of last activity of May 2020. Applicant admitted the debt \nand stated he was a \u201cco-signer to the house.\u201d He did not elaborate on when or why the \nloan became past due. He did not present any plan to bring the mortgage current or \nstate whether he intended on refinancing or selling the house. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant\u2019s March 2022 paystub showed that he earned, with overtime, take-\nhome pay of $2,999 every two weeks. He did not specify how often he earned overtime. \nA Personal Financial Statement shows he maintained a net monthly remainder of about \n$700. (Item 5) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe debts in the SOR, including multiple delinquent federal student loans, a past-\ndue mortgage account, and other delinquent debts, are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the credit report in the record. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant acknowledged in his background interview that he had not made any \npayments towards his student loans since 2015. The loans remained delinquent for \nyears prior to DOE\u2019s COVID moratorium on payments and Applicant\u2019s March 2022 Loan \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nRehabilitation application. A credit report continues to show the loans in collection \nstatus. Additionally, his mortgage account, charged-off credit card and a medical \naccount in collection remain delinquent and unresolved. His delinquencies are therefore \nongoing. He has not established that his debts are due to circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant experienced some financial stress in 2019 when he earned insufficient \nincome to cover his bills and took time off work to care for his sick father. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore has some application. However, Applicant has not shown he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. His only attempt to resolve his student loans \noccurred in March 2022; long after the loans became delinquent and did not include any \nsubsequent payments or payment plan. He provided no explanation for why his \nmortgage account remained significantly past due or a plan for resolving this debt. He \nfailed to provide evidence that the charged-off credit card and medical account in \ncollection are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant did not provide documentary or other corroborating evidence to show \nthat he issued payments or made other good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient documentary or \nother evidence to establish that the financial security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant did not request a hearing, nor did he respond to the FORM. In so \ndoing, he did not provide any additional evidence in explanation or mitigation beyond his \nAnswer. Following the completion of his associate\u2019s degree in 2015, Applicant did not \ntake any action in resolving his delinquent student loans until he submitted his DOE \nLoan Rehabilitation application in March 2022. \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s student loans, mortgage and additional accounts remain \ndelinquent, and he has not established any payments or shown other efforts towards \nresolving them. He has not established a reliable financial track record and has not met \nhis burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Applicant appealed. On May 16, 2023, the Appeal Board remanded \nthe decision. Several of the debts in this case concern Applicant\u2019s federal student loans \nthat arose from his attendance at ITT Technical Institute (ITT Tech). In its decision, the \nAppeal Board took administrative notice of a press release from the Department of \nEducation (DoE) dated August 16, 2022, concerning the discharge of ITT Tech student \nloan debt, and noted that they had done so in previous cases. (Appeal Board Decision \nat 2, citing ISCR Case N. 21-01688 (App. Bd.

(Appeal Board Decision at 2) \nOn May 23, 2023, as permitted by the Appeal Board, I reopened the record and \nallowed both parties to submit any additional exhibits or information. Applicant \nsubsequently submitted five emails with statements and attachments that I have \nidentified as AX A through E. The Government submitted additional argument but no \nadditional documents and did not object to Applicant\u2019s exhibits. \nI also notified the parties that I would take administrative notice (AN) of the DoE\u2019s \nAugust 2022 press release, as cited in the Appeal Board\u2019s decision.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old and married. In 2013, he enrolled in ITT Tech and \nearned his associate\u2019s degree in 2015. Unable to find employment in his field of \nexpertise, he worked a variety of jobs, including as a baggage handler, a car service \nagent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his \nbills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for \nhis sick father. In 2020, Applicant started working with his current employer in a \ntechnical field related to his degree. (Items 3, 6) \nApplicant did not list any delinquent debts in his October 2020 SCA.

The debts totaled \nabout $33,000. During his interview, Applicant stated he had not made any payments \non the loans since graduating in 2015 and he had not taken any subsequent steps to \nrepay the debt. However, he intended on setting up a payment plan as soon as \npossible. (Items 4-6) \nIn his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, Applicant included a \nDoE Loan Rehabilitation application, dated that same month, and stated he was in the \nprocess of making payment arrangements on the student loans. There is no evidence \nthat he submitted any payments under this plan. The most recent credit report in the \nrecord, from April 2022, reflects that the loans were in collection status with DoE as the \ncreditor. (Items 4, 5) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the delinquent student loans and stated \nthat a payment plan with DoE was pending. He did not include any evidence of \npayments. (Item 2) \nHowever, in August 2022, DoE issued a press release stating it was discharging \nall student loans relating to ITT Tech that originated from 2005 through 2016. In the \npress release, DoE recited the troubled history of ITT Tech, specifically noting that \nITT Tech had misled students about the quality of their programs for years in order to \nprofit from the federal student loan programs. This announcement followed a series of \nlawsuits, settlements and other remedial actions taken by DoE against ITT Tech. In \nJanuary 2023, Applicant received notice from DoE that his student loans were \ndischarged as part of these efforts. (AN I; AX A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,453) is a charged-off credit card account. During his interview, \nApplicant disclosed that this account became delinquent in 2019 and that he intended to \nsatisfy it. In his March 2022 Response to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, he stated that the \naccount had been paid and that a payment confirmation was attached. In support, he \nproduced two documents confirming the settlement of another credit card account in \ncollection that was not alleged in the SOR. In his Answer and in his subsequent \nsubmission, he included a copy of one of these documents and again claimed the debt \nhad been paid. However, neither the account name, number or other identifiable \ninformation from the document can be associated with this SOR debt. The debt is \nreflected as charged off in Applicant\u2019s April 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 4-6; AX B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($86) is a medical debt that was placed for collection. Applicant \nadmitted the debt and stated he would resolve it as soon as possible. Following the \nreopening of the record, he provided a document showing that, in March 2023, the \naccount was paid in full. (Items 2, 4-6; AX B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($44,756) is a joint mortgage account that was past due with a total \nloan balance of $378,803.

He did not \nelaborate on when or why the loan became past due or detail any plan to bring the \nmortgage current. (Items 2, 4-6) \nFollowing the reopening of the record, Applicant detailed that he had co-signed \nfor the mortgage, but did not own the home. He stated he was not aware that the loan \nwas delinquent until he received the SOR. He then claimed that the owner had, without \nhis knowledge, modified the mortgage and borrowed additional funds. Applicant stated \nhe was pursing court proceedings to force a sale of the property in order to be removed \nfrom the loan. (AX B) \nHowever, Applicant later produced correspondence from an attorney clarifying \nthat the mortgage had not been modified. Instead, the attorney speculated that the \nowner had likely added arrears to the loan balance and that there remained \napproximately $150,000 in equity should the house be sold. (AX C) \nApplicant did not provide any additional information regarding his efforts to be \nremoved from the loan. Instead, he produced a transaction history from the mortgage \nservicer, dated March 2023, that reflected the mortgage had been in various levels of \ndelinquency from early 2020 through the middle of 2022. However, a payment of about \n$45,000 was posted to the account in October 2022. This, and subsequent smaller \npayments, brought the mortgage current. (AX D) \nApplicant submitted a paystub and budget that showed he was maintaining full \ntime employment with a net monthly remainder of about $700. Applicant\u2019s employer \ndescribed him as maintaining a strong work ethic and receiving exemplary praise from \nthe various clients he served. (GX 5; AX E) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe history of delinquent debts reflected in the SOR, including multiple federal \nstudent loans, a past-due mortgage account, and other accounts in collection, are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the April 2022 credit report in the record. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) \nThe Appeal Board has also stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a \ndebt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. \n21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of \nevery debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the \nfinancial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no \nrequirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThere are four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant acquired sizeable student loans while studying at ITT Tech from 2013 \nthrough 2015. Although he did not discuss his experiences at that school, he struggled \nto obtain employment after earning a degree there. His income remained inconsistent \nthrough 2019 when he voluntarily took leave from work while caring for his father. He \nfinally began earning a consistent income in 2020 when he started with his current \nemployer. \nApplicant stated his intent to address his student loans during his background \ninvestigation and eventually submitted a DoE Loan Rehabilitation application in March \n2022. Before a payment plan was established, DoE fully discharged his loans. This \ncame after DoE determined that ITT Tech had, for years, misled students about the \nquality of their programs and engaged in predatory lending practices. \nAdditionally, in 2017, despite his own financial struggles, Applicant co-signed for \na mortgage but did not track the status of the account. On receipt of the SOR, he \nlearned that the mortgage was substantially delinquent. A month later, the first of \nseveral payments was issued to resolve the arrears. The account remains current. \nApplicant also resolved additional accounts not alleged in the SOR and recently \npaid his delinquent medical debt. While Applicant did not provide documentation to \nshow specific payment of the SOR 1.g debt, his overall efforts at debt reduction reflect \nthat he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAlthough Applicant could have documented his efforts to satisfy these debts \nearlier, he has established that he has no current financial problems. Moreover, the \nresolution of these accounts and his current financial situation reflect that his financial \nproblems were a temporary aberration. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the student \nloans because of the details provided within the DoE press release and evidence \nshowing that his student loans were discharged.

AG \u00b6 20(d) applies because he acted in good faith, albeit late, \nto address his debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) also applies because his debts occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant graduated from, the now discredited, ITT Tech in 2015. He struggled to \nfind employment in his field of expertise and maintain consistent income. In 2019, he \nalso spent a period away from work caring for his father. These events led to his \nfinancial delinquencies. \nApplicant secured his current employment in 2020. Shortly afterwards, he \nresolved some delinquent accounts. In 2022, he applied for rehabilitation of his student \nloans. Before he made any payments, DoE discharged the loans. Additionally, when he \nlearned that the mortgage account that he cosigned for was delinquent, he brought the \naccount current and provided documentation showing that payments are now being \nmade timely. He also provided a budget establishing his ability to maintain his accounts \ngoing forward. \nWith the additional information provided by Applicant, he has shown that his \nfinancial concerns are an anomaly.

She previously worked for the same federal \ncontractor from November 2019 until June 2021. She married in 2003 and divorced in \n2013. This is her first application for a security clearance. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nThe SOR alleges four debts totaling $63,562. The debts are comprised of a \npersonal loan and two credit cards owed to the same creditor and a $143 debt owed to a \ncable company. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the three debts owed to the \nsame creditor and denies the debt owed to the cable company stating that she has paid \nit. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s March 2022 credit-bureau report \n(CBR). (GX 5.) She also discussed her delinquent debts during her April 2022 personal \nsubject interview (PSI). (GX 4.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. \nFrom March 2007 until March 2012, Applicant was employed by a federal \ncontractor overseas. When she returned to the United States in 2012, her income \ndecreased significantly. Following her divorce in 2013, Applicant\u2019s minor children lived \nwith her and she was primarily responsible for all of their care. This created even greater \nfinancial strain. Applicant stated in her PSI that during the period between 2012 and 2019 \nshe struggled financially due to her decreased income, her increased financial \nresponsibilities, including medical bills for one of her children, who suffered from an \nillness. (GX 4.) \nIn 2011, while employed overseas, Applicant opened a personal credit-card \naccount. She routinely used this card and made on-time payments. After returning to the \nUnited States, Applicant began using her credit card for necessary living expenses. In \n2013, Applicant opened a second personal credit-card account with the same creditor \nthat she used in an effort to maintain her financial obligations in the wake of her divorce. \nIn 2014, Applicant obtained a personal loan through the same creditor. Because she \nrequired a vehicle to maintain employment and care for her children, she used the \nproceeds of this loan to pay off her vehicle loan as well as to maintain her other financial \nobligations. (GX 4; GX 5; GX 6; Answer.) \nBetween March 2012 and December 2017, Applicant was employed in low-paying \npositions outside of her professional field of expertise. By March 2016, she was no longer \nable to maintain the payments on her two credit-card accounts and on her personal loan. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant contacted the creditor and explained her circumstances, but was not in position \nto resolve the accounts, and defaulted on each of the accounts. These are the delinquent \naccounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. These accounts have been charged off. (GX \n3; GX 4; GX 5; GX 6.) \nDespite her efforts to find employment, the job market was difficult in the area \nwhere Applicant and her children resided. Applicant was unemployed from December \n2017 until August 2018. From August 2018 until November 2019, Applicant was \nemployed part time in a low-paying job. In November 2019, she gained employment with \na federal contractor in an overseas position in her field of expertise. She discontinued her \ncable service, paid her final bill, and returned the equipment to the company. The creditor \nof the $134 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is this cable company. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor and disputed the debt as indicated on GX 5. In her answer to the SOR in her \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant again stated that she had contacted this creditor. The \ndebt does not appear on her December 2022 CBR. This account has been resolved. \nBetween November 2019 and mid-2021, Applicant submitted an e-QIP several \ntimes. However, her federal-contractor employer terminated her in June 2021 without \nexplanation. After her termination, Applicant contacted the DOD Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) for information regarding the status of her security clearance \nprocessing. The DOD CAF contacted her employer, who stated that the reason for \nApplicant\u2019s termination was that there was an internal administrative issue that resulted \nin her e-QIP not being properly completed or submitted, that resulted in the \ndiscontinuation of their sponsorship. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nFollowing her termination, Applicant returned to the United States. She was \nunemployed from June 2021 until January 2022 when she regained employment with her \nprior federal contractor employer. She has returned to her overseas position. However, \nshe is experiencing the same difficulties as she previously experienced as she awaits \nresolution of her security clearance status. In an effort to maintain her employment, she \nhas been using her vacation leave, approved administrative leave, and has taken a leave \nof absence. (GX 3; Response.) \nDespite the financial difficulties that Applicant experienced between 2012 and \n2019, she has not had any additional delinquent accounts since 2013. Her children are \nnow adults and she is no longer financially responsible for them. Applicant understands \nthat she is responsible for repaying these accounts and considers resolving them a \npriority. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 4; Response.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues initially arose in 2012 when she returned to the United \nStates from overseas employment and experienced a significant decrease in income. \nBetween 2012 and 2019 Applicant was either underemployed or unemployed. She and \nher husband divorced in 2013 and Applicant had primary financial and custodial \nresponsibility for her two minor children, one of whom suffered from an illness. In an effort \nto make ends meet, Applicant used her two credit cards and the proceeds from her \npersonal loan in an effort to maintain her financial obligations for herself and for her \nchildren. She prioritized using a portion of the personal loan proceeds to pay off her \nvehicle loan. Ultimately, in 2016, she was no longer able to maintain the payments on her \ntwo credit cards and personal loan and she defaulted on them. These are the delinquent \naccounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a. through 1.c. \nHowever, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Between 2012 \nand 2019, she secured whatever employment was available to her. Despite her sustained \nperiod of underemployment or /unemployment, she did not incur any delinquent debt or \ndefault on any accounts after 2013. She contacted the creditor of SOR debts 1.a. through \n1.c and advised them of her financial situation prior to defaulting on the accounts. In 2019 \nshe accepted a lucrative position in her field of expertise working overseas for a federal \ncontractor. Since she was terminated from his position due to administrative error on the \nemployer\u2019s part, she has been rehired and is again working overseas in a lucrative \nposition. She remains committed to resolve these debts as soon as she is financially able. \nShe successfully disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, a small remainder from an old \ncable bill, and it no longer appears on her most recent credit-bureau report. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) While those granted access to classified information are \nheld to a high standard of conduct, they are not held to a standard of perfection. \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant\u2019s financial habits are \nreckless or irresponsible or that she is likely to disregard her financial obligations in the \nfuture. She accepts responsibility for her three remaining delinquent accounts and fully \nwill resolve them. She lives within her means and has not incurred any recent delinquent \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(e) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal-contractor employer\u2019s willingness to rehire Applicant indicates \nthat she previously conducted herself in a manner consistent with an individual warranting \na security clearance. Despite the significant financial challenges that she experienced \nbetween 2012 and 2019, including divorce, underemployment and unemployment, and \nthe illness of her child, Applicant did not incur any additional delinquent debt in the last \n10 years. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by her financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On\nSeptember 21, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF.

Her two youngest children reside with their father, her first \nhusband, to whom she was married from 2006 until they divorced in early 2015. She \nremarried in 2021.

She also resumed living with him again until \nDecember 2014, when he was incarcerated for committing an act of domestic violence \nagainst her. Due to the nature of their separation, she agreed to an uncontested divorce \nto expedite the process. Before finalizing their divorce, she and her first husband reached \na verbal agreement that he would be solely responsible for repaying the HELOC as he \nretained exclusive possession of their former marital home with their children. In her \nAnswer, Applicant stated, \u201cThere was a verbal, non contractual [sic] agreement with no \ndocumentation nor court order naming him the responsible party and relinquishing myself \nof the obligation,\u201d and \u201cThe verbal agreement was reached due to his ownership of the \nhome used as collateral to obtain the HELOC and my financial capabilities at the time.\u201d \n(Items 2, 4, 5, 6) \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s initial separation from her first husband, she was unable to \nprovide an ideal home for her children. In December 2012, upon the petitions filed by both \nfathers, the court awarded custody of the two youngest children to her first husband and \nthe eldest to her child\u2019s father. At that time, the court also ordered Applicant to pay child \nsupport of $343 per month to her first husband and $303 per month to her eldest child\u2019s \nfather. Her then annual gross income was $26,000. After deductions for child support and \nhealth insurance for the family, her net income was \u201cbarely above $600\u201d per month and \nrendered her \u201cincapable\u201d of repaying the HELOC. (Items 2, 5) \nOnce the divorce was finalized in early 2015, Applicant and her first husband no \nlonger communicated about finances. They did not discuss the HELOC again until 2017, \nwhen her first husband advised Applicant of his and their children\u2019s new home address \ndue to the short sale of their former marital home. At that time, he conveyed to her that \nhe expected the proceeds of the short sale to cover the then delinquent balance of the \nHELOC. It was not until October 2018, during an attempt to finance the purchase of a \nvehicle, that Applicant learned the HELOC remained in delinquent status. She \nimmediately contacted her first husband and he advised her that he would contact the \nlender to investigate why it was not satisfied through the short sale. In her Answer, she \nstated, \u201chis ownership of the home used as collateral [for the HELOC] as well as being \nthe primary applicant on the [HELOC] is why I continued to look to him for answers versus \ncontacting the lender myself. I understand this does not excuse me from taking \nresponsibility as the co-signer of this debt.\u201d (Item 2) \nIn her April 2022 SCA, Applicant reported that she resolved a $7,000 child support \ndebt. Beginning in December 2014, she fell behind in her child support payments, due to \nthe lack of a steady income. She maintained full-time work with the same employer in the \nhealth care industry from January 2008 until July 2014, when she left to work a more part-\ntime schedule so that she could be home more for her children. In August 2013, she \nobtained a second job working part time nights and weekends as a bartender and server \nin the restaurant industry. In August 2014, she transitioned her part-time position to full \ntime and continued to work nights and weekends.

In December 2017, both fathers of her children filed a petition \nin December 2017 to settle the $7,000 arrearage. Both fathers agreed to release \nApplicant from the $7,000 arrearage in exchange for Applicant\u2019s agreement to pay the full \namount of her child support obligation going forward. Applicant had been paying the full \namount from October 2017 through at least April 2022. Given the financial stability \nafforded by her then new full-time position with her current employer, she expected to be \nable to continue paying the full amount through her children\u2019s 18th birthdays. The child \nsupport debt was reported as \u201cclosed or paid,\u201d with a $0 balance in her April and August \n2022 credit bureau reports (CBRs). As this debt was not alleged in the SOR, it will be \nconsidered solely to evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. (Items 4, 5, 6) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s SI, she also addressed the two SOR debts as well as a resolved \nproperty tax debt. Attempting to rebuild her credit, Applicant opened a credit-card account \nin May 2019 with a $300 credit limit. At that time, she felt confident that she could afford \nto make the payments given her then two-income household. She used the card to pay \nfor clothing, food, and fuel. However, she fell behind in her payments in October 2019 \nbecause she could no longer afford them as her household was reduced to one income. \nNo information was available in the record concerning how she became a two-income \nhousehold or lost the second income. She defaulted on the card so that she could ensure \nhousing for herself and maintain a good payment record on her vehicle. During that time, \nshe took on a secondary job as a waitress to supplement her income. However, the \nsupplemental income was \u201csporadic and unreliable.\u201d In May 2020, the creditor charged \noff the debt, in the amount of $653 (including penalties and interest), to profit and loss in \nMarch 2020, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6) \nAlthough her April 2022 CBR listed the credit-card debt with a $0 balance, \nApplicant told the investigator that she intended to contact the creditor to settle the debt. \nIn her Answer, she explained that she had been working to accrue enough savings to \nmake monthly payments on the account. In a December 2022 FORM response, she \nexplained that her attempts to settle the account had been thwarted because it had been \ntransferred \u201cmultiple times.\u201d On March 10, 2023, the collection agency for the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b confirmed that it had been paid in full. In addition, although it was not alleged \nin the SOR, in January 2023, Applicant negotiated a payment with the same collection \nagency to repay a debt for a \u201cmuch older account\u201d with a balance of $567. She agreed to \npay $72 per month from January 2023 through December 2023 to resolve that debt. (AE \nA, C, E; Item 2, 4 5, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished for one week in October 2017 to repay an \nunpaid $400 personal property tax debt. The tax had been assessed on a vehicle that \nwas jointly titled in her name and an ex-boyfriend\u2019s name. When the ex-boyfriend moved \naway following their breakup, he took sole possession of the vehicle and verbally agreed \nto pay all expenses associated with the vehicle, including the property tax. Applicant was \nnot aware of the existence of the tax debt until her wages were garnished. Because this \ndebt was not alleged in the SOR, it will be considered solely to evaluate mitigation and \nthe whole person concept.

Sometime between \nthe completion of her SCA and the SI, she learned, for the first time, that her marital home \nhad been foreclosed upon (not sold via short sale). She also became aware that the \nHELOC remained in delinquent status. In her Answer, Applicant acknowledged her \nresponsibility for repaying the debt as a co-signer on the HELOC. She expected that she \nwould be able to repay the debt given the salary increase associated with her current \nemployment. She intended to reach out to the lender to negotiate a \u201cfinancially feasible\u201d \nrepayment agreement. She anticipated that she may have to file bankruptcy if she could \nnot arrange a payment arrangement that she could afford. (Item 2) \nIn her December 2022 FORM response, Applicant explained that she had been in \ncontact with the HELOC creditor. The creditor advised that there was a significant \ndiscrepancy between the balance owed on the HELOC according to their records and the \namount being reported on Applicant\u2019s credit report. The creditor advised Applicant that it \nwould be in her best interest to file a dispute with the credit bureau to resolve the issue. \nThe creditor also reviewed various repayment options. Applicant planned to begin \nrepaying the debt once the credit bureau resolved her dispute. In the meantime, she also \nconsulted with an attorney about filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Based upon the advice \nreceived, she and her current husband were exploring the option of filing for Chapter 13 \nto consolidate their debts to gain a lower monthly payment. On December 21, 2022, \nbased on its research of the account, the credit bureau resolved the dispute by deleting \nthe HELOC debt from Applicant\u2019s CBR. (AE A, B, D). \nNo new delinquent debts were reported on Applicant\u2019s August 2022 CBR. All \naccounts reported on Applicant\u2019s March 9, 2023 CBR were in good standing. She intends \nto maintain her credit going forward. In her Answer, she stated, \u201cThe fluctuation in my \ncredit score as well as the delinquency of these accounts has impacted my life \ntremendously and I have learned how important it is to uphold financial obligations as \nagreed to do so.\u201d She does not intend to make any future payments to the HELOC creditor \ndue to the successful resolution of her dispute with the credit bureau. (AE D; Item 2) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant successfully disputed the HELOC debt thereby resolving SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nShe paid the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b in full. She incurred the HELOC debt \nunder circumstances that were beyond her control and are not likely to recur. Her first \nhusband agreed to repay the HELOC debt as part of the terms of their divorce, which was \nreasonable given that he retained possession of the marital home and held the primary \nmortgage in his sole name. He failed to pay the HELOC as promised. He also failed to \nprovide Applicant notice of the home\u2019s foreclosure and the HELOC\u2019s default. Despite \nthese circumstances, Applicant acknowledged, that as a co-signer on the loan, she was \nresponsible for the HELOC debt and initiated efforts to resolve it with the creditor.

Considering the record as a whole and the resolution of both \nSOR debts, I conclude that her indebtedness is resolved, unlikely to recur, and no longer \ncasts doubt about her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \n20(d), and 20(e) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nthe debts alleged in the SOR.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since July 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1986 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2006. He attended college, but he has not earned a degree. He is married with two adult children. (Tr. at 11, 14-18, 37, 39; GE 1) The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $83,000.

(Tr. at 26, 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5) Applicant had a good income while working overseas from about 2009 to 2013. He did not make as much when he returned and relied on credit.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since July 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from \n1986 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2006. He attended college, but he \nhas not earned a degree. He is married with two adult children. (Tr. at 11, 14-18, 37, 39; \nGE 1) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $83,000. The debts are \nlisted on one or more credit reports from February 2022, November 2022, and March \n2023. (Tr. at 26, 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5) \nApplicant had a good income while working overseas from about 2009 to 2013. \nHe did not make as much when he returned and relied on credit. His balances \nincreased to the point where it was difficult to keep up. He contracted with a debt-\nsettlement company in June 2018 to assist him in resolving his debts. (Tr. at 11-16, 20, \n40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, B) \nApplicant enrolled ten debts, totaling about $100,000, in the company\u2019s debt-\nresolution program, including five of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant agreed to \nmake monthly $600 payments, which would be held in an escrow account, minus the \ncompany\u2019s fees. The debt-settlement company agreed to negotiate settlements with his \ncreditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow account to pay the settlements. \n(Tr. at 11-13; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A, B) \nApplicant made numerous payments in excess of the $600 monthly payments. \nHe also occasionally missed a payment. As of August 2023, he had deposited $44,096 \ninto the escrow account, and it had a balance of $4,084 available for settlement \npayments. Four debts totaling about $30,500 were not alleged in the SOR because they \nwere settled and paid before the SOR was issued. (Tr. at 13, 21-22, 25, 40, 44; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A, B) \nThe debt-settlement company reached an agreement with the credit union for the \ncharged-off $20,000 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c to settle the debt for $9,812. The credit \nunion charged off $20,817. The credit reports show declining balances and indicate the \naccount was being paid \u201cunder a partial payment agreement.\u201d By February 2022, the \nbalance had been reduced to $16,626. The balance was $13,900 in November 2022 \nand $12,810 in March 2023.

The credit reports show declining \nbalances. By February 2022, the balance had been reduced to $3,305, and the balance \nwas $1,925 in November 2022. The settlement payments were completed in December \n2022, which resolved this debt. (Tr. at 25-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE \nA, B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $1,117 delinquent debt to a collection company on behalf of \na bank. The debt-settlement company reached an agreement to settle the debt, which \nwas $1,445, for $723. The balance was $1,254 in February 2022, before the SOR was \nissued.

The debt is listed on the February 2022 credit report, but not the two later credit \nreports. (Tr. at 27-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5) \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($23,167) and 1.b ($22,222) are in the debt-\nresolution program but have not yet been paid. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a $7,581 charged-off \ndeficiency balance on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed. Applicant took \nout the loan for a vehicle for his son, with his son making the payments. His son was out \nof work and unable to make the payments, so he voluntarily returned the vehicle. This \ndebt and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($5,226) are not in the debt-resolution program, \nbut Applicant is in the process of enrolling them in the program. (Tr. at 22-25, 29-33; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, B) \nApplicant has not received formal financial counseling aside from any advice he \nreceived from the debt-settlement company. He credibly testified that he would continue \nwith the debt-resolution program until his debts are paid. The process has taken longer \nthan he anticipated, but it is working for him, and he is committed to it. His finances are \nnot perfect, but they are better than they were. He has the means to continue with the \nprogram until completion.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant had a good income while working overseas from about 2009 to 2013. \nHe did not make as much when he returned and relied on credit. His balances \nincreased to the point where it was difficult to keep up. He contracted with a debt-\nsettlement company in June 2018 to assist him in resolving his debts.

A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant still has debts to resolve, but I believe he is honest and sincere in his \nintentions to address his debts through the debt-resolution program. I find that he has a \nplan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant action to implement that \nplan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay \nhis debts. It may take time, but I am convinced he will eventually resolve his financial \nproblems. See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case \nNo. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May. 31, 2011): \u201cDepending on the facts of a given case, \nthe fact that an applicant\u2019s debts will not be paid off for a long time, in and of itself, may \nbe of limited security concern.\u201d The above mitigating conditions are sufficiently \napplicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nAppendix C of the adjudicative guidelines gives me the authority to grant \nconditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue information that can be partially but \nnot completely mitigated, with the provision that additional security measures shall be \nrequired to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the issues are \ncompletely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility for access to \nsensitive information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 16, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was taken under \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \non June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 28, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2023. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 28, 2023, scheduling the hearing for October 17, 2023.

The record was held \nopen until October 31, 2023, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which \nshe did. She requested an extension to provide other documents, which was granted until \nNovember 15, 2023, and extended to November 20, 2023. Her documents were marked \nAE I through P and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.d through 1.i. She \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.j, and 1.k. Her answer to SOR \u00b6 2.a was ambiguous and will be \nconsidered a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. She earned some college credits but not a degree. She \nwas married twice before her present marriage in 2020. She has an adult child. She has \nbeen employed by her present employer since September 2021. She explained that in \nher present job she works for four to six weeks and then is off for two to three months. \nShe has been on Social Security disability since 2007 and works part-time. She is \nparticipating in a re-entry work program to determine when she can return to 100% \nemployment. She has worked intermittently since 2007 and her part-time jobs subsidize \nher disability payments. On her November 2021 Questionnaire for National Security \nPosition (SF 85) she disclosed she was unemployed from 2016 to 2021. Her husband \nhas medical issues and had heart attacks in 2017 and 2018. In lieu of paying rent, he is \nthe property manager for the farm property where they live. He helps with the animals \nand does maintenance around the farm. He has no outside employment. (Tr. 16-23, 30-\n31; GE 1) \nApplicant attributes her financial issues to her husband\u2019s medical problems, her \nmother\u2019s failing health, and her limited income. She also stated that the pandemic \nimpacted her because she was unable to find part-time work, and she had to care for her \nmother because she did not have home health care. (Tr. 35-36) \nThe SOR allegations are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports \nfrom December 2021, July 2022, and January 2023. (GE 1-5) \nIn response to questions about her finances on her November 2021 SF 85, \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d that she did not have bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency. It also asked if in the past seven years she had an account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or canceled for failing to pay as agreed, which she also \nresponded \u201cno.\u201d (GE 1) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by the government investigator in December \n2021, she did not disclose her delinquent debts until she was confronted with them by the \ninvestigator. She acknowledged the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,305) was for a vehicle that she \npurchased in May 2019 and in January 2020 was repossessed when she returned it to \nthe dealer. She attributed being unable to pay for it due to the pandemic. She told the \ninvestigator that she would contact the creditor to arrange monthly payments and resolve \nthe debt within a year. She testified that she moved in with her mother when her mother \nneeded help. She returned the car because she knew she would not be able to make the \npayments. She testified that the cost of her medical bills increased, and she was unable \nto make the car payments. She has not resolved the debt because it is her largest, and \nshe intends to pay it after she pays her other debts. She said she also had some medical \nexpenses she had to pay. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 24, 45-47; GE 5) \nApplicant initially testified that the reason she failed to disclose she had delinquent \ndebts was because she was confused and nervous and she had recently moved. She \nsaid she had not received inquiries from creditors about her debts but knew her credit \nwas bad. She said she realized she should have responded to the SF 85 inquiries \ndifferently. When questioned further, she admitted that she was aware that she had a \nnumber of debts that were delinquent and was aware her vehicle had been voluntarily \nrepossessed. She said she did not intentionally lie about her debts. When asked why she \nfailed to disclose them, she stated, \u201cbecause I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t get the job.\u201d She \nfurther stated that her medical issues have an impact on her memory. I find Applicant was \naware she had delinquent debts and was aware of her duty to truthfully disclose her \ndelinquencies and deliberately failed to do so. (Tr. 23, 63-68; GE 1, 5) \nApplicant acknowledged the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($3,600), which became \ndelinquent in approximately November 2019. She told the investigator she was unable to \npay it due to insufficient income but intended to satisfy it with monthly payments within \nfive years. She testified the creditor reached out to her to settle the debt for $1,800. She \nsaid she contacted the creditor in August 2023. She is attempting to settle the debt for a \nlump-sum amount. In her post-hearing submission, she provided a document with the \nsettlement offer. She wrote on the document that she intended to accept the offer and \nsettle the debt by the end of 2023. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 48-50; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE \nJ, N) \nApplicant testified that she paid the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,773) for a \ndelinquent credit card. The record was held open for her to provide documents to \nsubstantiate her payments. She provided documents to show that she received a letter \nfrom the creditor in June 2022 indicating it had filed a lawsuit against her. She provided \nreceipts from July, August, and September 2022 showing she paid the amount owed. She \ndid not provide evidence that the creditor accepted her payments and is no longer \npursuing legal action, but based on her payments, it appears the debt is resolved. (Tr. 37, \n40, 44-45; AE J, K) \nApplicant testified that she paid the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,614) for a \ndelinquent credit card. She said the debt date back to 2019.

She provided a document \nfrom the creditor from August 2022 offering her a settlement agreement. She paid the \nsettlement amount in December 2022. Although there is no confirmation letter indicating \nthe debt is resolved, based on the documents it appears it is resolved. (Tr. 37, 40-45; AE \nI, J, K, L) \nApplicant resolved the collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($2,524-settled for $631) \nand 1.e ($2,499-settled for $606) in August 2022 and are reflected as paid on her January \n2023 credit report and other documents provided. (Tr. 36-37; GE 4; AE J, O, P) \nThe credit card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,901) and 1.g ($1,807) are owed to the \nsame creditor. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant told the investigator she would \ncontact the creditor in January 2022 and arrange monthly payments to satisfy the debts \nin one year. She testified that she made a partial payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f and \nwould provide documents to substantiate her actions. The record was held open for her \nto provide documents to substantiate her payments. She provided a document showing \nthat in early October 2023 she made a $1,000 payment and in late October she made a \npayment of $901 to resolve the balance owed on the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.f is resolved. SOR \n1.g is not resolved. (GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE I, M)  \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($75) and 1.k ($35) are unpaid medical debts. Applicant \ntold the investigator that she forgot to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k and she did not know \nwho the creditor was. She intended to pay this bill. She told the investigator that she \nintended to satisfy the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i with a lump-sum payment within six months. She \nadmitted she has been irresponsible in paying her bills. At her hearing, she testified that \nshe did not know who the creditor was for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and she took no action \nto find out who it might be. The accounts remain unpaid. (Tr. 54-55, 57; GE 2, 3, 4, 5) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($49) is an unpaid cable bill. She told the government \ninvestigator that she forgot to pay the remaining cable bill when she vacated her \nresidence. She intended to satisfy the debt within two weeks. She testified that when she \nvacated her residence, she thought the cable was turned off. She has not contacted the \ncreditor to dispute the debt and has not paid the bill. (Tr. 56; GE 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant testified that with her limited income, she is doing the best she can. She \nincurred student loan debt in 2003 and due to her disability, she was told she did not have \nto repay the loans. However, in 2015, when for a period she worked full time, the loans \nwere reinstated. She has not made any payments since 2015. The loans were delinquent \nprior to the pandemic and are currently in a deferred status. She owes approximately \n$6,625. (Tr. 58, 62-63) \nApplicant testified that she and her husband have about $1,100 in their bank \naccounts. They do not have retirement accounts or investments. They do not provide \nfinancial support for anyone. After paying their monthly expenses there is minimal \nexpendable income. Applicant said it was because she was paying her delinquent debts, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshe has less money. She does not keep a written budget and has not had financial \ncounseling. She has five credit cards that she is making payments on and the total \nbalance owed is about $800. (Tr. 24, 29-31, 34-35, 59-60) \nApplicant provided character letters. In them, she is described as honest, \n \n \n \n \ndependable, dedicated, trusted, loyal, responsible, hardworking, supportive, positive, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nprofessional, and an asset to her work. She is considered a person with exceptional \n \n \ncharacter and integrity. (AE A-F) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged will not be considered for \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying purposes but may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, \n \n \n \nin making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \n \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \n \ndecision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the sensitive information is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n \n \n \n \n \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity eligibility [or eligibility for a public trust position] will be resolved in favor of the \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \n \n \n \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\n \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \n \n \n  \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable public trust decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts and a history of financial problems. \nThere is sufficient evidence to apply the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant receives Social Security disability and works to supplement her income. \nHer husband does not work but they live rent-free because he manages the farm where \nthey are provided a house. She attributes her financial problems to being underemployed, \nunemployed during the pandemic, and caring for her elderly mother. She is unable to pay \nall of her debts. \nAfter completing her SF 85 and her interview with a government investigator, \nApplicant began addressing some of her delinquent debts and was able to settle several \nof them. She still has others that are not resolved, including a debt for a car she purchased \nand then returned to the dealer (SOR \u00b6 1.a $6,305). Her debts are ongoing and recent, \nand there is insufficient evidence that future financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThe conditions that resulted in Applicant\u2019s debts were beyond her control. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nShe was employed in 2021. After her interview with the government investigator, she \nbegan to address some of her debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application but does not \ncompletely apply. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant participated in financial counseling and there \nare not clear indications that Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. She still has her \nlargest debt to resolve and has not paid some of her smaller ones. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. AG \u00b6 20(d) has some application in that some debts are paid, but I do not consider \nher actions to be made in good faith as the collectors were contacting her and offering \nsettlements and one had filed a lawsuit. Applicant presented some mitigation, but her \nfinancial situation remains unstable, and the evidence is insufficient to mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nI find Applicant deliberately falsified her SF 85 when she answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestions about whether in the past seven years had she had any property repossessed, \nor if she had been over 120 days delinquent on any debts or if she was currently over 120 \ndays delinquent on any debt. However, these facts were not alleged in the SOR, and \nthere is insufficient evidence to conclude that she was aware that her debts were turned \nover to a collection agency or that she was aware if her accounts or credit cards were \nsuspended, charged off, or canceled for failing to pay as agreed. I find for Applicant under \nthis guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. She does not have a reliable financial track record at this time. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a public trust position. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline: \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate handling protected information and use of information \ntechnology concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive \nposition is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 12, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the handling protected information and use of \ninformation technology guidelines the DCSA CAF could not make the preliminary \naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6 Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and elected to have his case decided \non the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

Allegedly, these infractions and warnings are of continuing security concern. The \nallegations are cross-alleged under Guideline M. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations \nwith explanations. He denied only the allegations of SOR \u00b6 1.b, allowing access and \nuse of unauthorized software (Skype). He claimed there was no classified information \ninvolved in his cited October 2019 downloading infraction. He also claimed that the hard \ndrive he failed to properly secure in 2020 and 2021 he inherited from the person who \npreviously occupied his cubicle. \nApplicant claimed generally there was no formal process in place to perform a \ncomplete inventory of his office cubicle office when he started his employment with his \ncurrent employer. And, he claimed he has proven his trustworthiness through his work \nas a system administrator, in which he handled thousands of classified hard drives and \nsystem tapes, performed hundreds of software installations, and ensured that the \nclassified systems he was responsible for were compliant with all DoD security \nrequirements for the previous five plus years. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 60-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(Items 4-6) \nRecords document that in October 2019, Applicant self-reported to his information \nsecurity systems officer (ISSO) that he downloaded classified information on a compact \ndisc (CD) without authorization in September 2019 and left it unsecured on his desk in \nhis cubicle until October 2019. (Item 6) \nFurther investigation by his ISSO confirmed that Applicant had downloaded 12 \nfiles to a CD without authorization, failed to document the trusted downloads (TD) in e-\nBinder, and failed to properly label and secure the CD. His ISSO administrators found \nno loss or compromise of classified information and advised him of the need to properly \ndownload classified information in the future to ensure his understanding of proper \ndownloading procedures. (Item 6) \nIn April 2020, Applicant (while employed by his current employer) received a \nsecurity infraction notification with a verbal warning for allowing access and use of \nunauthorized software (Skype) on a classified information system without following \nrequired cybersecurity procedures. (Item 3) Applicant denied parts of the substantive \nallegation, claiming the software had been approved by his ISSO administrator. \nHowever, he admitted that his further testing of the software was unauthorized. (Item 3) \nIn their own investigation of the April 2020 incident, Applicant\u2019s ISSO \nadministrators confirmed that another employee of the company was in the process of \ngetting the Skype for business software certified for use on the company\u2019s information \nsystem (inclusive of ensuring that certain security controls were on the system and \ncertified for use) when the employee discovered that Applicant had been allowing \nemployees to use the program before the full certification could be finalized. (Item 6) \nWhile no loss or compromise of classified information was detected, Applicant was \nissued a verbal warning. (Item 6) \nIn May 2020, while still employed by his current employer, Applicant committed a \ncompany policy infraction when he inadvertently brought a cell phone into a closed \narea. (Items 3 and 6) Employer records affirm that Applicant self-reported the incident, \nand his employer\u2019s ISSO administrators confirmed the absence of any compromise of \nclassified information. \nUpon concluding their investigation, his ISSO administrators verbally warned him \nof his violation without the issuance of a security infraction.

(Item 3) Applicant\u2019s \nemployer\u2019s records reflect that Applicant acquired his hard drive in 2018, and the drive \nwas found when an employee of the company was moving into Applicant\u2019s cubical. \n(item 6) When asked by ISSO administrators about the hard drive, Applicant \nacknowledged his acquiring the drive when he joined the company in 2018 (believing at \nthe time that the drive was unclassified). \nISSO administrators in their investigation of the 2021 incident found Applicant\u2019s \nacquired hard drive to bear a classified label (albeit in a clear case with an unclassified \nsticker on the exterior), and, as such, was a classified hard drive that was improperly \nstored by Applicant for approximately two years without any evidence of a suspected \nloss or compromise of classified information. (Item 6) Based on the investigation\u2019s \nfindings, Applicant received a written warning. \nSince the investigated March 2021 incident, Applicant has been transferred to a \nnew position where he is no longer responsible for classified assets. (Item 5) He \nassured in his personal subject interview (PSI), conducted in February 2022, that should \nhe be assigned to another position in the chain of assets, he will be sure to check the \ninventory and ensure that all items are properly labeled.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  Handling Protected Information \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n                                   Use of Information Technology \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern. Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information-which includes classified \nand other sensitive government information, and proprietary information-\nraises doubt about and individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, \nor willingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. .  .  . AG \u00b6 33. \nThe Concern. Failure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \ncalling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive \nsystems, networks, and information. Information Technology includes \nany computer-based, mobile, or wireless device used to create, store, \naccess, process, manipulate, protect, or move information. This includes \nany component, whether integrated into a larger system, or not, such as \nhardware, software, or firmware used to enable or facilitate these \noperations.  . . . AG \u00b6 40. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Although \nthere is no probative evidence of loss or compromise of classified materials, security \nconcerns remain over Applicant\u2019s history of unauthorized misuse of classified \ninformation systems that required warnings and demands for corrective actions by his \nemployer\u2019s security and management personnel. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated negligent infractions of classified systems owned and \noperated by his employer warrant the application of DCs covered by Guideline K: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation,\u201d and 34(h) \u201cnegligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling \nby management\u201d; apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicable DCs under Guideline M are \nDCs \u00b6\u00b6 40(e), \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem,\u201d and 40(g), \u201cnegligent or lax security habits in handling information technology \nthat persist despite counseling by management,\u201d apply as well. \nTo be sure, none of the investigations prompted by Applicant\u2019s reported \ninadvertent misuse and mishandling of his employer\u2019s classified procedures and \nprocesses resulted in any loss or compromise of classified materials. Nonetheless, his \nmultiple breaches of established classified procedures and processes over an extended \nperiod of time (despite prior warnings and instructions) pose serious trust and judgment \nissues that effect his eligibility to access sensitive or classified information, or hold a \nsensitive position of trust. For mitigation purposes herein, the passage of time since his \nlast reported infraction in 2021 is still relatively recent. \nIn the face of proven acts of pattern negligence in misusing his employer\u2019s \nprocedures and processes for accessing and protecting classified information, \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgments of his judgment lapses and claims of learned lessons \ncome too late to meet the mitigating requirements of any of the potentially available \nmitigating conditions under Guideline K as well as those covered by Guideline M. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n             \n     \n \n \n             \n                                                 \n \n \n      \n \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged breaches of established procedures and processes for \naccessing classified procedures and processes breaches are still too recent to facilitate \nsafe predictions of recurrence avoidance in the foreseeable future. \nWhile this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of \nthe national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any required \nadherence to rules and regulations the Government may impose on the clearance \nholder employed by a defense contractor, the Government has the right to expect care \nand good judgment from the trust relationship it has with the clearance holder. See \nSnepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall trustworthiness, maturity, and good \njudgment required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or sensitive \nposition. At this time, he lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in his \ndemonstrated safe use of classified procedures and processes to facilitate safe \npredictions that he is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, and granting due weight to the \nacknowledgements made by Applicant of his past trust breaches and steps he is taking \nto avoid any recurrences, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable \nmitigation in the record to make safe predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to \navert recurrent trust breaches in the future when tasked with responsibility for protecting \nsensitive and classified information. Taking into account all of the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s pattern misuse of classified procedures and \nprocesses over the course of several years of documented infractions involving \nclassified information, he does not mitigate security concerns with respect to the \nallegations covered by SOR Guideline K, and M. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Applicant responded to the SOR on October \n20, 2022, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on January 9, 2023. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on January 20, 2023. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection.

He has worked in \nsecurity for his current employer or a predecessor company on the same contract since \nDecember 2020. He has a General Educational Development (GED) high school \nequivalency diploma. He has never married. He has one child. (Tr. at 21-22; GE 1) \nApplicant had periods of underemployment and unemployment when he did not \nhave medical insurance. (Tr. at 32-33; GE 1, 3) The SOR alleges a $9,966 auto loan \nthat was placed for collection and 20 delinquent medical debts totaling about $10,560. \nA credit report from February 2021 lists a $9,966 auto loan that was placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and 19 medical debts totaling about $9,523 that were placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d-1.u). There were no other debts, such as credit cards, on \nthe report. The $64 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (addressed below) was listed on \na June 2022 credit report. (GE 4, 5) \nApplicant stated that he cosigned an auto loan for his mother in about 2016. \nThey later became estranged, and he was unaware that she stopped paying the loan. It \nis unclear if the vehicle was ever repossessed. All three credit reporting agencies listed \nthe loan on the February 2021 credit report as an individual account with a balance of \n$9,966 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The activity date was January 2021. The loan is not listed on any of \nthe later credit reports. Applicant credibly testified that he thought it was a joint loan, but \nhe admitted that it is possible that he was the only one placed on the loan. He stated \nthat in either event, his mother had possession of the vehicle and was supposed to pay \nthe loan. (Tr. at 34-38; GE 4-6) \nApplicant retained a law firm in about September 2022 to assist him in verifying \nthe accuracy of debts on his credit report and disputing any inaccuracies. He also \ncompleted a financial counseling session. (Tr. at 18, 24-27, 40; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; AE A-D, F) \nThe February 2021 combined credit report lists a medical debt in the amount of \n$979, with a balance of $90 (SOR \u00b6 1.t). The debt was assigned in 2018, but the activity \ndate was February 2021. This appears to indicate that the debt was paid down from \n$979 to $90. The debt is not listed on later credit reports. (GE 2, 4-6; AE F) \nIn about January 2022, Applicant paid a $56 medical debt that was not alleged in \nthe SOR. He paid $64 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $78 (SOR \u00b6 1.u) medical debts in September \n2022. He testified that he paid a $393 medical debt. While he did not submit payment \ndocumentation, a $346 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.q) is reported by TransUnion in February 2021 \nand September 2022, but not in January 2023. (Tr. at 39; GE 2,4-6; AE E, F) \nThe June 2022 Experian credit report (GE 5) listed the paid $56 medical debt \nand unpaid debts of $64 (SOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 addressed above) and $938 (not alleged in the \nSOR). There are no other accounts of any kind reported.

The reports list the same joint \nauto loan and authorized-user credit card as listed on the 2022 Equifax credit report. \nThere are no other accounts with balances. (GE 4-6; AE F) \nApplicant\u2019s finances have stabilized. He lives a modest lifestyle. He is able to pay \nhis current bills without accruing any additional delinquent debts. He pays $147 per \nmonth on his auto loan, and he has some left over at the end of the month for savings \nand other issues. (Tr. at 23-24, 40-41; GE 5, 6) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJanuary 2021. He reported that he had a protective order issued against him in 2018, \nbut he answered \u201cNo\u201d to all of the financial questions under Section 26, which included \nthe following: \nIn the last seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? (Include financial obligations for which you were the \nsole debtor, as well as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor)1 \nApplicant credibly denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He stated that it was \nhis first time filling out an SF 86, he did not have much help with it, and he filled it out to \nthe best of his ability. (Tr. at 17-21, 41-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n1 There are other financial questions in the SF 86, but the SOR only alleged that Applicant falsified this \nquestion. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from underemployment, unemployment, \nand medical issues when he was uninsured. The debts alleged in the SOR did not result \nfrom irresponsible spending. They are medical debts and an auto loan that he took out \nfor his mother, with the understanding that she would pay it. Applicant is not financially \nsophisticated. He took the avenue that many others would, and he sought help from \nprofessionals. He paid some debts, and the law firm disputed others. I note that his \nearlier credit reports contained no accounts other than the auto loan and the medical \ndebts, none of which are listed on his current credit report. He now has an auto loan. He \nis only an authorized user on a credit card. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant does not present a \nperfect case in mitigation. Delinquent debts are a continuing concern until they are \nresolved. However, at some point, debts become old, unenforceable, charged off, fall off \ncredit reports, and are no longer of interest even to the creditors. In essence, Applicant \nreceived a fresh start. I note that he has taken advantage of that fresh start, and he is \nmaintaining fiscal responsibility. I believe he will continue to do so. I find that Applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncurrent finances do not cast doubt about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. Security concerns about his finances are \nmitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified the SF 86 when he failed to report the \ndebts alleged in the SOR under the following specific question: \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? (Include financial obligations for which you were the \nsole debtor, as well as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor). \nThere are other financial questions in the SF 86, but the SOR only alleged that \nApplicant falsified this question. To prove this allegation, the Government must prove by \nsubstantial evidence, among other things, that Applicant knew that he \u201chad bills or debts \nturned over to a collection agency.\u201d After considering all the evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s age, education, experience, the nature of his debts, the adverse information \nhe reported under another question, and his credible testimony, there is insufficient \nevidence for a finding that Applicant intentionally falsified the question alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.b or any other questions on the SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns and refuted the personal \nconduct security concerns.2 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n2 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nfinancial issues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances. \n7 \n",

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn September 16, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). (Items 1, 2.) \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 7, 2022, and requested that her case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 3.) \nOn October 26, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, \nwas mailed to Applicant, and received by her on November 28, 2022.

On January 26, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the three SOR allegations contained in SOR Paragraph 1, \nwithout further elaboration or explanation. (Item 3) Her admissions are incorporated into \nthese findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. She is unmarried and has no children. She earned a high \nschool diploma in June 2010 and has taken some community college courses. She has \nno record of military or federal civil service, and has never held a security clearance. She \nis sponsored to seek national security eligibility in connection with possibly obtaining a \nposition at a professional services Government contracting company. (Items 2, 4.) \nApplicant completed her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on January 21, 2022. In response to questions in Section 23 regarding illegal use \nof \ndrugs \nor \ndrug \nactivity, \nshe \ndisclosed \nthat \nshe \nhad \nillegally \nused \nTHC/marijuana/cannabis from January 2010 to January 2021, at which point she obtained \na Medical Cannabis Card from her state and continued \u201clegally\u201d using it until January \n2022. She further declared that she intended to continue using the drug in the future, and \ntended to use it only when she had trouble sleeping or eating. (Item 4.) \nOn April 26, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). She confirmed the accuracy of her e-QIP statements \nconcerning drug use, and added that she had been spending about $150 per month on \nmarijuana or THC vaping products until January 2022, and smoking several times each \nweek. She said that she stopped purchasing and using medical marijuana at that point \nsince she was unsure how it would affect her pending job application and national security \neligibility. She said she had purchased marijuana from licensed dispensaries after \nobtaining her Card in January 2021, and illegally obtained it from friends, acquaintances, \nor off the street before that. Once she started buying medical marijuana, her association \nand contact with many of those acquaintances became less frequent. (Item 5.) \nApplicant also said that her present employer is aware of her use of medical \nmarijuana since she tested positive on a February 2021 random drug test. She expressed \nto the OPM investigator that she would like to go back to using medical marijuana \nbecause it benefits her health greatly, but she would also like to secure her pending \nemployment with the Federal contractor. She said that if the employer prohibits medical \nmarijuana use even with her state-issued Card, then she would not be engaged with it \nany longer and would have to find alternatives to assist with her health concerns.

There \nis no indication that she was ever evaluated for, or diagnosed with, a substance use \ndisorder, or participated in a treatment program. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, \ndemeanor, or character in person, since she elected to have her case decided without a \nhearing. \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concerns related to this guideline: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. Four are established in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana and cannabis-derived THC products on \na regular basis from January 2010 until at least January 2022, and expressed her \nintention to continue doing so. She tested positive for marijuana on a random urinalysis \nconducted by her employer in February 2021. Her statement to the OPM investigator, \nthat she would stop using marijuana if she needed to for her potential job or to get a \nsecurity clearance, does not constitute a clear and convincing commitment to discontinue \nher long-term substance misuse. The evidence raised the above disqualifying conditions, \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe record evidence does not support mitigation under any of these conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use began when she was 17 years old, and continued on a regular \nbasis until at least January 2022. Her claimed intent to stop violating Federal drug laws, \nif her potential job warranted that, was tentatively expressed to the OPM investigator three \nmonths after her e-QIP declaration to the contrary. She has not changed her association \nwith the environment where her drug use occurred, and only partially reduced her \ncontacts with the friends and acquaintances involved. No mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) \nor 26 (b) was established. Applicant has neither sought nor participated in any drug \ntreatment, rehabilitation, or aftercare program; and no medical professional supplied a \nfavorable prognosis. There is no evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(d). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s lengthy pattern of \nillegally purchasing and using controlled substances leaves me with significant doubts as \nto her eligibility for a security clearance. Her statement to the OPM investigator that she \nwould stop using illegal drugs if she needed to for her job or to obtain a security clearance \nis neither convincing nor mitigating. Her regular violations of Federal and, until 2021, state \ncriminal laws for her personal benefit and enjoyment preclude a reasonable conclusion \nthat she could be relied upon to comply with security-related requirements for the \nprotection of classified and sensitive information that she might find to be inconvenient or \nburdensome. She did not meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nthe guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not respond to the \nFORM. The SOR and the Answer are the pleadings in the case. (Items 1S and 1A, \nrespectively.)  Items 2 through 6 are admitted without objection. The case was assigned \nto me on June 1, 2023.  \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 47 years old and a high school graduate with some college credits. He \nwas married from June 1995 to June 2005. He has 19 year-old twins from that marriage; \nthey do not live with him. He remarried in June 2005 and has two children ages 12 and \n15 from that marriage; they reside with him. He has two adult stepchildren. (Items 2 and \n3.) Except for a brief period of unemployment from January 2014 to March 2014, he has \nworked full-time since July 2011. From February 2020 to the present, he has worked for \na defense contractor. (Item 2.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) is indebted to the Internal \nRevenue Service for $3,352 for tax year 2014; and (2) failed to file state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 and 2015. (Item 1S.) He admitted those allegations. (Item 1A.) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October and November 2021 personal subject interviews (PSI), \nhe discussed his financial matters. He identified seven accounts with nominal balances \nranging from $61 to $864 totaling $2,404. (Item 3.) Those accounts are not reported on \nhis January 3, 2023 credit report and are not alleged in the SOR. (Items 1S and 6.) \nApplicant also discussed three significant debts. The first was a child support debt \nfor $32,000. In May 2015 he began a court-approved payment plan and paid off that debt \nin February 2021. (Item 3.) That debt was not alleged in the SOR and was not reported \non the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Items 1S, 5 and 6.) \nThe second was a debt Applicant owed to the state department of revenue for \n$14,146 of taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. In 2015, he started a payment plan. He \nwas on that plan as of his PSI. That debt was not alleged in the SOR and was not reported \non the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Items 1S, 5 and 6.) \nThe Government\u2019s interrogatories asked Applicant to provide state tax account \ntranscripts (or the equivalent) for years 2014 and 2015. He responded: \u201cI was told that \n[the state] does not issue Tax Account Transcripts at all. Only the IRS does. I requested \n[IRS] copies for the years in question (2014 & 2015) online.\u201d He attached IRS transcripts \nfor tax years 2014 and 2015. They shed no light on his state tax filings.

In \n2017, he changed jobs and did not have enough money to make his payments. The auto \nwas repossessed in July 2017 and sold, which left a balance due of $7,000. He began a \npayment plan on November 19, 2021, of $300 a week to pay the balance. (Item 3.) This \naccount was reported in collection on the Government\u2019s October 2021 credit report. (Item \n5.) It was not reported on the Government\u2019s January 3, 2023 credit report and was not \nalleged in the SOR. (Items 1S and 6.) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report shows 10 accounts PAYS AS AGREED with \nzero past-due amounts and no tax delinquencies or tax liens. (Item 6.) His earlier credit \nreport does not show any tax delinquencies or tax liens. (Item 5.) Other than Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the two SOR allegations, there is no other record support for the SOR\u2019s \ntwo allegations. (Item 1A.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. A2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is the only one applicable in this case: \n(f)  failure to file . . . annual . . .  state . . . income tax returns . . . or failure \nto pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid federal income taxes and his failure to file state income tax \nreturns are established by the admissions in his Answer. AG \u00b619 (f) applies. The next \ninquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s federal income tax \ndelinquency of $3,352 occurred in 2015 for tax year 2014, almost 10 years ago. This was \na one-time occurrence and has not recurred. In fact, other than his Answer to the SOR, \nthe Government submitted no evidence to support this allegation. In addition, the \nmagnitude of this delinquency does not raise any national security concerns. SOR \u00b6 1.a \nhas been mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s PSI, he started a payment plan in 2015 to pay $14,146 of \nback state income taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. He was still on that plan at the time \nof his PSI. I will take administrative notice that tax authorities customarily do not allow a \ndelinquent taxpayer to begin a payment plan, unless the taxpayer has first filed returns \nfor the tax years in question. Therefore, he must have filed his 2014 and 2015 returns in \norder to have embarked on a payment plan. SOR \u00b6 1.b has been mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n20(g). \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b and admitted all remaining allegations in the SOR. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since August 2019. He served on active duty in the United States Navy from 1987 to 2007. He retired at the rank of E-7 with an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while serving on active duty for approximately 18 years. When he retired, he worked for a defense contractor until he was laid off in 2010. He was unemployed between December 2010 and August 2014. During this period, he was a full-time student attending college using his GI bill benefits. He graduated in 2014 with an associate degree. After graduating, he worked for several employers prior to his current position. He has been married since September 2012. He has two children from prior marriages and his wife has three children from prior marriages. The children are 17, 19, 22, 25 and 27. With the exception of the oldest child, all children live with them. (Tr. 18-20, 22-26; Gov 1) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges two tax debts, five commercial debts, and two medical debts, totalling approximately $4,396.

The case was assigned to me on June 14, 2023. On September 21, \n2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for August 29, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled via video-\nteleconference. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 - 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered one exhibit \nwhich was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, without objection. The record was held \nopen until September 12, 2023, to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. He timely \nsubmitted two exhibits which were admitted as AE B and AE C, without objection. On \nSeptember 12, 2023, DOHA received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing. The record closed \non that date. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b and admitted \nall remaining allegations in the SOR. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nAdditional findings follow. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He has worked for his current employer since August 2019. He served \non active duty in the United States Navy from 1987 to 2007. He retired at the rank of E-7 \nwith an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while serving on active duty \nfor approximately 18 years. When he retired, he worked for a defense contractor until he \nwas laid off in 2010. He was unemployed between December 2010 and August 2014. \nDuring this period, he was a full-time student attending college using his GI bill benefits. \nHe graduated in 2014 with an associate degree. After graduating, he worked for several \nemployers prior to his current position. He has been married since September 2012. He \nhas two children from prior marriages and his wife has three children from prior marriages. \nThe children are 17, 19, 22, 25 and 27. With the exception of the oldest child, all children \nlive with them. (Tr. 18-20, 22-26; Gov 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges two tax debts, five commercial debts, and two medical debts, \ntotalling approximately $4,396. Specifically, Applicant owes State A $500 for delinquent \ntaxes for tax year 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 6-7).

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) In April \n2022, he set up a payment plan with State A to resolve the taxes owed. He agreed to pay \n$50 a month. The first payment began on May 2, 2022. As of April 21, 2023, the balance \nowed was $1,816.28. He has an allotment set up to make monthly payments. He believes \nhe has six months remaining on the payment plan. He regrets not resolving this situation \nsooner. (Tr. 27-30; AE A)  \nApplicant disputes that he owes state income taxes to State B for tax year 2008. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant moved from State A to State B in late 2008. He started a new job \nlocated in State B in December 2008. When filing his 2008 income tax returns, he \nreceived tax assistance from a tax counselor at a local Army installation. (Local military \ninstallations often provide free tax service for uncomplicated income tax returns.) \nApplicant was advised by the tax counselor that he did not need to file state income tax \nreturns for State B because he worked in State B for less than one month and did not \nearn enough income in State B to warrant filing a state income tax return for 2008. (Tr. \n31-32) \nApproximately, five or six years later, State B contacted Applicant and told him that \nhe owes state income taxes for the entire year for 2008, even though he only worked in \nState B for one month. State B claims he owes them $7,000. Applicant admits he ignored \nthe tax issue involving State B because he did not have the money. He plans to dispute \nthe 2008 tax debt that State B claims he owes. He needs to get documentation from State \nA to show to State B that he worked and paid taxes to State A the majority of the year in \n2008. (Tr. 32-33) This is complicated by the fact that he did not timely pay the taxes owed \nto State A for tax year 2008 and is in the process of resolving the tax debt to State A \nbefore he can present evidence to resolve the tax issue with State B. \nAside from tax year 2008, Applicant timely files his state and federal income tax \nreturns each year. He has no other tax issues or liens. (Tr. 34) \nThe status of the remaining delinquent accounts are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $1,511 delinquent cell phone account placed for collection: Applicant \nadmits this debt but has made no arrangements to for pay this debt.

(Tr. 40-41) Most of the debts became delinquent between 2017 and 2019. \nDuring this time period, Applicant\u2019s income was not sufficient to meet expenses. \nApplicant\u2019s annual income was approximately $35,000 during this time period. His wife \nearned approximately $32 per hour. He and his family were renting a home on a former \nmilitary base. The rent and expenses were much cheaper than living off base. The base \nclosed the family housing and he and his family had to move off base, which increased \nhis monthly expenses. His rent increased from $1,100 to $1,700. His priority was to put \nfood on the table and pay his bills. Taking care of family was more important to him. All \nof the children lived with them and they also took in a friend of his son who was kicked \nout of his house. He lived with them for eight to ten months.

(AE B) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations: and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies regarding the tax debts owed to State A and \nState B. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Aside from the payment plan for 2008 state income \ntaxes to State A, Applicant has not attempted to resolve any of the accounts alleged in \nthe SOR. He ignored his income tax situation from 2008 for more than a decade. As a \nresult, what should have been an easy problem to solve became more complicated. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to take steps to resolve his delinquent debts raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor several years, Applicant\u2019s income was lower. Around 2017, he was forced to \nmove his family from more affordable rental housing on a local military installation to rental \nhousing in the local economy. This resulted in increased expenses. Circumstances \nbeyond his control contributed to his financial issues. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nHowever, it is given less weight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He neglected to resolve his tax problems related to whether he \nowed State B for state income taxes for tax year 2008 for years. He has paid off some \ndebts that were not alleged in the SOR, but did not come up with a plan to settle the \nremaining delinquent debts. Aside from the state tax issues, the total amount of the debt \nis $4,396. He did not act responsibly under the circumstances. \nWhile Applicant testified that he has attended financial counseling, he admits he \nhad difficulty following a budget and a payment plan. While Applicant intends to pay his \ndebts, there is no clear indication that the problem is being resolved or under control. If \nApplicant meets with a financial counselor from a legitimate and credible source, such as \na non-profit counseling service, and follows their advice, he is capable of resolving his \ndelinquent accounts. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s payment plan for the 2008 income \ntax debt with State A. He is making timely payments by monthly allotment. He has not \ntaken steps to resolve the remaining debts so this mitigating factor is given less weight. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant may have a legitimate dispute about filing \nand paying state income taxes in State B in 2008 because he only earned income in State \nB during the last month of the year. He was given bad advice and failed to file state \nincome tax returns in State B. He learned he owed state income taxes to State B several \nyears later. Instead of confronting the problem immediately, Applicant ignored the issue. \nThe issue remains unresolved at the close of the record. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s state income tax debt owed to State \nA. He is making timely and regular payments towards the tax debt to State A. However, \nthe tax issue with State B remains unresolved.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that failure to comply with tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and \nsystems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns \nand paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nOverall, Applicant did not meet his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised \nunder financial considerations. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service in the United States Navy as well as his \nfavorable employment with several DOD contractors. I considered the support he \nprovides to his wife and family. With some financial counseling and planning, Applicant \nhas sufficient financial resources to pay his delinquent debts and resolve the 2008 state \nincome tax situation. He did not take sufficient action before the hearing to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. \nThe security concerns raised under Financial Considerations are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.h, 1.i:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1:g: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 22-24, 30, 62; Answer; \nGE 1, 6; AE A) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his 2018 \nfederal income tax return (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and his seven delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $117,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h). The financial delinquencies consist \nof the following: federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c); credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.e, 1.g, and 1.h); and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He admitted the SOR allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f through 1.h, with additional comments. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. He denied the remainder of the SOR allegations because he \nclaimed to have resolved those debts prior to the issuance of the SOR. However, the \nSOR allegations are established through his admissions, the Government\u2019s credit \nreports, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax records. (Answer; GE 1-6) \nWhile Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for tax year \n2018, he provided sufficient evidence that this failure was largely the fault of his CPA, \nwith whom he has worked since 2009. His CPA attempted to timely file the relevant \nincome tax return, but it was not accepted by the IRS. With the help of his CPA, he has \nlate filed this income tax return. The evidence shows that this failure to timely file his \nincome tax return was a one-off and not a recurring problem with him or his CPA. While \na failure to pay his federal income taxes for tax year 2018 is not alleged, he provided \nevidence that he paid those taxes. (Tr. 27-28, 32-33, 40-42; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE D\u00ad\nG) \nIn October 2017, Applicant entered a payment arrangement with the IRS to pay \nhis delinquent taxes for tax year 2016. He satisfied these taxes on October 17, 2022. In \nDecember 2021, he entered a payment arrangement with the IRS to pay his delinquent \ntaxes for tax year 2020. The IRS acknowledged that he paid his delinquent taxes for tax \nyear 2020 on October 25, 2022. He refinanced the mortgage on his home and used the \nequity to finish paying those taxes. He no longer owes any federal taxes and received a \nrefund for tax year 2022. He also used the equity from his refinance to pay off $50,000 \nin non-delinquent credit-card debt that was not listed in the SOR. (Tr. 42-45, 58, 74-76, \n84; Answer; AE D, E, H, I) \nIn about March 2018, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt \nconsolidation company (DCC) to get a grip on his finances and to settle his consumer \ndebts. He enrolled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h, as well as several other \nconsumer debts not listed in the SOR.

The DCC program was \ninitially scheduled to last three years, but because the COVID-19 pandemic slowed \nnegotiations with creditors, it has lasted longer. (Tr. 35-36, 39, 45-56, 76-80; Answer; \nGE 1-6; AE B, J, K) \nThrough the DCC program, Applicant has settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and is \ncurrently paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. DCC is still negotiating a settlement agreement \nwith the creditors of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, and no payments have been \nmade on these accounts. He has settled four accounts that are not listed in the SOR. \nOverall, he has paid $87,000 towards his total enrolled debt of $154,000. He currently \npays about $1,460 per month into the DCC account, but that amount varies depending \nupon what debts are being paid at any given time. Applicant\u2019s plan is to continue his \nagreement with DCC until all the enrolled debts are paid. He also placed his home on \nthe market about three months prior to the hearing with the hope of using equity from \nthe sale to pay about $30,000 to DCC, at which point they will be required to settle his \nremaining enrolled debts with no further payment from him. He considers his hiring of \nDCC to represent financial counseling. (Tr. 35-36, 39, 45-56, 68, 76-84; Answer; GE 1-\n6; AE B, J, K)  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in about 2010 when he took a hiatus from \nworking in Afghanistan, came back to the United States, and was voluntarily \nunemployed. During this time, he withdrew about $70,000 from a retirement account to \nmaintain the lifestyle he was living while he was employed. He did not withhold enough \nmoney for the taxes he incurred from these withdrawals. He also was not withholding \nenough money from his wages for income taxes, resulting in owing income tax at the \nend of several tax years. Judging from his receipt of an income tax refund in 2022, he \nhas fixed that issue. (Tr. 25-33, 58, 61-62; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE A, E, J) \nApplicant failed to realize that a creditor stopped his automatic payments on one \nof his credit cards not alleged in the SOR for three months as emergency relief for \nHurricane Harvey in 2017. When he realized he had not made payments for several \nmonths, he could not afford to pay the balance and enrolled with DCC. He notified his \nfacility security officer that he had enrolled with DCC and listed his tax and other \ndelinquencies in his December 2020 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (SF 86). I observed Applicant while he testified and found him to be \ncredible. His willingness to report potentially derogatory information bolsters this finding. \n(Tr. 25-34, 62; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE E, J) \nApplicant earns $138,000, annually in wages. His current monthly earnings are \nnearly subsumed by his monthly expenses. His current mortgage alone is $3,800 per \nmonth. He has about $5,000 in a checking account. He has depleted almost all his \nretirement savings with the exception of about $600. He is hopeful that he will get a \npromotion at work that will increase his salary to $145,000, annually. When he left his \njob in Afghanistan in 2010, he was making over $200,000, annually.

(Tr. 38-40, 58-73, 82; GE 2, 6, 10) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAs evidenced by his income tax delinquency as early as 2016, and his other \nfinancial delinquencies and need to hire DCC beginning in 2018, Applicant has a history \nof being unable to pay his debts, including his federal income taxes. The above listed \nconditions are applicable, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax return for the 2018 tax year \nwas a one-time occurrence arguably caused by his CPA that has since been remedied. \nI find that allegation mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(b), and AG \u00b6 20(g). \nWhile caused by his own errors that were not largely beyond his control, \nApplicant paid his delinquent federal taxes prior to the issuance of the SOR. He owes \nno federal taxes. He received an income tax refund for tax year 2022, so he appears to \nhave remedied the issue he had with not withholding sufficient taxes from his wages. I \nfind that his delinquent federal taxes are mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(g). \nAll but one of the remaining SOR debts are unresolved. Applicant\u2019s income \nbarely exceeds his expenses. Despite paying off a significant amount of past-due debt, \nhe still has about $30,000 in non-delinquent credit-card debt. He entered into a \ncontingent contract to purchase a home that will significantly increase his debt. This \ncontract is contingent upon him selling his home and making more money, and he has \ntestified that he can (and might) cancel the contract unilaterally. I am hopeful that he \nmakes a fiscally responsible decision regarding this contract, however, given his current \nincome and expenses and outstanding delinquent debt, his financial problems are \nongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to his remaining SOR debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s remaining SOR debts were caused by spending beyond his means, \nnot properly monitoring his debts, and voluntarily defaulting as advised by DCC. These \ncauses were not largely beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to those debts. \nWhile DCC is assisting him with addressing his consumer debts by negotiating \nsettlements and distributing payments, he has provided insufficient evidence to show \nthat these services constitute \u201cfinancial counseling.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply to his \nremaining SOR debts. \nIn 2018, Applicant engaged DCC to assist him with resolving his consumer \ndelinquencies. For over five years, he has consistently made the required payments to \nDCC. While he has only resolved one of the consumer debts in the SOR through this \nprogram, he has resolved four other consumer debts not listed in the SOR. He has paid \nabout 60 percent of his remaining, delinquent debts. He credibly testified that he will \ncontinue to make the required payments until the remainder of his debts are resolved. \nHe is also attempting to sell his house to use the equity to make a lump-sum payment to \nDCC to insure that he meets their requirements to have the debts resolved with no \nrecurring payments. While DCC\u2019s progress has been slow, I do not find that fact \nsufficiently detracts from his ability to show that his effort is made in good faith. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies to the remaining SOR debts. \nA meaningful track record of debt reform includes evidence that debts have been \npaid off or resolved. An applicant is not required to show that every debt in the SOR has \nbeen paid, and there is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2014). Rather, an applicant is required to demonstrate that he or she has \u201cestablished a \nplan to resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan.\u201d There is also no requirement that the first debts paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan are the SOR debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). Guideline F mitigation does not require the payment of all the SOR debts. \nInstead, it requires that Applicant remove trustworthiness and reliability concerns raised \nby those debts. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3. \nApplicant\u2019s DCC arrangement, his refinancing of his mortgage to pay \nindebtedness, his viable plan to sell his home to pay indebtedness, and his viable plan \nto live rent and mortgage free to save money demonstrate that he has established a \nplan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that \nplan. While an affirmative commitment to cancel the contingency contract would have \nbeen preferable, his credible testimony that he may cancel it helps resolve any doubts \nabout his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge must consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on November 15, 2022. The FORM proffered four \nexhibits (Items 1 \u2013 4) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. \nAttached to the FORM and its exhibits was an unmarked Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Republic of Iraq. I have included it in the record as Hearing Exhibit \n(HX) 1. It consists of a six-page memorandum and six supporting documents labeled I \nthrough VI. \nApplicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits or to provide other additional information. He timely responded to \nthe FORM and submitted information in support of his case. Department Counsel waived \nobjection to the admissibility of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (hereinafter \u201cRTF\u201d). \nApplicant did not otherwise comment on or object to the Government\u2019s exhibits. \nAccordingly, GX 1 \u2013 4, HX 1, and the RTF became part of the record, which closed on \nDecember 14, 2022. I received the case for decision on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s parents (SOR 1.a) and two \nbrothers (SOR 1.b) are citizens and residents of Iraq. It also alleged that his sister is a \ncitizen and resident of Iraq who is employed by the Iraqi government (SOR 1.c). It was \nfurther alleged that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq (SOR 1.d); \nthat Applicant\u2019s two children are citizens of Iraq (SOR 1.e); and that Applicant owns \nresidential property in Iraq (SOR 1.f). (FORM, Item 1) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations and comment all of \nthe SOR allegations. (FORM, Item 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, and based on my review of the information presented in the FORM, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked since July 2021. He was born and raised in Iraq, where he completed his college \neducation in June 2004. He and his wife, who also was born and raised in Iraq, were \nmarried in July 2006. They have two children, ages 15 and 10. Applicant, his wife, and \ntheir children are naturalized U.S. citizens. They have lived together in the United States \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nsince immigrating from Iraq in 2014. SOR 1.e alleges that his children are Iraqi citizens. \n(FORM, Item 3; RTF) \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2020. In his e-QIP, he did not \nprovide naturalization information about his wife and children. In response to the FORM, \nhe provided copies of their U.S. passports that were issued in August and September \n2020, respectively. The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s children are Iraqi citizens, \nsomething he acknowledged may still be the case; however, it also is clear that they and \ntheir parents are U.S. citizens who have been living together and continuously in the \nUnited States for over eight years. SOR 1.e is resolved for Applicant. (FORM, Items 3 \nand 4; RTF) \nBetween April 2007 and November 2014, Applicant worked for an Iraqi bank. \nStarting in 2008, he was vetted for work at the bank\u2019s branch inside the U.S. Embassy in \nBaghdad\u2019s Green Zone. Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that he was investigated and \napproved for access to the embassy. He also provided copies of U.S. government-issued \nidentification cards he used for access to the Green Zone and the embassy itself. In June \n2011, the embassy\u2019s Senior Financial Management Officer provided a memorandum in \nwhich he roundly praised Applicant\u2019s work as a point of contact between his staff and the \nIraqi bank in the conduct of essential financial transactions and in working with Iraqi \nvendors in support of U.S. military requirements in Iraq. Applicant left his embassy \nposition (it appears he remained with the bank until 2014) that same month after the \ncontract between the bank and the U.S. Department of State was modified. When \nApplicant left the embassy, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq presented him with a certificate \nof appreciation for his dedication to and support of the U.S. mission in Iraq. (FORM, Item \n3; RTF) \nApplicant immigrated to the United States on what Department Counsel termed \n\u201can unspecified visa\u201d and \u201creceived Government financial support for refugees.\u201d (FORM \nat 2-3.) In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he \u201ccame to the U.S. through the \nIOM program due to my job as a contractor with the U.S. government.\u201d (RTF) The IOM \nprogram to which he referred is the International Organization for Migration \n(https://mena.iom.int/iraq), a non-governmental organization (NGO) whose mission is to \nassist persons who must relocate after being displaced by conflict. It is likely that Applicant \nreceived assistance from this NGO or from the U.S. government in expediting his \nimmigration to the United States. \nAfter he arrived in the United States, and after a three-month period of \nunemployment, Applicant started working in the computer and information technology (IT) \nindustry. From February 2015 to the present, he has been steadily employed in such jobs. \nIn addition to his full-time jobs, between May 2015 and February 2019, he supplemented \nhis income by working part-time in ridesharing jobs. In 2016, Applicant bought the house \nin the Unites States where he and his family still live. All of his personal, community, \nprofessional, and financial interests are in the neighborhood where he is raising his \nchildren.

His father is a retired government employee, and his mother has never \nworked outside the home. Applicant speaks with them as often as daily. His sister is an \nemployee of an Iraqi government agency. He speaks with her monthly or in person during \nvisits to see his parents (Applicant has traveled to Iraq in 2016 and 2021).  Applicant \naverred that his sister\u2019s work does not relate to any military, security, intelligence, or \nforeign relations interests by the Iraqi government. Applicant\u2019s brothers and his father-in-\nlaw, who is a physician, have no apparent connection to the Iraqi government. One \nbrother works for a trade association, the other a car dealer. The record does not reflect \nwhat level of contact Applicant has with his brothers or with his father-in-law, either directly \nor through his wife. Applicant averred that none of his relatives in Iraq know that he is \napplying for a security clearance. They only know that he works in the IT field. (FORM, \nItems 2 \u2013 4; RTF) \nPrior to his departure from Iraq in 2014, Applicant started building a new house for \nhis family; however, it was not completed until 2017. Applicant\u2019s parents moved into the \nhouse because theirs had been demolished, and they needed a place to live pending \ncompletion of construction of a new house. Applicant\u2019s parents and his brothers now live \nin the house. Applicant wants to bring his parents to live in the U.S. with him. To that end, \nhis house in Iraq is now on the market. Applicant does not receive rent for the house and \nthere is no indication in this record about its value. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4; RTF)  \nTo properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Iraq as \npresented in HX 1. Iraq is a constitutional republic, and its most recent parliamentary \nelections in 2021 were assessed by European Union and United Nations observers to be \nfree and fair. Nonetheless, as to Iraq in general, concerns remain over the continued \ninability of that freely-elected government to quell the violence and instability that persist \nin some parts of that country. These conditions are fueled and perpetrated by terrorist \ngroups affiliated with Al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-\nbacked Shiite militias. As a result, some parts of Iraq, mainly in areas south of Baghdad, \nsuch as Basrah, remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still subject to \nrandom acts of terrorist violence. U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for \nkidnapping and terrorist violence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all \nindividual travel to Iraq. The ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services at \nthe U.S. consulate in Basrah is extremely limited given the security environment, while \nthe U.S. embassy in the IKR capital of Erbil remains open. While ISIS insurgent groups \nremain active in Iraq, their control over large swaths of Iraq has been diminished by U.S. \nand coalition efforts. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and western companies \nthroughout Iraq. U.S. Government and western interests remain possible targets for \nattacks. \nAdditionally, there are significant human-rights problems in Iraq. Widespread \ncorruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of violence by \nterrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi central government and its \njudiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and are \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting \ncivilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest \nand lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, \nfreedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal \nabuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for \nsignificant human rights abuses in Iraq. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAs to SOR 1.f, which alleges only that Applicant owns \u201cresidential property in Iraq,\u201d \nthe only possible Guideline B disqualifying condition pertinent to that allegation is at AG \n\u00b6 7(f): \nsubstantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or \nin any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. (emphasis added) \nAvailable information does not support show any value associated with Applicant\u2019s \nproperty in Iraq, much that it is substantial. SOR 1.f is not established and is resolved for \nthe Applicant. \nNonetheless, available information shows that Applicant has close ties to citizens \nof Iraq residing in Iraq. It also shows that he continues to be in contact with those persons. \nOverall, the political and military situation in Iraq continues to present a heightened risk \nthat his relatives may be pressured or coerced by groups hostile to U.S. interests as a \nmeans of compromising Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to protect sensitive U.S. \ninformation. The disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a) applies: \ncontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAdditionally, because Applicant\u2019s sister works for an agency within the Iraqi \ngovernment, the record supports application of AG \u00b6 7(b): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nBy contrast, I have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe record does not support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c). Applicant\u2019s ties in \nIraq, a country that presents a heightened risk of coercion, are familial and presumed to \nbe close. Available information in support of that presumption includes frequent contact \nwith and a recent visit to Iraq to visit his parents. Nonetheless, balanced against the \nheightened risk presented by the state of affairs in Iraq is the information about Applicant\u2019s \nwork in support of U.S. interests in Iraq and his circumstances as a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen whose roots are wholly planted in the United States for most of the past ten years. \nThat information supports application of AG \u00b6 8(b) and is sufficient, on balance, to mitigate \nthe security concerns established under AG \u00b6 7. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline B, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was vetted as a trusted \nforeign national for work in the Green Zone and inside the U.S. embassy in Iraq. He \nestablished a record of trustworthiness and dedication in support of U.S. interests in a \nwar zone that shows he will resolve any conflict of interest generated from his foreign ties \nin favor of the United States. The record evidence as a whole supports a fair and \ncommonsense decision in favor of the Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.t). Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nthis employer since September 2020. She is an accounting technician. She has been \ncontinuously employed since 2006. She is a high school graduate. She married in 1995 \nand was divorced in 2009. She has no children. (Items 2-3) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed 20 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$26,500. The debts were comprised of consumer debts, mostly delinquent credit cards. \nThe allegations are supported by credit reports from March 2022 and March 2023, her \nanswers to questions from a background investigator in April 2022, and admissions in \nher SOR answer. (Items 2-6) \nApplicant explained that she got into financial difficulties in 2004, when she \nseparated from her then husband and met a person who would become her girlfriend \nuntil approximately 2019 when the relationship ended. Applicant described her former \ngirlfriend as mentally abusive. In order to keep the girlfriend happy, Applicant applied for \nand received 20 credit cards, in her name, to pay for a lifestyle the girlfriend demanded, \nbut which Applicant could not afford. She also financed the girlfriend\u2019s expensive hobby \nof restoring cars. Applicant was the primary wage earner and paid all the bills in the \nrelationship. Her girlfriend worked as a parttime dog groomer. Applicant claims not to \nhave applied for or used any credit cards since 2017. (Item 6) \nApplicant admitted all the debts in her SOR answer. She also provided the \nfollowing explanations about her SOR debts: \u201cThis has been taken care of and no \nlonger on credit report,\u201d or \u201cWorking on this now.\u201d She provided documentation that she \npaid one payment of approximately $57 toward SOR \u00b6 1.t in March 2023. She claimed \nthat she has two payments left to make on this account. She failed to provide \ndocumentation showing that the remaining SOR debts were paid directly or through a \npayment plan. All the SOR debts were listed on her March 2022 credit report, but some \nof these debts were not listed on her March 2023 credit report. They may have aged off \nby this time, but there is no evidence that Applicant paid them. (Items 2, 4-5; AE A1-3) \nApplicant documented that she is current and making regular payments on a \ncredit card that does not appear to be an SOR debt. On this account she made two $10 \npayments in January 2023, on a balance of $428. She also made two $20 payments in \nFebruary 2023, on a balance of $419. She claims that she is currently financially stable \nand meeting all her monthly expenses. She did not provide any documentation to show \nher current financial position, such as a budget, earned wages, or bank account \ninformation. There is no evidence of financial counseling.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred 20 delinquent debts that remain unpaid. I find both of the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant admitted that her \nfinancial problems were created because she attempted to please her then girlfriend. \nThis is not really a condition beyond her control, but rather a conscious choice she \nmade. Regardless, she failed to present evidence that she acted responsibly in \naddressing her delinquent debts. She presented no evidence of taking any action to \ncontact creditors, set up payment plans, or pay the debts, other than her recent partial \npayment of one SOR debt (SOR \u00b6 1.t). She did not present evidence to support a \ndispute of any of the debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. She failed to \nestablish a track record of financial responsibility. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s relationship with a former girlfriend that caused her \nfinancial distress and her recent credit card payments. However, Applicant failed to \nproduce evidence of any significant action taken to address her delinquent debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

Applicant is 40 years old, unmarried, \nand has no children. He has worked for a defense contractor since January of 2020. \n(Item 3 at pages 7, 13~14 and 27.). \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse & Guideline E: Personal \nConduct \n1.a. and 3.a. Applicant admits to using marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout March of 2000 until June of 2022, a period of about 22 years and ending about 15 \nmonths ago. \n1.b. and 3.a. Applicant admits to purchasing marijuana from about March of 2020 \nuntil October of 2022, a period of about 18 months and ending only about 11 months \nago. \n1.c. and 3.a. Applicant admits to using hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying \nfrequency from about March of 2005 until December of 2020, a period of more than 15 \nyears. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption & Guideline E: Personal Conduct \n2.a. and 3.b. In April of 2002, Applicant was arrested, charged, and subsequently \nfound guilty of Driving Under the Influence (DUI). \n2.b. and 3.b. In October of 2003, 18 months later, Applicant was arrested, \ncharged, and subsequently pled guilty to DUI-Extreme. As a result of this second \nalcohol-related conviction, Applicant was required to attend 40 hours of alcohol \ntreatment, and have an interlock device installed in his vehicle. \n2.c. and 3.b. In February of 2004, only four months later, Applicant was again \narrested, charged, and subsequently pled guilty to DUI-Extreme.

(EVER) been charged with an offense \ninvolving alcohol,\u201d by answering \u201cNo.\u201d I find this to be a willful falsification of a relevant \nquestion about his alcohol use. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia \nAppellant smoked marijuana over two decades, ending in June of 2022. His last \npurchase of marijuana was only 11 months ago. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s long history of drug misuse is too \nrecent to find that it is not of present security significance. The Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse guideline is found against Applicant. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has three alcohol-related incidents between April of 2002 and February \nof 2004. He continues to consume alcohol, to the point of intoxication, on a daily basis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nNeither of these conditions apply. Applicant has a severe drinking problem. \nAlcohol Consumption is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his e-QIP, the following \ndisqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admits his knowing and willful falsification of his November 2020 e-QIP. \nNone of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 apply. Personal Conduct is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For this reason, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns \narising from his drug involvement and substance abuse, alcohol consumption, and \npersonal conduct. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a~2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a~3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all four allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). The four defaulted student loans totaled $22,693. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor assigned to a U.S. Air Force (AF) base as a training - roles manager and hybrid site integrator. He has worked for a DOD contractor since March 2019, and in January 2022, he moved to another state and a new AF base to do essentially the same type of work. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force from 1994 to 2018. He retired at the rank of master sergeant (E-7). His military specialty was surgical technician. He earned an associate degree, and during 2016 to 2018 he attended another university, but he did not graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been married to his wife since 1993, and they have two adult children and a 14-year-old daughter. His wife is employed as a cosmetic sales representative. (Tr. 18- 20, 23; GE 1) Financial Considerations Applicant began to experience financial issues after retiring from the Air Force in 2018. He admitted that he was not good with the transition and the deductions from his pay, which ultimately caused adverse tax consequences. He has resolved all of his delinquent federal tax issues, and he has setup a payment plan with the state tax board for his delinquent 2021 taxes.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F.

I provided Applicant a blank Personal Financial Statement \n(PFS) immediately after the hearing concluded, and I held the record open for two weeks \nin the event either party wanted to supplement the record with that additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted four documents I labeled as AE C, D, E, and F, and I admitted \nall proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. On August 22, 2023, I received a \ncopy of the transcript. (Tr.) The record closed August 30, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all four allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). \nThe four defaulted student loans totaled $22,693. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor assigned to a U.S. Air \nForce (AF) base as a training - roles manager and hybrid site integrator. He has worked \nfor a DOD contractor since March 2019, and in January 2022, he moved to another state \nand a new AF base to do essentially the same type of work. He served honorably in the \nU.S. Air Force from 1994 to 2018. He retired at the rank of master sergeant (E-7). His \nmilitary specialty was surgical technician. He earned an associate degree, and during \n2016 to 2018 he attended another university, but he did not graduate with a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He has been married to his wife since 1993, and they have two adult children \nand a 14-year-old daughter. His wife is employed as a cosmetic sales representative. (Tr. \n18- 20, 23; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant began to experience financial issues after retiring from the Air Force in \n2018. He admitted that he was not good with the transition and the deductions from his \npay, which ultimately caused adverse tax consequences. He has resolved all of his \ndelinquent federal tax issues, and he has setup a payment plan with the state tax board \nfor his delinquent 2021 taxes. He has made approximately eight monthly payments to the \nstate. All of their state and federal tax returns are filed. They have an extension until \nOctober 2023 to file their 2022 tax returns. (Tr. 20-23) \nWhile Applicant attended a university from 2016 to 2018, he told the finance office \nthat he wanted his GI Bill to pay for his tuition, and that he did not want to accrue any type \nof debt.

(Tr. 23-32; SOR response; GE 2) \nAfter Applicant graduated from high school in 1988, he attended other colleges \nuntil 1992. He was fully aware that he had accumulated some student loan debt for those \nspecific years. Although he admitted that he did not owe much tuition for these earlier \nyears of college before enlisting in the military, he had not made any effort to satisfy these \ndelinquent student loans. He never initiated contact with the student loan creditor to \nrequest loan forbearance, loan deferment, consolidation, or loan rehabilitation, but he did \ntell the loan servicer that he was in the military. He stated that years ago he had received \nphone calls and letters requesting payment for these student loan debts. (Tr. 23-32; SOR \nresponse; GE 2) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October 2021 background interview, he told the investigator that \nhe was currently living paycheck to paycheck. Once he got his income under control he \nintended to pay back all of his creditors, but his unpaid taxes were his first priority. He did \nnot disclose the delinquent student loans he accumulated right after high school under \nthe financial section of the 2021 SCA. The four student loans alleged in the SOR are the \ndebts he developed during 2016-2019 while he was still enlisted in the military. He and \nhis wife have completed the Dave Ramsey financial course on two separate occasions \nsince 2015. (Tr. 23-32; SOR response; GE 1, GE 2) \nIn September 2022, Applicant was contacted by a representative of DOHA and \nlearned that his security clearance was still in-process. Applicant was asked to provide \nupdated information to DOHA concerning the status of his defaulted student loans. The \nfirst time the Applicant ever contacted the student loan servicer regarding his delinquent \nstudent loans occurred in about October 2022. He made a phone call to determine how \nhe could get these loans out of default. He said he was able to get the loans rehabilitated \nwithout making payments, and his loans were placed with Nelnet. He was able to set up \na payment plan to begin in October 2023. He also submitted paperwork to have his \nstudent loans considered for debt forgiveness, but he has not yet received a response. \nHe admitted that over all these years he has never made a single payment on his \ndelinquent student loans. The record does not show that his student loans had been \nrehabilitated. (Tr. 33-34; SOR response, AE A, AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent student loan with the U.S. Department of Education \nin the amount of $7,891.

This student loan debt relief \nreceived several extensions. In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the \nPresident directed the DoED to place federal student loans in forbearance. The federal \ngovernment repeatedly extended the student loan payment pause. The pause includes \nthe following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% \ninterest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) \nwebsite, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. (HE 2) On February 25, \n2023, the FSA website said: \nThe student loan payment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of \nEducation is permitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation \nis resolved. Payments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program \nhas not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June \n30, 2023 \u2014 payments will resume 60 days after that. We will notify \nborrowers before payments restart.  \nIn August 2022, President Biden announced forgiveness of $10,000 or $20,000 of \nfederal student loan debt, and on November 11, 2022, the DoED said they would continue \nto seek forgiveness of student loans.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent student loans totaling approximately $22,693. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe only delinquent debts Applicant have at this time are his four federal student \nloans totaling $22,693. He makes a six-figure income, and he has been continuously \nemployed since 2019. He was placed on notice when he filled out his SCA in February \n2021 that a security clearance holder\u2019s financial history was of security concern to the \ngovernment. In October 2021, he was confronted by the DOD authorized investigator \nabout his delinquent student loans. He answered interrogatories in October 2022, and he \nreceived his SOR in December 2022. He had plenty of opportunities to take responsible \naction to begin repaying or rehabilitating his delinquent loans. Applicant did not initiate \ncontact with the DoED until only after he had been contacted by DOHA in September \n2022 requesting that he provide updated information on his defaulted student loans. \nBased on the current PFS, Applicant\u2019s net (emphasis added) annual salary totals \nabout $129,192. Even with the student loan monthly payment included in the PFS, he \nhad a monthly net remainder of $5,111. Applicant\u2019s four delinquent federal student loans \nare currently deferred under the CARES Act. Although his student loans are currently in \na deferment status, it is important to note that he has not made any payments to this \ncreditor, which caused them to go in default before the CARES Act was enacted and \nwhile he was gainfully employed. Applicant stated that he intends to make student loan \npayments beginning in October 2023, but he has not established a steady track record of \npayments even though he certainly has the financial resources to do so. As of the date of \nthe hearing, he had never made a student loan payment willingly. The timing of his actions \nto address his defaulted student loans does not demonstrate he initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay these creditors until his security clearance was in peril. \nIt is well-established that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration \nfor a judge to deliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmanner in addressing financial problems. For example, to receive full credit under \nMitigating Condition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant\u2019s recent actions to resolve his delinquent student loans only after he learned \nhis security clearance was in peril do not receive this mitigating credit. \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. I find that repaying student loan creditors has \nnot been a priority for Applicant, especially when taking into account his annual income \nand his monthly net remainder of over $5,000 after paying his monthly expenses. In the \ncontext of his security eligibility, I find that Applicant did not act responsibly by failing to \naddress his delinquent student loans earlier. Applicant\u2019s actions under these \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Guideline F security concerns have not been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. I considered his \nage, length of employment, honorable military service, and his recent actions to \nrehabilitate his student loan and set-up a payment plan, which although occurred rather \nlate at this juncture, it is still a step in the right direction. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

Even before 2021, Applicant has shown little voluntary effort to \naddress his older defaulted student loans. Considering the lack of evidence of good-faith \nefforts to responsibly resolve these accounts, his financial history raises unmitigated \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He has held a security \nclearance since 2016. (Tr. 22-24, 34, 37, 47; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from about 2008 to about 2013, and \nfrom about September 2020 to at least December 2021; and that he used marijuana \nfrom about September 2020 to least December 2021, while granted access to classified \ninformation.

(GE 1-3; SOR answer) \nApplicant started using marijuana in 2008 when he was 17 or 18 years old. He \nused marijuana approximately 400 times between 2008 and 2013. Use of marijuana \nwas illegal under state law where Applicant resided until 2012. He claimed to have \nstopped using marijuana in 2013 because it no longer fit his lifestyle. He began working \nfor his current employer in 2014 and shortly thereafter completed his first SCA. He \nadmitted his earlier use of marijuana in his 2014 SCA. He was granted a security \nclearance in 2016. He worked on a classified project from 2016 through approximately \n2020, when he no longer worked on that project. He claimed that he did not use \nmarijuana during this time period. He was advised by his work supervisor not to start \nusing marijuana now that he was no longer working on a classified project. (Tr. 24-25, \n31-32, 35-36, 41, 57; GE 2) \nApplicant resumed using marijuana in approximately September 2020. He \ncontinued his use through approximately December 2021. He testified that he used \nmarijuana one to three times a week. He used marijuana with his then-girlfriend, with \nwhom he no longer associates.

He admitted knowing his employer\u2019s drug policy, \nwhich prohibited using marijuana. He was told by his employer in 2021 that it wanted \nhim on another classified project. He was required to fill out another SCA in May 2021 \nand undergo a background interview in June and July 2021. He admitted using \nmarijuana after undergoing these security clearance activities. (Tr. 25-26, 33, 38-39, 42, \n44, 47, 49; GE 2) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant asserted that he would not use marijuana in the \nfuture. He denied that he was dependent on marijuana. He offered evidence that on four \noccasions between October 2022 and February 2023, he provided urine samples that \ntested negative for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. He \nbegan seeing a therapist in June 2022. He sees her weekly. She testified that they have \nworked on how Applicant can better cope with anxiety and stress. She uses Cognitive \nBehavior Therapy as a tool to address these topics and to decrease his desire to use \nmarijuana. She has seen improvements in him. Applicant also presented a self-\nadministrated form for alcohol or drug abuse. While the assessment put Applicant at the \nrisk level of \u201cNone to Low,\u201d I gave little weight to this assessment because all the \ninformation is provided by Applicant in response to \u201cyes and no\u201d questions. (Tr. 27, 30, \n42-43, 50, 61-66; AE A-B) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor, who worked with him on a classified project from \n2016 to 2020, testified for him and offered a written statement of support. He stated that \nApplicant is an excellent engineer and is a trustworthy person. He is the supervisor who \nwarned Applicant not to use marijuana after concluding his work on the classified \nproject in 2020. He is also aware of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use after 2020 but believes \nhe has learned from the experience and recommends him for a clearance. Applicant \npresented several years\u2019 worth of performance appraisals where he was rated as \n\u201cexceeded or significantly exceeded\u201d expectations.\u201d (Tr. 52-57; AE C-D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana at various times between 2008 and 2013, and at \nvarious times from September 2020 to December 2021. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2016, but he clarified in his \ntestimony that he did not have access to classified information when he used marijuana \nexcept from November 2021 to December 2021. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation and the granting of access to classified information are not synonymous \nconcepts. They are separate determinations. The issuance of a security clearance is a \ndetermination that an individual is eligible for access to classified national security \ninformation up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an \nindividual access to classified materials. In order to gain access to specific classified \nmaterials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also \nmust have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). AG \u00b6 25(f) applies to the period of \nNovember 2021 to December 2021. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s intermittent use of marijuana, which goes back to 2008, with \nnumerous uses after he held a security clearance, casts doubt on his current reliability, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His most recent use came after he completed his \nsecond SCA and background investigation, after his supervisor specifically warned him \nnot to use marijuana, and with full knowledge of his employer\u2019s prohibition against the \nuse of illegal drugs, including marijuana. He discontinued his association with his ex-\ngirlfriend with whom he used marijuana, and he expressed his intent not to use \nmarijuana in the future. However, he failed to establish a sufficient period of abstinence \nconsidering his history of resuming marijuana use after an extensive period of \nabstinence (2013 to 2020). None of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s years of \ncontractor employment, his supervisor\u2019s recommendation, his therapist\u2019s testimony, and \nhis excellent employment record. However, I also considered that he used marijuana \nmultiple times, and as recently as December 2021, while holding a security clearance \neven though he knew such behavior was incompatible with holding a security clearance. \nHis frequent and recent marijuana use, while holding a security clearance, \ndemonstrates that he does not possess the reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment to hold a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nAgainst Applicant (substituting \nNovember 2021 for September \n2021) \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His first sergeant ordered Applicant to take a \nbreathalyzer test, which showed a blood alcohol content of .08 ml. Applicant later \nadmitted to his treating doctor that he drank a gallon of rum, followed by another fifth of \na gallon of rum over the weekend before his Monday duty day. Based upon Applicant\u2019s, \nblood alcohol content, his commander punished him under Article 15 of the UCMJ for \nbeing drunk on duty. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to restriction and extra \nduties for 45 days and a reduction in grade from E-5 to E-4.

He began this program in March or April 2019. Applicant \ndescribed the program as him attending group counseling sessions two times a week, \nalcohol testing once a week, and individual counseling once a month. He was required \nto abstain from alcohol in order to successfully complete the program. His counselor \nwas a licensed mental health counselor (LMHC). According to Applicant\u2019s treatment \nrecords he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. The records also indicated \nthat Applicant admitted using alcohol on several occasions while in the program. He \nused alcohol on April 26, 2019. He admitted this use in a group session. He admitted \nusing alcohol again on June 8, 2019, during a group session. In approximately July \n2019, Applicant reported to his dietician that he was consuming a pint of liquor every \nworkday and even more on the weekends. Records also show that he reported \nconsuming alcohol in June and July 2019.

In his SOR answer, he stated that the day following the news about\nhis father, he had less than one drink while alone in his barracks room on an off-duty\nweekend. In his hearing testimony, he stated he bought a pint of rum and drank about\nhalf of it before his first sergeant showed up at his room. His first sergeant suspected\nthat he had been drinking alcohol and took him to the hospital to have his blood drawn.\nApplicant acknowledged that event, but denied being intoxicated and to the contrary\naverred that his first sergeant was intoxicated. There is no information in the record\nconcerning the result of this blood test or the amount of alcohol consumed. Applicant\nwas discharged from the Army less than a month later. The basis for his discharge, as\nnoted on his discharge certificate (DD-214) was Army Regulation (AR) 635-200,\nChapter 9, which is titled \u201cAlcohol or Other Drug Rehabilitation Failure.\u201d (Tr. 37-39, 41-\n42; SOR Answer, See AE B; GE 2, pp. 6-7) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant Continues to Consume Alcohol Against Treatment Advice and \nRecommendations. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview with an investigator, in November 2020, \nhe stated he no longer drinks alcohol. In his answers to DOHA interrogatories in July \n2021, he stated he drinks two beers weekly, with his last consumption being on July 16, \n2021. He further stated he did not intend to continue that rate of consumption. He also \nindicated that he becomes intoxicated when drinking three beers. The last time he was \nintoxicated was December 2019. He also answered that he never consumed alcoholic \nbeverages before going to work, failing to list the February 2019 incident when he was \ncharged with being drunk on duty and which led to his inpatient alcohol treatment. (GE \n2, p. 7; GE 3, pp. 3-4) \nBefore Applicant was disqualified from the SUDCC program, it was \nrecommended that he continue group counseling and forego use of any alcohol \n(substance). His discharge treatment plan included as an objective, \u201cabstain from \nalcohol.\u201d (GE 8, p. 5; GE 11, p.5; GE 12, p.5) \nApplicant currently drinks alcohol on his nonwork days and he also abstains from \nalcohol the day before his first work day of the week. He drinks approximately four to \nfive vodka drinks per occasion. He claims to only drink at home, never out in public. He \nclaims he does not drink to intoxication, but the last time he was intoxicated was in \nDecember 2022, when he was at a friend\u2019s house celebrating their birthdays, which fall \non the same day. He claims he had no alcohol incidents before the Army and none after \nhis discharge from the Army. He claims that alcohol is not important to his life. He has \nnot seen a counselor about his alcohol use since he left the Army in October 2019. He \nhas not attended any Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings since leaving the Army. \nApplicant stated that alcohol has no meaning in his life, but he also stated that he \nenjoys drinking alcohol because it takes the edge off of things. He submitted a written \nletter of intent to \u201ccontinue my modification of alcohol consumption.\u201d He also stated that \nif he chooses to drink alcohol, he will do it in a responsible manner. He owns his own \nhome where he is the sole occupant. (Tr. 45, 47-49, 69, 71, 73-74; SOR answer, See \nAE D) \nAfter considering all of Applicant\u2019s prior statements during his inpatient and \noutpatient treatment, as well as his statement to his background investigator, there are \nsignificant inconsistency between those statements and his hearing testimony. Overall, I \ndid not find his testimony credible. \nCharacter and Possible Mitigation Evidence. \nApplicant presented eight character letters from supervisors, colleagues and \nfriends. They describe Applicant as responsible and someone who is dedicated, hard-\nworking, trustworthy, and who has high character. Several recommend continuation of \nhis security clearance.

(SOR \nanswer, See AE A, E-F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;   \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s excessive drinking while in the Army, which resulted in disciplinary \naction for being drunk on duty, his participation in both inpatient and outpatient alcohol \ntreatment programs, and his failure to successfully complete his outpatient program, led \nto his discharge from the Army. Additionally, he was diagnosed by qualified medical \nprofessionals with alcohol use disorder and he failed to follow treatment advice and \nrecommendations. The described record evidence supports the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions, except as they relate to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Participation in alcohol \ntreatment as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a does not establish a disqualifying condition. \nAdditionally, there was no evidence of the specific amount consumed by Applicant as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and the evidence indicated this event occurred in September \n2019, not July 2019, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. For these reason, I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.e is \nmaterially defective and find in favor of Applicant on that allegation. Having said that, \nthe evidence does establish that Applicant consumed some amount of alcohol in \napproximately September 2019. This was his final alcohol-related action that culminated \nin his discharge from the Army for failure to complete his alcohol treatment program. I \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwill use this evidence as it may relate to credibility, mitigation, and the whole-person \nfactors. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption under \nAG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s last adverse alcohol incident occurred in 2019. This might be \nconsidered attenuated by time, but he continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis, \nwhich is contrary to his treatment recommendations. He claims he has modified his \ndrinking pattern, however, his history of excessive drinking and his lack of credibility \nwhen describing his drinking patterns cause me to question the veracity of his claim. His \nactions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant claims that he will drink alcohol responsibly in the future. His past \nhistory indicates otherwise. His treating physician during his inpatient treatment noted \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cquestionable commitment to sobriety.\u201d He failed to complete his outpatient \ntreatment because he continued to consume alcohol. Since he left the Army, he has not \nsought counseling for his alcohol use, or attended any AA meetings. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and \n23(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, his contractor service, his letters of recommendation, and his appraisals and \ncertifications. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d, 1.f-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.e \n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 7.) \nThe Answer \nBefore addressing each SOR debt, Applicant stated: \u201cI do not recall all of the \naccounts noted below but do acknowledge I fell behind on some credit card payments \ndue to the loss of relationship in which we shared expenses and found I could not maintain \nall of my payments.\u201d She gave no basic details about when that loss occurred. (Answer.) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,709), claiming she has requested proof of \nindebtedness and \u201cwill proceed accordingly when the documentation is received.\u201d Her \nresponse cited a March 6, 2023 letter from creditor\u2019s counsel requesting a resolution \nagreement. (Answer.) She did not provide documents evidencing her request for proof of \nindebtedness or a copy of the March 6, 2023 letter she referenced. \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c ($9,551), claiming this debt is now paid due to wage \ngarnishment from August 2022 through March 10, 2023. (Answer.) The most current \ncredit report in the record is April 26, 2023, which may have been too recent to capture a \nsatisfaction through garnishment. That credit report does not show this debt. (Item 4.) \nShe provided no documents evidencing a garnishment or a satisfaction of this debt. \nApplicant denied the remaining five SOR debts. Those denials have the following \ncommon themes.

She provided no documents evidencing her attempts to \nobtain information from her creditors or collection agencies about her overdue accounts, \nor their responses \nThe PSI \nDuring Applicant\u2019s March 7, 2022 PSI, she discussed her SOR debts. (Item 7 at 2-\n5.) SOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card account she opened in September 2015. She did not charge \nanything on that card until October 2016, when she used it for a vacation. She made \nregular monthly payments. It became delinquent in about June 2020, when she became \nunable to make minimum monthly payments. She does not dispute the information in the \ncredit report. She plans to contact the creditor and try to negotiate a monthly payment \nplan when she is able to do so .(Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant discussed the circumstances that caused her financial problems. Her \nfinancial situation began to change, after a storm inflicted significant damage to her home \nin 2016. Only a part of the damage was covered by her homeowner\u2019s insurance. She had \nto pay about $12,000 to replace a leaking roof; $3,000 for replacing interior carpeting; \nreplacing and painting a deck; and updating appliances. She had to use credit cards to \npay her bills. Initially, she managed to juggle her finances to stay afloat, but over time, \nher financial situation became worse. (Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant discussed her plans to resolve her financial problems. She is already in \nthe process of putting her home on the market, and she expected it to be listed by April \n2022. After the home is sold, she plans to move in with her daughter. (Note: There is no \nreference in the record to her having a daughter.) She currently owes $43,000 on her \nmortgage. An online estimate of the value of her home was $140,000. The balance on \nher auto loan is $1,000, which will be paid off in six months. She will use the profit from \nthe sale of her home to pay off her delinquent debts. (Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant discussed the other six SOR debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g. These \naccounts are all credit cards. Her discussions of those accounts shared certain features. \nFirst, she does not dispute any of the information in the credit reports, even though she \ncould not recall details of many of the accounts. Second, the delinquencies occurred in \nabout the 2016 to 2020 timeframe. Third, the accounts became delinquent when she \ncould no longer make the minimum monthly payments. Fourth, she plans to contact the \ncreditors to attempt to negotiate monthly payment plans. Some of those plans may have \nto wait until she has sold her home. She did not provide any documents about the seven \ndelinquent accounts. (Item 7 at 2-5.) \nIn a follow-up PSI, Applicant discussed her current financial situation. Her gross \nmonthly income is $6,651, with total payroll deductions of $2,049, leaving a monthly net \nsalary of $4,602. Her basic monthly expenses are $2,430 (food, clothing, utilities, car, \netc.). Her monthly debt payments (including mortgage of $580) total $1,435. Her monthly \nnet remainder is $737.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by her admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). In her Answer, Applicant refers \nto \u201cthe loss of a relationship\u201d where she shared expenses but could not maintain her \npayments when that relationship ended. That event is not mentioned any further in her \nAnswer, the PSI, or anywhere else in the record. More credibly, it seems that her financial \nwoes stemmed from storm damage she suffered in 2016. That is quite a while ago, but \nher indebtedness persists to this day. That is, it is recurring. Her debts are not mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two requirements. \nFirst, the conditions causing financial problems must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s control. Second, she must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse \ncircumstances she confronted. \nIn her PSI, Applicant went into credible detail about the damage the 2016 storm \nwreaked on her home. She detailed $15,000 of damage alone for a leaking roof and \ninterior carpeting. That is a significant amount. She also explained how she initially used \ncredit cards to keep herself afloat to pay for uninsured losses. At some point, however, \nher juggling of finances worsened to the point where she could no longer manage them. \nI find that the circumstances that caused her financial problems were \u201clargely beyond\u201d her \ncontrol. She satisfied the first requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe next inquiry under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant acted responsibly in \nconfronting the adverse circumstances she faced. In her PSI, she did not dispute the SOR \ndebts reported in her credit reports. Her plan at that time was to contact each creditor for \ndetails and attempt some form of resolution. Her plan was to put her home up for sale, \nmove in with a family member, and use the expected profits from the sale of her home to \npay her delinquent debts. She was candid enough to note that one or more of those \nresolutions might have to await the sale of her home. That was a reasonable plan. \nThe problem is that in her Answer, a year after her PSI, she expressed the same \nplan, but she provided no evidence that she had taken any steps towards achieving that \nplan. She produced no evidence of her contacts with her creditors, no evidence that she \nhad placed her home on the market, no responses (even negative ones) from her \ncreditors about her reaching out to them. In short, on this record her plan of a year earlier \nremains just that, a plan. The Appeal Board respects an applicant\u2019s reasonable plan to \nresolve debts. The Board also expects an applicant to have taken some steps towards \nthe execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 3 (App. Bd. May 3, \n2011). Here, Applicant has taken no such steps, She has not, therefore, acted responsibly \nas required by AG \u00b6 20(b). Therefore, her SOR debts have not been mitigated. By the \nsame reasoning, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The record did not indicate that he participated in credit \ncounseling through the debt relief company, or otherwise. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred numerous debts in recent years. The debts are established by \nthe credit reports in the record and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant\u2019s debts are largely ongoing and unresolved. They continue to cast doubt \non his current reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant asserted that many of his delinquent debts occurred when he was the \nsole income earner in his household, due to the instability of his wife\u2019s employment. But \nHowever, for full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also show that his subsequent \nactions are reasonable under the circumstances. Applicant provided no details about his \nefforts to resolve his debts. He did not establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should apply.  \nFor similar reasons, Applicant did not establish that he has undertaken a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his debts, typically by establishing a track record of steady \npayments towards his creditors (through the debt relief company, or otherwise). He did \nnot establish that AG \u00b6 20(d) should apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply, as Applicant did not show that he has participated in \ncredit counseling or that his debts are being resolved or are under control. As to the \ndebts he denied, Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to support his \nassertions that he is not responsible for them. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Given the limited documentation in this case, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, even if they \noccurred due to a decline in household income. Since Applicant requested a decision on \nthe written record, I did not have the opportunity to question him in a hearing about the \nstatus of his SOR debts, to better assess the reasonableness of his actions in addressing \nthem. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. This does not mean that at a later date he cannot \nestablish that he is taking reasonable steps to resolve his debts, but at this time, he has \nnot shown that he has done enough to mitigate the financial security concerns arising \nunder due to his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2007. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married, and has no children. (TR at page 5 line 13 to page 6 line 6, at page 15 lines 1~20, and GX 1 at pages 7, 10, 11, 15 and 17.)

Applicant admits two past-due debts to Creditor A in amounts of \n$6,253 and $3,747. He has submitted nothing further regarding the $6,200 debt, but \nclaims to have recently paid the $3,700 debt. (TR at page 16 line 7 to page 20 line 25, \nand at page 22 line 20 to page 23 line 21.) As both debts still appear as past-due on the \nGovernment\u2019s most recent March 2023 credit report, I find these two debts totaling \n$10,000 are still past due. (GX 5 at pages 5 and 6.) \n1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about \n$3,774, but claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 21 line 2 to page 22 line \n19.) The only document Applicant submits in this regard shows an outstanding \njudgment of $4,472. (AppX A.) I find this increased debt is still past due. \n1.d. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor D in the amount of about \n$3,355, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. I find this debt is still past-due. \n1.e. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor E in the amount of about \n$3,287, and submits documentation showing that he has recently set up a payment plan \nto address this admitted debt. (TR at page 23 line 22 to page 25 line 5, AppX B.) As \nApplicant has submitted nothing further in this regard, such as documents showing \npayments pursuant to his payment plan, I find this debt is still past due. \n1.f. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of about $2,483, \nbut claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 25 lines 6~21.)

(GX 3 at page 4.) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has past-due debts totaling over $23,000. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has history \nof delinquencies going back to 2017. Applicant has not demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Tr. at 41-48, 53-56; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2-4; AE C-E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts and financial problems. The evidence \nindicates that it was initially difficult for him to pay his debts, but he reached a point \nwhere he could pay at least some of his debts, but he just chose not to. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(b), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems related to his separation, divorce, paying to \nmaintain households in two states, alimony, and child support. His separation and \ndivorce qualify as conditions that were largely beyond his control. To receive the full \nbenefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also prove that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nI am giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt on the $16,552 charged-off auto \nloan that he cosigned for his cousin (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and the disputed $410 debt to a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncollection company on behalf of a home security company (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Those debts are \nmitigated. \nApplicant has not paid any of the other SOR debts, and he does not intend to, as \nhe is waiting for them to age off his credit report. The fact that a debt no longer appears \non a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the \ndisposition of the debt. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015) \nand ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). He stated that three of the \ncredit union debts were cancelled through the issuance of an IRS Form 1099-C, but he \ndid not provide copies of the IRS forms nor of his income tax returns that would have \nincluded that information. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge \nto expect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. \n04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and \nongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to \neliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and particularly his four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHowever, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered \nfor national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts and filed for bankruptcy protection. He did \nnot file his 2018 and 2019 federal and state income tax returns. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s medical condition that left \nher unable to work. Bankruptcy was a reasonable response to those issues. The \nbankruptcy, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1(c), is mitigated. \nApplicant has still not filed his 2018 and 2019 federal and state income tax \nreturns. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \ntheir legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. \nApplicant claimed that he could not afford to have someone prepare his returns. \nHowever, his wife filed her 2018 tax returns, and he was supposed to go with her to \nhave his returns completed at the same time, but he did not go. I do not accept that in \nfour years Applicant could not make arrangements to file his returns. There are no \nmitigating conditions applicable to the unfiled returns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He had a signature loan, a credit-card debt, and two vehicle loans, respectively. \n(Tr. 29) The two vehicles with liens from the creditor were returned to the creditor at one \nof their branch locations in a Middle Eastern country in 2015. (Tr. 32, 61-64) He was \nunaware of what the credit union employees did with the two vehicles. The vehicle debts \nwere SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, and he believed the creditor did not give him a credit for the \nreturn of the vehicles. (Tr. 32-34, 62-63) \nWhen he was unable to make payments to the credit union because of his reduced \nsalary, he contacted the creditor, and he received a one-month forbearance. (Tr. 29; AE \nA) He defaulted on the loans in April 2015. (Tr. 26-27, 60; AE A) He repeatedly contacted \nthe creditor over the years, and the creditor\u2019s best offer is for him to pay 45 percent of the \ndebt over a two-year period. (Tr. 29; AE A) He asked the creditor to credit him with \nreturning the two vehicles; however, the creditor refused to do so. (Tr. 34) The monthly \npayments would be $2,400 for a total of about $55,000. (Tr. 29) He provided a copy of \nhis correspondence with the creditor. (Tr. 30; AE A) He was unable to afford the $2,400 \nmonthly payments. (Tr. 30)  \nApplicant most recently communicated with the creditor six weeks before his \nhearing, and the creditor\u2019s offer continued to be to settle the debt for 45 percent of the \nface amount by making payments over 24 months. (Tr. 54) The four debts are not \naccruing interest. (Tr. 55, 67) He has currently saved $4,000 to pay the creditor. (Tr. 55) \nOnce he has a larger amount available, he plans to offer the creditor an initial lump-sum \npayment and then to make payments under a more realistic payment plan. (Tr. 66) In his \nSCA and response to interrogatories, he noted the four debts were collection-barred by \nthe statute of limitations and had aged off or been dropped from his credit report.

(Tr. 36, 43) He believed \nhe was not required to file a State A income tax return or pay taxes to State A because \nhe did not consider himself to be a resident of State A. (Tr. 36-37) He did not do anything \nto establish residence in a tax-free state until he left the Middle Eastern country, and he \nreturned to the United States in 2018.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

May 2, 1996). \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

SOR \u00b6 20(b) is established. \nApplicant indicated several of his SOR debts were dropped from his credit report. \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence \nof debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nIn his SCA and response to interrogatories, Applicant noted the four debts were \ncollection-barred by the statute of limitations and had aged off or been dropped from his \ncredit report. However, he is not relying on the statute of limitations to avoid paying the \nfour debts. An explanation of the relationship between state statutes of limitations and \nsecurity concerns is helpful. \nState statutes of limitations for various types of debts range from 2 to 15 years. \nSee Nolo Law for All website, Chart: Statutes of Limitations in All 50 States, \nhttp://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-\n29941.html. It is illegal under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for a creditor to \nthreaten to sue to collect a time-barred debt. See Federal Trade Commission website, \n\u201cDebt Collection FAQs,\u201d http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0117-time-barred-debts. \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value \nof application of the statute of limitations: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \nthey stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving \nsecurity and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration \nunderlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and \nachieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will \nnot be [haled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of \nlimitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. \nCt. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Carolina case law \nis not binding on state courts in other states. However, the South Carolina Court of \nAppeals\u2019 description of the basis for this long-standing legal doctrine is instructive. See \nalso Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988) \n(where the U.S. Supreme Court noted that \u201cThe State\u2019s interest in a self-executing statute \nof limitations is in providing repose for potential defendants and in avoiding stale claims.\u201d). \nA state statute of limitations may be tolled when the debtor is outside the United States, \nor it may restart under some circumstances. \nOnce Applicant stopped making payments, the creditor had to file suit within the \nstatute of limitations to maintain the collectability of their debt. There is no evidence that \nthe creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, or 1.e took judicial action to pursue collection of \nthese four debts. Assuming but not deciding that these four SOR debts are collection \nbarred, they are still relevant to financial considerations security concerns: \nApplicant\u2019s argument concerning the unenforceability of the largest debt \ndue to the running of the statute of limitations fails to demonstrate the Judge \nerred. First, security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by \nstatutes of limitations. Second, absent an explicit act of Congress to the \ncontrary, the Federal Government is not bound by state law in carrying out \nits functions and responsibilities. Applicant does not cite to any Federal \nstatute that requires the Federal Government to be bound by state law in \nmaking security clearance decisions. Third, a security clearance \nadjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable under state law, has been discharged in a \nbankruptcy, or is paid, the Federal Government is entitled to consider the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and \nfailing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). In this case, the Judge\u2019s consideration \nof the unenforceable debt in making her security clearance eligibility \ndetermination was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board has \u201cheld that \nreliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties and is of limited mitigative value.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. \nBd.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01122 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009) \n(reversing grant of security clearance); ADP Case No. 06-14616 (App. Bd.

It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicants are not required \u201cto \nbe debt-free in order to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that \nan applicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017) (denial of security clearance remanded) (citing ISCR Case No.13-00987 at 3, n. 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on \nall delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in \nthe SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant paid or settled all of the SOR debts except the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, and 1.e. He promised to expeditiously resolve the last four debts. He acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and ability to \nprotect classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply. Security concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nThe rationale for approving Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial than the \nreasons for denying his clearance. Applicant is a 44-year-old program manager. His \nresume provides details about his professional experiences and accomplishments. He \nwas promoted from deputy program manager to program manager in April 2022. He has \nheld a security clearance since 2004, and there is no evidence of security violations, \nalcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for 18 months described him as the top person he \nsupervised out of 114 employees. He has outstanding integrity, honesty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. If his supervisor was starting a new company, Applicant is the first person \nhe would hire. He received performance awards, completed courses, received certificates \nof achievement, and accomplished several certifications. His letters of recommendation \nlaud his diligence and professionalism. He has excellent performance evaluations. He \nvolunteers in his community. He is dedicated to his company, community, and family. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. His debts resulted from \ndivorce in 2014, unemployment in 2024, and underemployment in 2015 to 2018. He made \na good-faith mistake when he assumed he had changed his state of residence for state \nincome tax purposes while he was living in the Middle East; however, he failed to establish \nconnections to his new state of residence. He realized his financial mistakes; he took \ncorrective actions; and he assured that he will continue to endeavor to maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. \nThe remaining four SOR debts are owed to the same creditor, who is seeking \n$2,400 monthly payments for 24 months. Applicant believed he was unable to make these\nmonthly payments because of his other financial responsibilities. He is saving about\n$1,000 monthly to accumulate enough money to settle or negotiate a more reasonable\npayment plan. All of the other SOR debts are resolved. I am confident he will maintain his\nfinancial responsibility. He understands that he needs to pay his debts, and the conduct\nrequired to retain his security clearance. He was sincere and credible at his hearing. His\nefforts at debt resolution are shown in his October 20, 2022 credit report, which reflects\n10 accounts in \u201cPays as agreed status,\u201d and one paid charged-off account with a zero\nbalance. He has made the necessary efforts at debt resolution and establishment of his\nfinancial responsibility. He has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-\npayment. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). I am confident\nhe will maintain his financial responsibility. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nApplicant is advised that the grant of a security clearance now does not mean the \nGovernment is unable to check his credit and the status of his debts in the future. He may \nbe required to show documented resolution of the four unresolved debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. A broken promise to pay debts made during a security clearance hearing \ncan have adverse consequences in a future security clearance adjudication. It is \nimperative that he continue his efforts to resolve these four debts, and that he maintain \nhis financial responsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to overcome the \nDorfmont presumption. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. \n10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used marijuana, cocaine, psilocybin mushrooms, ecstasy, and \nketamine, with varying frequency from about 2015 to 2022, a period of about seven \nyears. He also cultivated psilocybin mushrooms. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s drug abuse ceased only seven months prior to \nthe issuance of the SOR, and only a month prior to him executing his e-QIP. It is too \nsoon to say that Applicant drug involvement and substance misuse will not reoccur. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well thought of in the workplace and \nin his community. (Answer at pages 7 and 8.) However, it is too soon to say that \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse will not reoccur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. However, this should not \ndissuade Applicant from applying for a security clearance in the future, following a \nlonger period of abstinence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant is a long-time \nrecreational marijuana user. He intends to use the drug in the future. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 23, 2022, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. This \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; \nas well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant's security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted \nto an administrative judge for a determination whether to deny his security clearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 2) The Government submitted its written case on March 6, \n2023. Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material on March 14, \n2023. In the FORM, the Government informed Applicant that it was offering a summary \nof his January 2022 subject interview with a background investigator into evidence. The \nGovernment advised him of his ability to object to, correct, add, delete, or update the \ninformation in the subject interview summary. The Government further advised him that \nfailure to respond could result in a determination by the administrative judge that he \nwaived any objection to the document\u2019s admissibility. He did not respond. Accordingly, \nthe documents appended to the FORM, including the summary, are admitted as GE 1 \nthrough 4, without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 44, has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, since December \n2021, in an information technology position. He submitted a security clearance \napplication, his first, also in December 2021. He disclosed a history of marijuana use and \nhis intent to continue using the drug. He confirmed these disclosures in a January 2022 \nsubject interview with a background investigator. He also admitted to purchasing the drug. \nThe SOR alleges these facts as disqualifying under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. He admitted the allegation, SOR \u00b6 1.a, without explanation. (GE 2-4) \nOn his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he began using \nmarijuana recreationally in May 1999 and that his use was ongoing at the time he\ncompleted the application. He reported using the drug \u201ca few times a month.\u201d He also \ndisclosed that he intended use the drug in the future as doing so \u201cdoesn\u2019t cause any \nproblems in my life or relationships.\u201d In his subject interview he admitted to using the drug \nalmost every weekend. He uses the drug alone and in social settings with friends. (GE 3-\n4) \n \nApplicant lives in a state where marijuana use is legal, and the drug can be \npurchased at state-sanctioned dispensaries. He has purchased marijuana from \ndispensaries as well as from a friend who grows the drug in his home. (GE 3-4) \nAccording to Applicant, everyone he knows is aware of his marijuana use, and it \ncannot be used a source of blackmail or exploitation. (GE 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nApplicant admits to recreational marijuana use for more than 20 years and that he \nwill continue to use the drug in the future. The illegal use of controlled substances can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because such \nbehavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. (AG \u00b6 25) The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 26(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the guideline\u2019s mitigating conditions apply. The legalization of marijuana \nuse or purchase from state-sanctioned dispensaries in Applicant\u2019s state of residency does \nnot alter federal law or existing National Security Guidelines. No state can authorize the \nviolation of federal law. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use violates the Controlled Substances Act, \nwhich identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Under the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, federal agencies remain prohibited \nfrom granting a security clearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance. (See \nDirector of National Intelligence Memorandum, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use, dated November 17, 2014). The Agency clarified its guidance concerning \nmarijuana for individuals eligible to access classified information in a memorandum dated \nDecember 21, 2021: \nWith regard to the first topic, agencies are instructed that prior recreational \nmarijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative. The [Security Executive Agent (SecEA)] has provided \ndirection in SEAD 4 to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person \nconcept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has \nbeen mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable \nadjudicative determination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not limited \nto, frequency of use and. whether the individual can demonstrate that future \nuse is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or other such \nappropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing- federal law \nand policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position \nor holding a security clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise \nprospective national security workforce employees that they should refrain \nfrom any future marijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting \nprocess, which commences once the individual signs the certification \ncontained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions. \nGiven his intent to continue using the drug, Applicant has not mitigated the alleged \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-person Concept \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security worthiness. \nThis decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts under the whole-person \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of persuasion and \nproduction to mitigate the alleged concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in June 1996. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1996 and was honorably discharged in 2015. He married in 2019 and has no children. After separating from the Navy, Applicant worked for a government contractor from September 2017 to December 2020. Since January 2021, he has been employed by a different government contractor as a senior data link analyst. He has held a DOD security clearance since 2011. The SOR alleges four delinquent accounts totaling $20,719. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all four of the delinquent accounts. He provided no further information about the circumstances that triggered these delinquencies nor his efforts to resolve them. (Item 1) During his November 19, 2021 background interview, Applicant discussed the four delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. He did not list them on his September 2021 security clearance application, as required, due to oversight. He explained that these accounts became delinquent for several reasons: he had forgotten about paying them; he had not received any statements; he was immature; he was unmotivated to pay; he had used credit cards to pay for his wedding and honeymoon; financially he \u201cwas in over his head\u201d; he had other bills that took priority; and he had insufficient income to pay off these accounts. He told the investigator that he recently received a raise at work and planned to use the additional income to pay these four delinquent accounts.",

He did not make any payments on the other two delinquent debts. He did not \ntake responsible action to address his financial obligations until his security clearance \nwas in peril, and he still has unresolved delinquent debt. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 13, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). The CAF took action \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn December 22, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR. He admitted all four \nalleged delinquent accounts, without any further explanation or documentation in support \nof mitigation or extenuation. He requested a determination on the written record, in lieu \nof a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative \njudge.

Department Counsel\u2019s FORM \nincludes Items 1 through 6. Item 3 is the summary of an interview with an investigator \nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducted in March 2020. The FORM \nincludes a notice to Applicant informing him of his opportunity to make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates to the interview summary or to object to the admissibility \nof Item 3. The notice further informs Applicant that if he does not raise an objection or \nrespond to the FORM, a DOHA administrative judge may determine that he has waived \nany objections to the admissibility of the summaries. \nOn February 20, 2023, Applicant received the FORM and its attachments. He \ntimely submitted documentation I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, there were \nno objections, and all proffered documents were admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on June 1, 2023. On July 17, 2023, I requested Department Counsel \nprovide a current credit report, and I requested that Applicant provide evidence of his \npayments and other relevant documentation. I held the record open until July 24, 2023. \nDepartment Counsel submitted a credit report (Item 7) the same day as my request, and \nApplicant timely submitted documentation I labeled as AE C and D. There were no \nobjections, and all proffered post-hearing documents were admitted into evidence. The \nrecord closed July 24, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in June 1996. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Navy in 1996 and was honorably discharged in 2015. He married in 2019 and \nhas no children. After separating from the Navy, Applicant worked for a government \ncontractor from September 2017 to December 2020. Since January 2021, he has been \nemployed by a different government contractor as a senior data link analyst. He has held \na DOD security clearance since 2011. \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent accounts totaling $20,719. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted all four of the delinquent accounts. He provided no further information \nabout the circumstances that triggered these delinquencies nor his efforts to resolve \nthem. (Item 1) \nDuring his November 19, 2021 background interview, Applicant discussed the four \ndelinquent accounts listed in the SOR. He did not list them on his September 2021 \nsecurity clearance application, as required, due to oversight. He explained that these \naccounts became delinquent for several reasons: he had forgotten about paying them; \nhe had not received any statements; he was immature; he was unmotivated to pay; he \nhad used credit cards to pay for his wedding and honeymoon; financially he \u201cwas in over \nhis head\u201d; he had other bills that took priority; and he had insufficient income to pay off \nthese accounts. He told the investigator that he recently received a raise at work and \nplanned to use the additional income to pay these four delinquent accounts.

He was asked \nabout the four delinquent accounts, which he claimed he was repaying, but he did not \nattach supporting documentation. He also provided a July 2022 personal financial \nstatement that showed his monthly net income as $3,700. After paying his monthly \nexpenses, to include payments on the four delinquent accounts, he had a monthly net \nremainder of $1,000. He also provided a copy of his bi-weekly paystub. According to this \ninformation, it appears his monthly net income should reflect $6,894. In this scenario, after \npaying his monthly expenses, to include listed payments on the four SOR delinquent \ndebts, his monthly net remainder was over $4,500. (Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant is indebted to a federal credit union in the \napproximate amounts of $14,337, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in \n2019. In his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $200 on \nthis account, however, the July 2023 credit report shows that this account had not \nreceived payments and remains unpaid in the amount of $14,337. Applicant has not \nprovided sufficient documentation to show the current status of this account or what \nefforts, if any, he is making to pay this account. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 1, \nItem 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant is indebted to a federal credit union in the \napproximate amount of $5,627, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in 2019. \nIn his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $100 on this \naccount, however, the December 2022 repayment agreement showed that he had not \nmade any payments on the account until December 2022. Since that time, Applicant has \nmade monthly payments in accordance with the repayment agreement through July 2023. \nThis debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7; AE A, AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant is indebted to a federal credit union in the \napproximate amount of $500, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in 2019. \nIn his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $50 on this \naccount, however, the December 2022 repayment agreement showed that he had not \nmade any payments on the account until December 2022. Since that time, Applicant has \nmade monthly payments in accordance with the repayment agreement through July 2023. \nThis debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7; AE B, AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant is indebted to a collection agency in the \napproximate amount of $255 for an account referred for collection in 2018 by a bank. He \nhas not provided sufficient documentation to show the current status of this account or \nwhat efforts, if any, he is making to pay this account. This debt remains unresolved. (Item \n1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Government and the record established that Applicant has four delinquent \naccounts totaling approximately $20,719. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) \n(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose several years ago, they have persisted \nwith little evidence of debt-resolution efforts by him, even though he had the financial \nresources to do so. An individual entrusted to safeguard sensitive and classified \ninformation is expected to act in a financially responsible manner. During his November \n2021 security interview, Applicant acknowledged his financial delinquencies and \nexpressed his intent to make payment arrangements to resolve his debts; however, there \nis no evidence that he followed through on his stated intent. Also contributing to my \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s intent and credibility is the fact that he claimed he was making \nmonthly payments to his delinquent creditors on his July 2022 PFS, however, the record \nevidence showed that this was not the case. It was only after the SOR was issued in \nDecember 2022 when Applicant finally took action to begin resolving two out of the four \nSOR debts.

To receive full credit under Mitigating Condition 20(d), an \napplicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(d). The Appeal Board has \nconsistently held that a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d generally requires that an applicant has \nestablished a meaningful financial track record of payments, to include evidence of actual \ndebt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). Promises \nof future repayment are not a substitute for a history of payment. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015). Moreover, an applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his clearance is in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, \n2018). Given the facts that Applicant had made no payments to his four delinquent \ncreditors, as promised during his November 2021 background interview, or made monthly \npayments as claimed on his July 2021 PFS, I find that his finances continue to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

Although Applicant expressed \nhis intent to initiate debt-resolution efforts, there is no evidence that he has acted upon \nhis stated intent until the SOR was issued in December 2022. He failed to establish that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances after his PFS showed he had sufficient \nincome to establish payment plans and resolve his delinquent debts. Repaying these \ncreditors was not a priority until Applicant\u2019s security clearance was in peril. Given the \nentirety of the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Applicant setting up \nrepayment plans and making payments in accordance with the plans is a positive step. \nUnder his current circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
