He acknowledged, however, that he also \nmismanaged his finances, and he did not seek help when he should have. His finances \nspiraled in 2018, when he was hurt on the job and out of work for 11 months. In 2020, he \nwas hurt on the job again and he was out of work for eight months. During both periods, \nhe supported himself solely through workers\u2019 compensation, which amounted to only 66% \nof his gross annual salary. He testified that he contacted his creditors and informed them \nabout his inability to pay his debts after he suffered both on-the-job injuries, but only three \nof them, whose names he could not recall, were willing to work with him. Although he and \nhis fianc\u00e9e have lived together since October 2017, and she contributes to the household \nexpenses, he was the primary breadwinner and they maintained separate finances. He \nreturned to work in January 2022. He received a workers\u2019 compensation settlement of \n$5,000 in April 2022, which he used, in part, to resolve some of his debts.

He testified that \nhe filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2013 and 2015 in 2021, with the help of a \ntax company, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. He testified \nthat he did not realize he had not timely filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2013 \nand 2015. Upon returning from his 2013 overseas deployment, he did not think about \nfiling his federal income tax return for TY 2013. He testified that he did not timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for TY 2016 through 2019, because he was \u201cnot doing what I \nwas supposed to do at the time,\u201d and he acknowledged that he filed his federal income \ntax returns for those tax years after he completed his SCA, in which he was required to \nrespond to questions concerning his taxes. He also testified that he timely filed his federal \nincome tax returns for TY 2020. He also testified that he did not understand there was a \ndeadline in which he was required to file his federal income tax returns, or that he could \nhave requested an extension to do so.

Although he did not provide tax account transcripts for TY 2013 and 2015, he \ntestified that the tax company that filed on his behalf told him he did not owe any federal \nincome taxes for those tax years.

He testified that he also voluntarily mailed a \npayment toward his outstanding federal taxes, in the form of a check to the IRS in July \n2021, but the IRS had not yet cashed it. As of the date of the hearing, he had not taken \nany further action since July 2021 concerning his outstanding federal taxes.

He testified that he filed his state income tax returns for TY \n2013 and 2015 in 2021, through the same tax company that he used to file his federal \nincome tax returns for the same TY. He stated in his response to interrogatories that he \nwas awaiting transcripts from the state tax authority reflecting that he filed his state \nincome tax returns for TY 2013 and 2015.

(SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. at 44-53; GE 2, 3, 9; AE B) \nApplicant testified that he did not owe state taxes for TY 2013, 2015, 2018, or 2020, \nand that he paid $230 in state taxes that he owed for TY 2021 when he filed his state tax \nreturns for that TY.

He testified that he \nreceived only one notice from the state tax authority, in around 2016 or 2017, about his \noutstanding state taxes, after which time he made a one-time payment of $150.

He testified that he made only one to two payments, and then the creditor \nbegan garnishing his wages. He testified that his wages were being garnished to resolve \nthis settlement as of the date of the hearing.

He testified that he received only one notice from the state tax authority, \nin around 2016 or 2017, about his outstanding state taxes. He testified that he was \nunaware of the 2017 state tax lien when he completed his SCA, because he did not \nreceive any notice from the state tax authority about it, and that he first learned about the \nlien as he underwent the security clearance process. He testified that he did not disclose \nhis three VA debts on his SCA because they were not valid debts since he was \nerroneously billed. He testified that that he was unaware of most of the judgments entered \nagainst him, as he only received notice for one, which he did not think to disclose. He \ntestified that he mistakenly did not disclose his relevant car repossessions or wage \ngarnishments. He testified that he was no longer being garnished for the 2017 judgment \nwhen he completed the SCA, so he did not think he had to list it. He indicated during his \n2020 interview with a background investigator that he had so many debts that he was \nunable to list them all on his SCA, and he planned to address them during the interview. \n(Tr. at 47-48, 53-54, 77-82, 113-114) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. He also failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for TY 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2018, and his state income tax \nreturns for TY 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019. He failed to pay $20,463 in federal \ntaxes and $8,446 in state taxes, and a $5,538 state tax lien was entered against him \n2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his claims that he filed his federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2013 and 2015. Since July 2021, he has done nothing to try to resolve his \noutstanding federal taxes. Although he made payments to his outstanding state taxes \nafter he agreed on a payment plan with the state tax authority in July 2021, he did not \nabide by the terms of that plan. He did not provide any documentation to corroborate his \ncompliance with the payment plan he entered with the state tax authority in August 2022. \nWrits of garnishment were issued following judgments entered against Applicant for the \nbalances owed on several of his repossessed cars. He did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate his claims of payment, billing errors, payment plans, or other efforts to resolve \nhis consumer and medical debts, as well as his debts with the VA. He had not received \nany credit counseling. Applicant\u2019s finances are not under control and they continue to cast \ndoubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), \n20(d), and 20(g) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant does not have a handle on his finances. He did not have a handle on \nthem when he completed his SCA. He indicated as much during his 2020 interview, when \nhe explained that he had so many debts that he was unable to list them all and he resigned \nto just addressing them during the interview. His testimony that he was unaware of, he \ndid not think he had to, or he did not even think about disclosing, relevant information \nabout his finances on his SCA, further demonstrate his lack of control over his finances. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs such, I find that he did not deliberately falsify his responses to section 26 of his SCA. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nthat Applicant did not deliberately falsify his SCA, but he did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns arising from his history of unfiled tax returns and unpaid \ntaxes and other delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.z:   \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom she has worked since May 2023. She worked for the same contractor from October 2009 until July 2022, when she quit because she suffered serious health issues. She married in 1988 and divorced in 1998. She has an adult daughter. She took some online college courses from 1996 until 1997 but did not earn a degree. She earned a vocational certificate in 2005. She served on active duty in the Air Force from 1987 until 1994, when she earned an honorable discharge. (Tr. 18-26, 30; GE 1, 2; AE B, C) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s seven delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g), and delinquent state sales taxes for the business she owns (SOR \u00b6 1.h). These delinquencies consist of the following: credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e); a utility (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a telecommunications debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and state sales taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.h).

Applicant provided a response to the SOR on May 11, 2021 (Answer). \nShe requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me \non May 16, 2023. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on July 10, 2023. At the hearing, I \nadmitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 without objection. Applicant testified at \nthe hearing but did not present any documentary evidence. \nAmendment to the SOR \nDuring the hearing, based on Applicant's testimony, Department Counsel moved \nto amend the SOR under \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive to add the following allegation: \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.h.

I provided Applicant the option to \ncontinue the hearing until a later date to allow her the opportunity to respond to this new \nallegation, however, she wanted to proceed without a continuance. I left the record open \nuntil July 24, 2023, to allow Applicant to submit relevant documentation. She timely \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E that I admitted without objection. She \nalso submitted a document identifying these exhibits that I have labeled as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) 1. I received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on July 17, 2023. (Tr. 56-65) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom she \nhas worked since May 2023. She worked for the same contractor from October 2009 \nuntil July 2022, when she quit because she suffered serious health issues. She married \nin 1988 and divorced in 1998. She has an adult daughter. She took some online college \ncourses from 1996 until 1997 but did not earn a degree. She earned a vocational \ncertificate in 2005. She served on active duty in the Air Force from 1987 until 1994, \nwhen she earned an honorable discharge. (Tr. 18-26, 30; GE 1, 2; AE B, C) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s seven delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $30,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g), and delinquent state sales taxes for \nthe business she owns (SOR \u00b6 1.h). These delinquencies consist of the following: credit \ncards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e); a utility (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a telecommunications debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g); and state sales taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.h). She admitted the SOR allegations with \nadditional comments. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR \nallegations are established through her admissions and the Government\u2019s credit \nreports. (Tr. 64; Answer; GE 1-5) \nApplicant has not resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. As \nevidenced by the Government credit reports, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c through \n1.e were delinquent by early 2017, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was delinquent by March \n2019. As evidenced by her listing them in her March 2020 Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (SF 86), the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were delinquent by \nMarch 2020. She disputed the amount of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, but she did not provide \ndocumentation to substantiate why she owes less. She relies on the fact that she \ndisputed the debt, and the debt no longer appears on a credit report as proof that she \nresolved it. She claimed that she reached out to the creditors for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.f, and 1.g \u201cduring COVID\u201d to attempt to resolve those debts, but she did not hear \nback from those creditors. She has not made any resolution attempts on those debts \nsince then. She has made no resolution attempts on the remaining debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.e), because she claimed she did not have the available funds to make \npayments. She claimed that she has made payment arrangements with several of her \ncreditors after the hearing and is scheduled to make payments beginning in August \n2023. She provided no documentation to corroborate these arrangements and did not \nspecify the creditors or the payment amounts.

She was not collecting the taxes because she was \ndisorganized, did not understand the process, and had other expenses she covered \ninstead. In about 2018, she made a payment arrangement with State A to pay $150 per \nmonth to satisfy the Food Truck\u2019s delinquent sales taxes, but she defaulted on those \npayments in about 2020 because the Food Truck was not making enough money. In \nabout November 2022, State A audited the Food Truck and determined that the \nbusiness owed about $12,000 in delinquent sales taxes. In about May 2023, she made \na payment arrangement with State A to pay about $450 per month towards those \ndelinquent sales taxes. She has been current on this payment arrangement since she \nmade it. She now appropriately collects the state sales tax for the Food Truck and does \nnot believe that she will fall further behind on these taxes in the future. (Tr. 48-55, 58-\n61, 68-71; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nIn addition to the aforementioned causes of her delinquent state sales taxes, \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by her starting a business in 2016 that was \nlosing money until 2022, when it started to break even. The COVID-19 pandemic \ncontributed to the Food Truck\u2019s problems by not allowing her to fully operate it. She also \nhad a 10-month period of unemployment from July 2022 until May 2023, that was \ncaused by a serious chronic health issue that caused her to fear for her life. After a \ndiagnosis and treatment, this chronic health issue has stabilized. She had additional \nhealth problems when she fell in September 2022, causing a concussion and a broken \nbone. She also broke her wrist in March 2023. (Tr. 18-20, 26-40, 65; Answer; AE B-E) \nApplicant earned about $4,600 per month in take-home pay before she became \nunemployed in July 2022. She has earned about $4,800 per month in take-home pay \nsince she was rehired in May 2023. She has received about $165 per month from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) in disability benefits. She is not delinquent on any \naccounts other than those listed in the SOR, but she has been a month behind on her \ncar payment, her car insurance, and her cable bill in the last few months. She does not \nhave much money left over after her expenses are paid and has about $160 combined \nin her checking and savings accounts. She has no retirement savings as she cashed \nthose out to help her stay afloat while she was unemployed. She owes $3,000 to her \nsiblings that she borrowed while she was unemployed. She also survived on Medicaid \nand food stamps while she was unemployed. She believes that she will be able to start \nsaving enough money to pay her delinquencies, including the money she owes her \nsiblings, in September or October 2023. Despite the financial problems the Food Truck \nhas caused her, she plans to continue with it.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs evidenced by her longstanding financial delinquencies, Applicant has a history \nof being unable to pay her debts. The above listed conditions are applicable, thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant made a payment arrangement to pay the Food Truck\u2019s delinquent \nsales taxes and she has complied with that agreement. AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(g) fully \napply to the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nApplicant has not resolved any of the other SOR debts, so they are ongoing. She \nhas not shown that she has sufficient surplus income to pay these debts and has not \nmaintained a track record of financial responsibility. As evidenced by the timing, the \nprimary reason these debts became delinquent was that the Food Truck was \nunsuccessful (COVID, her health issues, and unemployment merely delayed her ability \nto address the delinquencies afterward). She has shown an unreasonable willingness to \nstick with it despite it not turning a profit. For these reasons, I cannot find that her \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s non sales tax financial issues resulted from causes such as health \nissues, unemployment, and an unsuccessful business venture, which were largely \nbeyond her control. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, she must also show that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She has not. She has not resolved any of the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. She attempted to make a payment arrangement on \nonly some of these debts. With respect to those attempts, the evidence shows that she \ndid so \u201cduring COVID\u201d and made no such effort again until after the hearing. An \napplicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). For these reasons AG \u00b6 \n20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not fully apply to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g. \nApplicant claimed that she disputed the amount of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. While \nclaiming an inaccurate balance on a debt is a reasonable basis to dispute it, she did not \nprovide documented proof to substantiate that the balance was too high. Furthermore, \nher evidence of actions she took to resolve the issue is insufficient. She claimed, \nwithout documentary corroboration, that she disputed the debt with the creditor, and \nthen the debt disappeared from her credit report. There are many reasons other than \nfavorable resolution that a debt does not appear on a credit report, and it is her burden \nto provide evidence that a successful dispute caused the removal. She has not provided \nthis evidence. See ISCR Case No. 20-03691 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2023) at 3. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

He obtained his general educational development certification in 2014. He was \nunemployed from December 2008 to June 2012, and from September 2015 to January \n2017. He worked as a laborer for the same DOD contractor from June 2012 to August \n2015, and from January 2017 to December 2018. He has worked as a laborer for a \ndifferent DOD contractor since December 2018, through whom he is assigned to work at \nshipyards throughout the United States. He has never held a security clearance. He has \nresided in state A since 2013. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 8-10, 24-25, 48-52, 65-66, 75; GE 1, \n5; AE A) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had six delinquent student loans, totaling \napproximately $25,539. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) The delinquent student loans are reported on \ncredit bureau reports from 2017 to 2020. They were not reported on credit bureau reports \nfrom 2022. (Tr. at 40-43; GE 2-4, 7; AE A) \nApplicant maintained that he was a victim of identity theft given that he has not \nattended school beyond high school, and never applied for student loans. He opined that \nsomeone must have stolen his identity during a period when he briefly resided with \nacquaintances in approximately 2012 in state B ( where the student loans were incurred), \nbefore moving to state A in 2013. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 25-48, 53-80; GE 1, 3, 5; AE A) \nApplicant first learned that student loans were incurred in his name, without his \npermission, in 2013, when he began receiving telephone calls from a school located in \nstate B seeking payment on the loans. He communicated with the school and \nunsuccessfully attempted to obtain further information about the individual who stole his \nidentity. He also telephoned the student loan creditor, who instructed him to file a dispute \nwith the credit reporting agencies. He also telephoned the state B police department and \nattempted to file a report, but he was told he had to file a police report in person or online. \nHe recalled receiving a garnishment letter from the school, in approximately 2015, but he \ndid not recall whether his employer garnished his pay before he became unemployed that \nAugust. He telephonically disputed the student loans with the credit reporting agencies in \n2017, May 2019, and October 2019, and he was informed that they would send a dispute \nletter to the school on his behalf. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 25-48, 53-80; GE 1, 3, 5; AE A) \nIn 2021, Applicant attempted multiple times to file an online police report with the \nstate B police department, but his responses to the questions did not permit him to do so, \nand he was told that he had to file a police report in person. He went to the state A police \ndepartment and attempted to file a courtesy police report with state B, but he was told \nthat he could not do so. At one point, he and his spouse discussed hiring an attorney to \nfurther assist him, but they could not afford the attorney\u2019s fees with their income. He \nintends to continue disputing these student loans on his credit reports.

He indicated that he and his spouse, who worked as a nail technician, were able \nto financially support their family. He does not have any other delinquent debts. He has \nnot received credit counseling. Since approximately 2002, he has worked with a credit \nrepair law firm to try to build his credit so he and his spouse can purchase a home. He \nalso monitors his credit through Credit Karma (Tr. at 72-74; GE 5; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe credit bureau reports, which reflect the student loans incurred in Applicant\u2019s \nname, raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nBefore the SOR, Applicant made multiple attempts to report that he was a victim \nof identity theft and to dispute the student loans reported on his credit bureau reports. \nThey are no longer reported on the 2022 credit bureau reports, and he intends to continue \nto dispute them. He does not have any other delinquent debts. His finances are under \ncontrol, and they do not continue to cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Applicant testified and offered no documentary exhibits. \nThe record was held open until June 28, 2022, to permit Applicant to submit documents, \nwhich he did. Those documents were marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through E and \nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on June \n22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions in June 2016 \nand November 2019 that were dismissed due to his failure to file required information, \nand five delinquent debts, totaling approximately $37,288, including a mortgage past-due \nin the amount of $23,288. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e with \nexplanation. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married in October 1998, separated in August 2018, \nand divorced in May 2019. He has one child, age eight, and two adult stepchildren ages, \n18 and 20, from his marriage. He is engaged and has resided in his fianc\u00e9\u2019s home since \nMay 2020, they have one child, age one. His two youngest children reside with Applicant. \nHe attended technical school from March 2012 to October 2015 and has earned multiple \ncertificates. He has been employed as a technician for a federal contractor since October \n2016 and has been site lead since June 2020. He held a security clearance while on \nactive duty in the Navy. (GE 1; Tr. 37-51, 135-136) \nApplicant served in the United States Navy from October 2002 to October 2013 \nattaining the paygrade of E-6 and was honorably discharged. The stated reason for \nseparation was \u201cDisability, Severance Pay, Non-Combat\u201d and he received \u201cDisability \nSeverance Pay\u201d of $70,148 when discharged. He completed extensive training and many \nschools while in the Navy, was qualified in submarines, earned multiple qualifications, \nand received numerous awards and decorations. (AE D) \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to severe back issues that resulted in \nhis medical discharge from the Navy and unemployment/underemployment, and to his \nformer spouse\u2019s financial irresponsibility, separation, and divorce. He testified that he was \nbedridden for approximately 18 months before and after back surgery from sometime in \n2013 until late 2014. He experienced significant back pain until a second surgery in 2015 \nalleviated most of his pain issues and enabled him to obtain employment as a federal \ncontractor. He reported being unemployed from September 2013 to January 2014. From \nJanuary 2014 to October 2014, he worked part-time doing administrative work for an auto \nrepair business earning $300 a week.

Credit reports from March 2019 and April 2020 reflect the account \nas past due for $5,764 and $23,238, respectively. In response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the mortgage account had been past due, but said it was then current and \nsubmitted evidence corroborating his claim. He testified that he obtained the mortgage in \n2008, that it was delinquent in approximately 2013 and again in 2018. He attributed the \n2018 delinquency to his wife\u2019s failure to make agreed upon payments while they were \nseparated. He said that he was unaware that she missed payments and about a pending \nforeclosure because account statements were sent to her address. After she moved out, \nhe returned to the family home, and filed for bankruptcy in November 2019 to forestall \nforeclosure. He moved in with his fianc\u00e9 in May 2020 and has paid the mortgage with \nrental income from the property since. He provided a September 2020 loan modification \nagreement and account statements showing payments from November 2020 to May \n2022. His balance due in June 2022, included the required monthly payment ($1,414.74) \nand one overdue payment ($1,414.74). This account is being resolved.

An April 2020 credit \nreport shows the account as charged off with a past due balance of $3,738. The credit \nreport reflects delinquencies in 2015 and the last account activity in October 2019. In \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted the account had been charged off and said that \nhe was attempting to settle the account. He testified that his ex-wife had opened the \naccount without his knowledge using a power of attorney that he had previously provided \nher, and thought that he had paid the card off in late 2021. He provided an email from the \ncreditor dated June 13, 2022, stating his credit card account \u201cwas delinquent with a $0.00 \nbalance.\u201d This account is resolved.

An April 2020 credit report reflects the account as charged off with a past due \nbalance of $1,071. In response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation stating that \nhe thought the account had been paid. He testified that he had opened the joint account \nwith his ex-wife and thought he paid it off in approximately 2018. He provided a letter from \nthe creditor dated June 23, 2022 stating the account balance was $0.00. This debt is \nresolved.

This account is being resolved. (GE 3; SOR \nResponse; Tr. 92-94, 127; AE A at 3) \nSOR \u00b61.e: medical collection account for $450. A March 2019 credit report \nshows the account was assigned for collection in July 2017 with a balance of $450. An \nApril 2020 credit report does not reflect this account or delinquency. In response to the \nSOR, Applicant denied the allegation and said that he paid the agreed upon copayment \nfor dental work, and later received a bill from the dentist. He said that he contacted the \ncollection agency and requested evidence the debt was legitimate. He testified that after \nreceiving the bill, he contacted the dentist\u2019s office, that they agreed with him and \ndemanded payment from his insurance company, that he had not been contacted about \nthe debt since, and that it was no longer on his credit report. I find that GE 2 corroborates \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that the debt was resolved.

He said that he filed for bankruptcy in June 2016 \nto prevent foreclosure after his wife failed to make payments while he was bedridden. He \nstated that the November 2019 bankruptcy filing was to prevent a second foreclosure on \nthe family home because his wife failed to pay her share of the mortgage in accordance \nwith their separation agreement, unbeknownst to him until he moved back into the home \nin 2019. (GE 2, 4; SOR Response; Tr. 30-31, 37-39, 99) \nApplicant testified that he received financial counseling through a workshop and \nnow uses a digital application to help manage his budget. He said that his financial \ncondition has improved. He reported gross annual income of $56,000 (federal contractor \npay) with net monthly earnings of approximately $2,800, and $1,200 monthly disability \npayments (Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability payments for 80% permanent \ndisability rating). After receiving the SOR, he reported developing and executing a plan \nto get his remaining debts in order. He reported retirement savings ($9,159), a checking \naccount ($508), employer retirement account ($8,000) and more than $100,000 equity in \na home purchased in about 2010 and occupied by his parents.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for assignment to a public trust position. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish that he has a history of \nfinancial problems dating back to at least 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(d) are established. Applicant has resolved or is resolving \nall five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His delinquent debts and bankruptcy filings \noccurred under unique circumstances unlikely to recur. His delinquent debts were largely \nbeyond his control including his medical conditions resulting in his discharge from the \nNavy, lengthy recovery period, unemployment and underemployment, and his separation \nand divorce. He acted responsibly under the circumstances, received financial \ncounseling, initiated and is adhering to good faith efforts to resolve his two largest debts. \nHis handling of his finances does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were already \naddressed, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 38 years old, served in the United States Navy for 11 years, was \nhonorably discharged because of service-connected medical disability in October 2014, \nand has been rated 80% permanently disabled by the VA. I also considered his extensive \ntraining and submarine qualifications, awards, decorations, and that he held a security \nclearance while in the Navy. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010).

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January \n27, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old network engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from November 2009 \nto November 2017 and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance in \nthe Navy. \nApplicant married in June 2009 and divorced in October 2012. He married his \ncurrent spouse recently on a date not reflected in the record. He has taken college \ncourses since August 2019 but has not received a degree. \nApplicant testified that his financial problems began around 2016, when his then \ngirlfriend became pregnant, and he felt an obligation to assist her financially. He stopped \nthe financial assistance after she had an abortion in May 2017. (Tr. 21, 31.) He has since \nmarried his current spouse and has no further obligations to his ex-girlfriend. \nAt about the same time, Applicant was involved in an automobile accident in which \nhis vehicle was totaled, but his insurance coverage was insufficient to cover the full cost \nof replacing it. It appears that he was at fault in the accident, having rear-ended another \nvehicle. (GX 1 at 37-42; Tr. 31-35.) \nApplicant testified that he has been unable to deploy for the past 15 months \nbecause his security clearance was suspended. Previously, about one-third of his \nincome, about $30,000, was from extra pay during deployments. In addition, his wife, who \nis a barber, had reduced income during COVID-19. (Tr. 23-25.) \nApplicant testified that he hired a debt-consolidation company to help him resolve \nhis delinquent debts. He paid the company about $300 per month for more than two years, \nuntil a judgment was entered against him and he realized that it had not provided any \nservices. (Tr. 19.) He did not provide any documentation of his contract with the debt-\nconsolidation company or payments to them. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f are delinquent credit-card accounts totaling \nabout $26,976.

I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw SOR \u00b6 1.k. (Tr. 14.) \nApplicant testified that he contacted the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but the \ncreditor would not discuss the debt with him because he was represented by the debt-\nconsolidation company. (Tr. 39.) He made no further attempts to resolve this debt. As of \nthe date of the hearing, he had not contacted any of the other creditors alleged in the \nSOR. (Tr. 52.) \nApplicant currently earns about $5,200 per month, and his spouse works four days \na week and earns $100 to $150 per day. He described his financial situation as \u201cliving \npaycheck to paycheck.\u201d (Tr. 44.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially\noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The unexpected pregnancy of Applicant\u2019s ex-\ngirlfriend, the loss of his motor vehicle in an accident, and the apparent fraud perpetrated \nby a debt-resolution company were conditions largely beyond his control. (I have given \nhim the benefit of the doubt on his level of responsibility for the motor vehicle accident.) \nHowever, he has not acted responsibly. He admitted that, except for one unsuccessful \ncontact with one creditor, he has not contacted any of his creditors or otherwise attempted \nto resolve his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. The debt-resolution company was not \u201ca legitimate\nand credible source\u201d of financial counseling, and Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not \nunder control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of good-faith efforts \nto resolve his debts. He was given additional time after the hearing to submit evidence, \nbut he submitted no evidence of efforts to contact his creditors or resolve the debts \nalleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR (as amended) alleged that Applicant owed $48,968 for 17 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.q). Eight of the debts alleged (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p and 1.q) are for unpaid medical accounts. Five others (SOR 1.g \u2013 1.k) are for unpaid student loans. The remaining allegations address unpaid commercial accounts. In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and provided an explanatory statement. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 44 years old and is employed by a defense contractor, for whom she has worked, first as a temporary staffing hire then as a direct hire, since October 2019. 2 This is her first application for a security clearance. She and her husband have been married since September 2007, but they have separated several times. As of the hearing, they were living together but had experienced at least one separation of about four months after March 2020. She has two teenage children and one adult child, all of whom still live with her. Between 2010 and 2011, and in 2013, she attended community and state colleges but did not earn a degree. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 31) Applicant did not disclose any adverse financial information as she was required to do in e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record).

Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) could not affirmatively determine that it \nis clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 20, 2021, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The DCSA CAF issued the SOR pursuant to \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as \namended; and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 21, 2021, and initially \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. As provided for by \nparagraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM). On April 27, 2012, after \nreceiving the FORM and discussing the case with Department Counsel, Applicant asked \nfor a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 24, 2022, and I scheduled a hearing to be held on December 6, 2022, via online \nvideo teleconferencing. The parties appeared as scheduled, and Applicant testified in her \nown behalf. She also proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B. Department Counsel \nproffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3. I admitted all exhibits without objection. A \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on December 14, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nThe date originally listed on the SOR was January 20, 2020. A comparison of that \ndate with the date of the digital signature of the DOD adjudicator on page 3, shows that \nthe SOR was issued in 2021, not 2020. This discrepancy was corrected at hearing. (Tr. \n10 \u2013 12) \nAlso at hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR allegations 1.r and \n1.s. Without objection, I granted the motion. (Tr. 22 \u2013 23) \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR (as amended) alleged that Applicant owed $48,968 \nfor 17 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.q). Eight of the debts alleged (SOR 1.a \n\u2013 1.d, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p and 1.q) are for unpaid medical accounts. Five others (SOR 1.g \u2013 1.k) \nare for unpaid student loans. The remaining allegations address unpaid commercial \naccounts. In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, and provided an \nexplanatory statement. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I \nmake the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old and is employed by a defense contractor, for whom she \nhas worked, first as a temporary staffing hire then as a direct hire, since October 2019. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nThis is her first application for a security clearance. She and her husband have been \nmarried since September 2007, but they have separated several times. As of the hearing, \nthey were living together but had experienced at least one separation of about four \nmonths after March 2020. She has two teenage children and one adult child, all of whom \nstill live with her. Between 2010 and 2011, and in 2013, she attended community and \nstate colleges but did not earn a degree. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 31) \nApplicant did not disclose any adverse financial information as she was required \nto do in e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record). As part of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, government investigators obtained two credit reports (CR) that documented \nall of the debts alleged in the SOR. On January 28, 2020, Applicant was interviewed about \nher finances by a government investigator. The summary of that interview further \ndocuments the debts alleged in the SOR. A CR obtained in November 2022 documents \nthe debts at SOR 1.f and 1.e. (GX 1 \u2013 5) Applicant\u2019s exhibits consist of an unexecuted \nU.S. Department of Education \u201cIncome-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plan Request\u201d (AX A), \nand copies of email correspondence between Applicant and a credit repair firm she used \nin 2021 (AX B). \nApplicant has been unemployed at least four times since 2009, the longest such \nperiod being between 2009 and 2013, when she had to leave work to care for her elderly \nmother, who could not afford to obtain skilled nursing assistance. Most recently, she was \nunemployed for about five months before she started working for her current employer. \nMost of the time when she has worked, she either has had employer-provided medical \ninsurance or was able to qualify for Medicaid. When she was out of work, she had to rely \non her husband\u2019s Medicaid; however, during their separations, which were not \ndocumented through the courts, she was not able to use his Medicaid. According to her \ntestimony, the state in which she lives requires a married person to show a legal \nseparation to qualify for public assistance, such as Medicaid and food stamps. (GX 1; GX \n2; Tr. 31 \u2013 34, 48 \u2013 50) \nApplicant obtained the student loans alleged in SOR 1.g \u2013 1.k to fund tuition for \nher college studies. When she was interviewed by a government investigator in January \n2020, she acknowledged that those accounts became delinquent around 2017, and that \nshe was relying on the diversion of her federal income tax refunds to help pay down her \nstudent loans. However, she testified that she has not filed a federal income tax return for \nthe past three years on advice of her tax preparer. Thus, she has not received refunds \nfor those years that could be applied to her student loans. According to the most recent \nCR available, she now has a single student loan account for $23,369, roughly the same \nas the total of the student loans alleged at SOR 1.g \u2013 1.k. The account was opened in \nOctober 2021 and is not listed as delinquent or past-due; however, there are no payments \nreflected for that account. Applicant testified she first addressed her student loans about \nfour years ago. In September or October 2022, she submitted an IDR Plan Request to \nthe Department of Education. She has not yet received a response to her request, and \nshe has not otherwise made any loan payments.

She has not made any payments directly to those creditors. In mid-\n2021, she worked with a credit repair firm and made two payments through them. \nHowever, after less than six months she stopped using them because she did not see \nany progress in either addressing her debts or cleaning up her credit history. (GX 2; AX \nB; Tr. 42 \u2013 43) \nApplicant has not made any payments on the commercial debts alleged at SOR \n1.e, 1.f, 1.n, and 1.o. As to SOR 1.e, she testified that she does not recognize that creditor; \nhowever, during her PSI, she identified it as a loan (original amount of $497) that became \ndelinquent in 2016 when she was out of work. (GX 2) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to a combination of life events, such as \nher unstable marriage and periods of unemployment, and her poor financial management \nin the past. She testified that she understands the importance of resolving her debts, but \nshe is not presently able to do so. She lives \u201ccheck to check\u201d and cannot afford to make \nany payments to her creditors. Recent credit information shows she incurred a past-due \ncellphone bill because her adult son failed to pay an account she opened for him using \nher credit. In February 2022, she co-signed an auto loan for her husband with a $618 \nmonthly payment that became past due by at least one month as of November 2022. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 46 \u2013 47) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport all of the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past due or \ndelinquent debt that is still outstanding. This information reasonably raises a security \nconcern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these mitigating conditions can be applied based on this record. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and multiple. She still owes nearly $49,000 for \neight unpaid debts that have accrued since 2016. Although it appears that she incurred \nher debts through circumstance beyond her control \u2013 periods of unemployment, lack of \nmedical insurance, and periods of marital separation \u2013 Applicant did not establish that \nshe acted responsibly in the face of those circumstances. Although not alleged in the \nSOR, information developed during the hearing shows she recently has made ill-advised \nfinancial decisions, such as co-signing a car loan that is now past-due and using her credit \ninformation to open her son\u2019s cellphone account that is now delinquent. She also has not \nfiled income tax returns for the past three tax years, which contradicts her stated reliance \non income tax refund diversions to help reduce her student loan debt. Further, Applicant \nused a credit assistance firm to address her medical debts, but that approach lasted less \nthan six months and did not produce any identifiable improvements in her financial \ncondition. Finally, Applicant has not made any payments to her creditors. She did not \npresent a plan to begin resolving her debts, and while she has applied for relief from the \nU.S. Department of Education, information about that initiative is incomplete, at best. \nApplicant did not present sufficient useful or encouraging information that shows \nshe can resolve her debts or will manage her personal finances in a way that would help \nher avoid such financial problems in the future. On balance, I conclude Applicant has not \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nmet her burden of persuasion and that she has not mitigated the security concerns \nestablished by the Government\u2019s information.  \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). The record evidence as a whole presents significant remaining doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Because protection of the \nnational interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be \nresolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r and 1.s: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.d with no further explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 26 years old. He has never married and has no children. He attended college from 2014 through 2016, but did not obtain a degree. He has been with his current employer as an alarm respondent since June 2017. (Tr. 24; GX 1) All four of the SOR allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($7,507), 1.b ($7,473), 1.c ($4,149) and 1.d ($4,131), concern Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal student loans. In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions, the debts are listed in collection status in his March 2020 credit report. (GX 3) Applicant did not disclose any delinquent accounts in his February 2020 SCA. However, during his April 2020 background interview, he told the investigator that the student loans were related to tuition from his time in college. He claimed that he had assumed the loans had been closed after leaving college because he never received any communication from the college or the Department of Education (DOE).

His recent promises to pay are insufficient to establish a track record of \nfinancial responsibility and do not mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 7, 2020. \nOn April 15, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations.

The case was assigned to me on March 14, 2023. On \nMarch 23, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 25, 2023. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 3, which were admitted without objection. The Government\u2019s pre-hearing \ndisclosure letter, dated June 30, 2022, and my case management order, dated \nMay 5, 2023, are marked as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II, respectively. Applicant \ntestified and did not submit any exhibits. The record was held open until May 12, 2023, \nfor either party to submit additional exhibits, which neither did. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on May 2, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.d with no further explanations. \nHis admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 26 years old. He has never married and has no children. He \nattended college from 2014 through 2016, but did not obtain a degree. He has been \nwith his current employer as an alarm respondent since June 2017. (Tr. 24; GX 1) \nAll four of the SOR allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($7,507), 1.b ($7,473), 1.c ($4,149) and \n1.d ($4,131), concern Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal student loans. In addition to \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the debts are listed in collection status in his March 2020 credit \nreport. (GX 3) \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent accounts in his February 2020 SCA. \nHowever, during his April 2020 background interview, he told the investigator that the \nstudent loans were related to tuition from his time in college. He claimed that he had \nassumed the loans had been closed after leaving college because he never received \nany communication from the college or the Department of Education (DOE). He further \nclaimed that the student loans did not appear on his credit report and that he was \n\u201cunaware\u201d they were in collection. He assured the investigator he would take immediate \nsteps to contact DOE and request a payment plan. \nHowever, at his hearing, Applicant testified that he never took out student loans \nto finance his college education. Instead, he claimed that he received a \u201cfull-ride\u201d \nscholarship to play football for the college. In fall 2014, he enrolled in classes and \npracticed with the football team. Because of poor equipment and field conditions, \nApplicant experienced a significant injury and did not play his entire first season. Still, he \ncontinued his studies.

In spring 2016, his coach informed him that he was \nreleased from the team and had lost his scholarship. Applicant claimed that he went \nhome that summer and never heard from the college again. With the loss of his \nscholarship, Applicant could not afford to continue his studies and left college. (Tr. 19-\n20, 35-37)  \nDuring his testimony, Applicant repeatedly claimed that he never applied for \nstudent loans and that his tuition, room and board were all covered by the scholarship. \nHowever, he did admit to meeting with financial counselors while at the college, \nalthough he could not recall any details of the conversations he had with them. He later \nadmitted that it was possible he took out student loans, but had no recollection of doing \nso. (Tr. 22-23, 27, 65) \nApplicant claimed that he first learned about his student loans when he checked \nhis credit report in 2019, but he did not arrange any payments. Instead, he attempted to \ncontact the college several times for clarification. He claimed the college had new staff \nwho told him they had no record of his enrollment. During this time, he did not contact \nDOE. (Tr. 29, 53-56) \nEven after his interview in April 2020, Applicant never contacted DOE or a credit-\nreporting agency to verify the validity of his student loans. Instead, he claimed he \ncontacted a financial counselor, but could not recall any details about the person or \nbusiness he contacted, and he did not engage in their services. He admitted that he \nbecame distracted by other personal matters and overlooked his loans. \nDespite the uncertainty regarding the origin of his student loans, Applicant \nadmitted responsibility for them. He testified that he planned to pay the loans, but still \nhad not contacted DOE. (Tr. 30-32, 56-62) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that, in March 2020, payments \non federal student loans were paused by presidential executive order as part of the \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The pause included \nseveral relief measures for eligible loans such as a suspension of loan payments; a 0% \ninterest rate; and suspension of collection efforts on defaulted loans. More information \nabout the CARES Act is available at the Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nI further note that, in August 2022, President Biden announced a plan for the \nforgiveness of various amounts of federal student loan debt. Litigation regarding the \nconstitutionality of this plan followed, and a decision by the Supreme Court remains \npending as of this writing. In December 2022, the DOE stated that the pause on the \npayment \nof \nstudent \nloans \nwould \nextend \nthrough \nat \nleast \nJune \n2023. \nhttps://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that his annual salary was just under $40,000. Even so, he \nwas able to save about $100 per month because he lived with his parents and kept his \nexpenses to a minimum. However, Applicant also admitted that he had not filed his \n2021 federal and state tax returns because he owed about $400 to the state. He timely \nfiled his 2022 tax returns and did not owe any additional taxes. His unfiled 2021 tax \nreturns and delinquent tax debt are not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 39-43, 59, 63) \nApplicant stated he had no academic issues while attending college and has had \nno disciplinary issues with his employer. He acknowledged that he had been financially \nirresponsible over the past couple of years by not resolving his student loans, but that \nthe hearing was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d and he promised he would start paying them. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes two conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent student loans are established by his admissions and the \ncredit report in the record. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nThere are four pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant left college in 2016 because he lost his football scholarship. He claimed \nthat he did not learn about his federal student loans until he reviewed his credit report in \n2019. Once he learned about the loans, he contacted the college for clarification and \nwas eventually informed they had no record of his enrollment. However, he never \ncontacted DOE to ascertain the origin of the loans or establish a payment plan. Instead, \nhe became distracted by other life events. \nAt hearing, Applicant committed to contacting DOE and paying his student loans. \nHowever, promises to pay delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially \nresponsible manner. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019) \nWhile Applicant\u2019s obligation to pay his federal student loans is currently paused \nunder the CARES Act, his loans already were delinquent in March 2020. Moreover, \ncomplete reliance on the COVID-19 pandemic-based student loans deferment to \nestablish mitigation of security clearance concerns is misplaced. See ISCR Case No. \n20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2021); ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, \n2021). \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. While the circumstances that \nled to his departure from college were largely beyond his control, he has not shown \nresponsible action by contacting DOE for clarification of his loans or by establishing a \ntrack record of payments. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s unfiled 2021 tax returns and delinquent state taxes are \nnot alleged in the SOR, but they undercut assertions of mitigation as they show \nadditional unresolved delinquencies. Although he made some unspecified efforts to \nobtain financial counseling, his financial issues are unresolved. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nIn 2014, Applicant entered college on what he perceived to be a full football \nscholarship. However, two significant injuries in two years kept him off the field and he \nlost his scholarship in 2016. Although he has no recollection of taking out student loans, \nhe admitted it was possible. \nOnce Applicant learned about his student loans in 2019, he did take some action \nin contacting the college. During his background interview, Applicant recognized the \nloans and stated his intent to resolve them. However, he never contacted DOE to seek \nclarification of the loans or establish a payment plan. Instead, he became distracted by \nother life events and he continued to neglect the loans. \nApplicant described the hearing as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to address his financial \ncircumstances.

For good cause shown, \nApplicant was granted seven calendar days to supplement the record with a written \nbudget. Department Counsel was afforded two days to respond. \nWithin the time \npermitted, applicant furnished a written budget. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted \nwithout objection as Applicant\u2019s AE A. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated five delinquent \ndebts exceeding $24,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved and remain \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged SOR debts that \nwere either charged off or in collection. He added no explanations or clarifications. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE 2; Tr. 18) Despite his past promises made to an investigator from he \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) in December 2019 to contact his identified \ncreditors holding his five delinquent accounts, he failed to do so. (GE 2; Tr. 20-26) \nAltogether, Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts exceed $24,000 and remain unresolved and \noutstanding. \nApplicant acknowledged his financial mistakes and hopes to begin addressing \nhis debt delinquencies with his improved employment situation. (Tr. 20) He did not \nprovide any developed, well-organized payment plan or written budget for addressing \nhis debts. \nApplicant currently nets $3,400 a month from his work. (Tr. 29-30) He has no \nconsistent monthly remainder in which to access discretionary funds to address his \ndebts. (Tr. 29-30) He has a 401(k) retirement account with an approximate $2,600 \nbalance in the account. (Tr. 30) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of five \ndelinquent debts exceeding $24,000 in the aggregate. These collective debt \ndelinquencies warrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial considerations guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \n\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts with explanations require no independent\nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \n\u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing.\n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies is critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                               \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted some of the SOR allegations, with explanations, and denied \nother allegations. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a \nreview of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She began working \nwith her current employer in November 2018. She has worked for one federal contractor \nor another as a technical writer since 2001. She is a high school graduate with some \ncollege credits. She married for the first time in June 2021. She has three adult children. \nShe has held a security clearance since 2005. (Tr. 6, 23, 25, 42, GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent debts including a vehicle repossession, two \nconsumer debts, and a debt from an educational advance given by a previous employer, \nall totaling $31,152. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) Three debts were listed in a credit report from \nJanuary 2020 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) and the fourth (SOR \u00b6 1.d) is supported by her admissions \nto a background investigator in January 2020. None of the debts are listed in the most \nrecent credit report contained in the record from October 2022. (GE 2-3, 6) \nApplicant credibly explained that her financial difficulties resulted from helping her \ndaughter, who was in an abusive relationship, and her brother. She provided living \narrangements for both of them and both abused Applicant\u2019s generosity. When she \nrecently married, her husband made it a point to help her resist her family from abusing \nher generosity. She no longer loans money or allows her family members to stay with her. \n(Tr. 25-26, 34, 43) \nThe status of her delinquent debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \nVehicle repossession deficiency-$13,514 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). This debt was assigned \nfor collection in December 2015. It was charged off in April 2019. Applicant admitted that \nshe financed this vehicle. She stated that she was working about 100 hours a week when \nshe financed this car and simply forgot to make the payments. Once it was repossessed, \nshe attempted to negotiate a settlement with the creditor but it would only accept full \npayment. She could not afford to make full payment at the time, so it was charged off. For \ntax year 2021, Applicant documented receiving an IRS Form 1099-C, cancelation of debt, \nfrom the creditor for SOR debt \u00b6 1.a. Applicant indicated she would file an amended return \nand claim the amount as income as required. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 27-30; AE D) \nConsumer debt-$110 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant explained that this debt was for a \nmilk-delivery service. When she stopped the delivery, the company continued to bill her \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the service. She contacted them and the debt was cancelled. It no longer appears on \nher credit report. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 31; GE 6; AE A-B) \nConsumer debt-$528 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant credibly explained that she was \ncharged this expense for failing to turn in telecommunication equipment. She denied that \nfailure and documented communication with the creditor showing that she turned in the \ndisputed equipment. This debt no longer appears on her credit report. It is resolved. (Tr. \n31; AE E) \nEducational debt to former employer-$17,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant credibly \nexplained that this educational debt was incurred when she received financing from a \nformer employer to attend school. This debt would be paid by the company with no \npayback obligation from Applicant, as long as she remained employed by the company \nfor 12 months. Short of that 12-month period, Applicant took a job with another employer. \nShe talked to her former employer\u2019s human resources (HR) office about the ramifications \nof this decision. Applicant believed that even though she did not stay at the company for \n12 calendar months, when her work hours were computed, including overtime for the time \nshe worked there, it amounted to more than one year\u2019s worth of work. She was told by \nHR that the debt should not be a problem. Apparently her former company did not see it \nthat way, and filed a lawsuit seeking recoupment of the funds. After the fact, Applicant \nlearned that her daughter, who was staying at Applicant\u2019s house, was served with process \non her mother\u2019s behalf. Her daughter failed to tell Applicant about being served or give \nher the paperwork. As a result, Applicant failed to appear for the court date and a default \njudgment was entered against her in February or March 2019. Upon receiving the \njudgment, the creditor executed a garnishment against Applicant\u2019s wages. The judgment \nwas satisfied in April 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 33-34; GE 2; AE C) \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant admitted that she had some earlier financial \ndelinquencies that resulted in the issuance of an SOR in approximately 2015. That SOR \nwas withdrawn when Applicant provided sufficient evidence showing that she had \nresolved or was resolving the debts. Since this information was not alleged in the current \nSOR, I will not use this evidence for disqualifying purposes, but I may use it in assessing \nApplicant\u2019s credibility, the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and during my whole-\nperson analysis. (Tr. 36) \nApplicant was also asked about her plan to pay her student-loan debt of \napproximately $40,000, which is currently deferred under the COVID-relief executive \norder. She provided a written budget that shows that between her and her husband, they \nhave approximately $5,000 remaining each month after paying all their obligations and \ndebts. This includes budgeting for a $500 per month student-loan payment. They recently \npurchased a home and they have about $67,000 in savings. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s net \nincome is approximately $4,200 monthly and hers is approximately $5,200 monthly.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred two unpaid consumer debts, had a car repossessed resulting in \na deficiency balance, and was required to pay a judgment to a former employer for an \neducational debt. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s generosity and enablement of family members contributed to her \nfinancial problems. With the help of her husband, she understands that she can no longer \nhelp family members that let her down. She resolved the educational debt through wage \ngarnishment before the issuance of the SOR, and she resolved the two minor consumer \ndebts. The car repossession deficiency was resolved through a cancellation of debt that \nshe will claim as income on her tax return. Applicant\u2019s current financial status, based upon \nboth her and her husband\u2019s income, is such that it is unlikely that she will be placed in \nthis position in the future. All the above mitigating conditions have some applicability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s long contractor service while holding a clearance, the \ncircumstances surrounding her indebtedness, and her efforts to resolve the delinquent \ndebts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

(GX 1; Tr. 35) \nIn May 2009, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to renew \nhis eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his military duties. The ensuing \nbackground investigation revealed that he owed about $22,000 for 23 delinquent or past-\ndue debts. In January 2011, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) revoked his clearance; however, Applicant appealed that decision, \nexplaining that his financial problems arose from circumstances beyond his control. He \nalso provided information showing that he acted responsibly in the face of those \ncircumstances by obtaining financial counseling and establishing a debt repayment plan. \nIn May 2011, his clearance was reinstated with the condition that he continue to meet his \nfinancial obligations and avoid incurring any new delinquent debts. (GX 3; Tr. 20, 36 \u2013 \n37) \nOn March 24, 2020, pursuant to Applicant\u2019s most recent application for clearance \nin January 2020 (GX 1), government investigators obtained a credit report (GX 4) that \ndocumented all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant had not disclosed any of those \ndebts as required in Section 26 of his e-QIP. On April 6, 2020, a government investigator \nconducted a personal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant that covered, in relevant part, \nhis finances. During the interview, the investigator conducted \u201croutine financial related \nquestioning,\u201d in response to which Applicant volunteered that he had one delinquent debt \nthat he had paid off. He was then confronted with the information contained in the March \n2020 credit report. Applicant has denied any intent to falsify his omission of adverse \nfinancial information from his most recent e-QIP (or in the PSI, for that matter). At his \nhearing, he explained in a credible way that he thought the Section 26 question on his \nmost recent e-QIP, as well as the investigator\u2019s questioning, sought information about \ndebts in addition to those he either had previously disclosed on another SCA he submitted \nin 2015 or 2016 (not part of this record), or that he knew were in his credit history and \nknown to investigators. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 10 \u2013 11, 40 \u2013 48) \nAs to the specific allegations of debt in the SOR, the record establishes the \nfollowing: \nApplicant disputed the amount of the $20,170 debt at SOR 1.a, claiming he owed \nonly about $7,000. After the PSI in 2020, he negotiated with the creditor and settled the \ndebt. Applicant further claimed that he even received a $3,000 refund as part of the \nsettlement. The debt does not appear on any credit report after March 2020. This debt is \nresolved. (Answer; GX 2; GX 4 \u2013 6; Tr. 61 \u2013 64) \nA credit report obtained on February 18, 2022, shows that the debt at SOR 1.b is \nnow being paid as required. It is a line of credit from Applicant\u2019s credit union for which he \ndid not make payments between February and June 2020.

His \npost-hearing submissions also established that he resolved a separate account with the \nsame creditor through monthly $89 payments. The debt at SOR 1.b is resolved. (GX 4 \u2013 \n6; AX G; AX H; Tr. 64 \u2013 65) \nAvailable information about the SOR debts shows that Applicant has not taken any \naction to resolve the $10,924 debt at SOR 1.c. He did not provide any information about \nthis debt. It is not resolved. (Answer; Tr. 65 \u2013 66) \nApplicant had four Military Star credit accounts while he was in the military that \nwere delinquent when he retired. (SOR 1.d and SOR 1.i \u2013 1.k) He testified that his retired \npay was garnished at a monthly rate of $700 between September 2020 and April 2022. \nHe claims those debts have been satisfied and provided credit report information listing \nthem as paid collection accounts. Notwithstanding that these accounts were paid through \ninvoluntary garnishments, they are nonetheless resolved. (AX A; AX I; Tr. 66 \u2013 67) \nAs to the debts at SOR 1.e \u2013 1.h and 1.l, Applicant denied those allegations and \nclaims to have paid off those debts around the time he was applying for a loan to buy his \nhouse in late 2019 and early 2020. He has owned his home and paid the mortgage as \nrequired since February 2020. Only one of those debts (SOR 1.l for $114) appears in any \nof the credit reports after March 2020. I conclude that these debts are resolved. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 2; GX 4 \u2013 6) \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems manifested by multiple past-due \nor delinquent debts. The debts that were the subject of the information presented in GX \n3, a 2010 adjudication of his clearance eligibility, arose mainly from the untimely death of \nhis father. That event resulted in financial hardship because Applicant had to take custody \nof his two younger brothers. Thereafter, his mother died, and both of his brothers died. \nThese events occurred as his first marriage was ending. When he divorced his first wife \nin 2012, he incurred a monthly child support obligation of $1,600, which he paid as an \nallotment from his active duty pay. In 2012, he also incurred a monthly child support \nobligation of $645 for a child born to a different woman after his first divorce. At the time, \nhe was a staff sergeant (E-6) and the $2,245 total child support payment equated to about \n75 percent of his monthly pay. He also incurred travel expenses to see his children who \nlived, at that time, on the opposite coast of the United States from where he was stationed. \n(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 27 \u2013 32, 34 \u2013 35, 48, 80) \nIn connection with the 2010 clearance adjudication, Applicant obtained \nprofessional debt-resolution assistance and established a debt repayment plan starting \nin September 2010 at $290 a month. When Applicant remarried in July 2015, his new \nwife\u2019s income helped him further improve his finances and his money management \npractices. However, he again had difficulty paying his bills when a few months after he \nleft the Marine Corps, his second marriage ended in divorce, and he was unemployed \nfrom November 2018 until going to work for his current employer in June 2019.

(GX 3; GX 4; \nTr. 36 \u2013 40) \nIn early 2021, Applicant\u2019s first wife and their children moved in with him. This has \nreduced his monthly child support obligation to $645 for his one child from outside his \nmarriages. Applicant brings home about $5,000 each month in regular pay. He also \nreceives $2,300 in military retired pay and $4,100 in monthly disability benefits from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA). In about June 2022, he started a trucking and \ndelivery business under the auspices of a state small business program that provides \nfunding and business management resources. Applicant\u2019s business appears to be doing \nwell as he testified he had a profit of nearly $30,000 in November 2022. To his credit, he \nis not yet taking income from the business, choosing instead to redirect his profits to \npaying company debt and growing his business capabilities. As to his personal finances, \nApplicant has not incurred any new past-due or delinquent debts. He meets all of his \ncurrent regular obligations, and after expenses each month, he has about $5,000 \nremaining, most of which he directs to his business. (Tr. 33, 49 \u2013 60, 69 \u2013 77) \nAt hearing, Department Counsel asked Applicant about more recent debts \nreflected in the February 2022 credit report admitted as GX 6. Applicant explained those \naccounts pertain to his new business. For example, he has several loans or credit \naccounts opened to procure vehicles for his business. None of those accounts are listed \nas past due or delinquent. He also presented information post-hearing that shows he \nrecently has paid off an auto loan as required. (AX B; Tr. 69 \u2013 70) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent \ndebts. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \nthat is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, \nin that, they continued unaddressed until after his PSI in April 2020. They are multiple \nand his largest remaining debt (SOR 1.c) remains unresolved without much explanation. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. As part of the 2010 adjudication of his financial problems, \nApplicant resolved his earlier debts through a debt repayment plan. After 2012, more \nfinancial problems arose while he was in the military and incurred significant child support \nobligations that equated to most of his monthly income. He also had to care for two \nsiblings after his parents died, and he went through another divorce. After retiring from \nthe military, he was unemployed for several months. After his first wife and their children \nmoved in with him, he was able to resolve most of his debts and reduce his child support \nobligation, which was still a large part of his monthly expenses. Since then, he has \nresolved most of his debts, and he started a small business that appears in its early stages \nto be thriving. In short, available information shows that Applicant has acted responsibly \nin the face of his earlier circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies, in part, based on Applicant\u2019s earlier engagement with a debt \nresolution company, and, in part, through his use of a small business program that is \nguiding him through the startup of his business. Rather than take unnecessary risks to \nearn extra income, it appears Applicant is approaching that endeavor methodically and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconservatively; for example, by deferring income in favor of reinvesting profits in the \nbusiness. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e \u2013 1.h, and 1.l. The Military \nStar accounts are resolved; however, that was accomplished through involuntary \ngarnishment of Applicant\u2019s military retired pay. Although SOR 1.c remains unresolved, I \nconclude it is likely he will address it as his business grows. \nIn addition to the documents supporting the SOR allegations, the Government \npresented information in GX 3 that was not alleged. Also discussed at hearing were recent \ndebts Applicant has accrued. I have not considered that information as possibly \ndisqualifying under this guideline. Nonetheless, it is probative of the applicability of these \nmitigating conditions. I also considered the information in Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmissions, some of which does not address any of the debts alleged in the SOR, but \nmay have some bearing on my assessment of Applicant\u2019s financial condition. The \nforegoing shows that Applicant had financial problems in 2010, which reasonably \nconcerns the Government in view of his more recent debts; however, it also shows he \ntook action to correct those problems. Applicant established that he has addressed most \nof the debts alleged in the SOR. As to the recent debts about which Department Counsel \nexamined Applicant at hearing, that information shows that they are associated with his \nbusiness, and he is meeting those obligations as required. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s current finances are sound and do not reflect adversely on his \njudgment or reliability. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nestablished by the Government\u2019s information. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern addressed through this guideline is articulated at AG \u00b6 15 as \nfollows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant intentionally provided false answers to the e-QIP \nSection 26 questions about his debts. It is not disputed that he did not list in his e-QIP \nany of the past-due debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) requires that, to be disqualifying, it \nwould have to be shown that his omissions were intentional. \nApplicant denied SOR 2.a. Accordingly, the burden of establishing that he intended \nto mislead by his negative answers remained with the Government (see Directive, \nE3.1.14). The Government\u2019s information showed that Applicant knew he had delinquent \ndebts within the meaning of the e-QIP questions at issue, and that he had previously \ncompleted a similar security clearance application. Based on this, the Government\u2019s \nposition was that he knew or should have known what information he was required to \ndisclose, and that he knowingly decided to withhold it. In response, Applicant\u2019s testimony \nregarding his intent showed he thought the Government already knew about his debts \nbecause he had disclosed them on an earlier clearance application in 2015 or 2016. Thus, \nhe thought he only had to disclose new delinquencies, which he believed did not exist. \nAs with the rest of Applicant\u2019s testimony, I found credible his claims that he did not \nintend to falsify his answers or otherwise mislead the Government about his financial \nproblems. Without that intent, his e-QIP answers are not disqualifying, and AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nnot established. The security concerns alleged by the Government under this guideline \nare not established. \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). I note that his circumstances have improved, both personally and financially. I also \nhave considered his honorable service in the Marines over 20 years. Available information \nshows that, despite the continued presence of an unresolved debt, Applicant has acted \nresponsibly in resolving his delinquent debts and improving his finances overall. The \nrecord evidence as a whole supports a fair and commonsense decision in favor of \nApplicant. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she did not expressly admit or deny the allegations, but she claimed that she had filed all her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2020. Her response amounts to a denial. Applicant is a 62-year-old marine painter employed by a defense contractor since January 2018. She received her high school diploma in January 1993. She has been employed by her current employer since 2003 (Tr. 27) Her SCA reflects that she was unemployed from June 2009 to January 2010, March to May 2011, March and April 2015, November 2015 to May 2016, and September and October 2017. These periods of unemployment occurred between the days that a contract ended and a new contract began. (Tr. 18) She received unemployment compensation during the gaps between contracts. (Tr. 23) She has never married. She has two adult children. She has never held a security clearance. When Applicant submitted her SCA in August 2018, she disclosed that she had not filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 because she \u201cdidn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t have the money\u201d if she owed taxes.

I informed her that I would reschedule the \nhearing. \nRescheduling of Applicant\u2019s hearing was delayed when she went on medical leave \non February 16, 2023. Due to complications after surgery, she remained on extended \nmedical leave until early September 2023. \nOn September 13, 2023, DOHA notified Applicant that her hearing would be \nconducted by video teleconference on October 11, 2023. I conducted the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until October 31, 2023, to enable her to submit additional \nevidence. She timely submitted AX G through J, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 20, 2023. The record closed on October \n31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she did not expressly admit or deny the \nallegations, but she claimed that she had filed all her federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 through 2020. Her response amounts to a denial. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old marine painter employed by a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2018. She received her high school diploma in January 1993. She has been \nemployed by her current employer since 2003 (Tr. 27) Her SCA reflects that she was \nunemployed from June 2009 to January 2010, March to May 2011, March and April 2015, \nNovember 2015 to May 2016, and September and October 2017. These periods of \nunemployment occurred between the days that a contract ended and a new contract \nbegan. (Tr. 18) She received unemployment compensation during the gaps between \ncontracts. (Tr. 23) She has never married. She has two adult children. She has never held \na security clearance. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SCA in August 2018, she disclosed that she had \nnot filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 because she \u201cdidn\u2019t \nor wouldn\u2019t have the money\u201d if she owed taxes. She stated that she was seeking credit \ncounseling. (GX 1 at 39-40) When she filed her federal tax return for 2015 in March 2018, \nit reflected a refund of $1,478.

She estimated that her federal tax liability was $1,268 for tax years 2016 and \n2017, and her state tax liability was $626 for tax year 2017. (GX 2 at 5-7) \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted documentary evidence that she filed her \nfederal and state returns for 2015 in March 2018, and she filed her federal and state \nreturns for 2016 through 2019 at various dates in 2021. (AX A through D; AX I) She paid \nthe balance due for federal taxes on a date not reflected in the record. (AX F) She paid \nthe balance due for state taxes in June 2023. (AX G) \nApplicant did not file her tax returns for 2021 until February or March 2023. She \ntestified that her parents passed away, and because of the stress of losing her parents, \nshe did not file her 2021 returns until she filed her 2022 tax returns. (Tr. 40) Her untimely \nfiling of her 2021 returns was not alleged in the SOR, and I have considered it for the \nlimited purpose of evaluating her evidence of mitigation and in my whole-person analysis. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, who has known her for more than 20 years, strongly \nrecommends that her application for a security clearance be granted. He states that she \nhas always demonstrated a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and dedication. (AX J) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence in this case establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file her state and federal \nincome tax returns are recent, numerous, and did not occur under circumstances making \nrecurrence likely. Her failure to timely file her tax returns for 2021, although not alleged in \nthe SOR, demonstrates the likelihood of recurrence. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant has experienced repeated periods of \nunemployment resulting from gaps between contracts. Most of the gaps were relatively \nshort, but some, e.g., June 2009 to January 2010 and November 2015 to May 2016 were \nsubstantial. However, she has not acted responsibly. She failed to timely file her returns \neven when she expected refunds. She did not file her returns for tax years 2015 through \n2019 until January 2021, after she was interviewed by a security investigator in June 2019 \nand responded to DOHA interrogatories in January 2020. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant filed the past-due tax returns in January 2021 \nand has paid the past-due federal and state taxes. \nThe fact that Applicant has filed her past-due returns does not preclude careful \nconsideration of her security worthiness based on her longstanding prior behavior. ISCR \nCase No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). A security clearance adjudication is not a \ntax collection process. Nor is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. \nRather, it is an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). Applicant did not take her tax obligations seriously until \nrealized that her tax delinquencies were an impediment to obtaining a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec.

I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.\u201d \nApplicant was convicted in 2004 of misdemeanor harassment and in 2019 of \nmisdemeanor disorderly conduct.

The circumstances surrounding his 2015 discharge \nfrom the U.S. military happened under unusual circumstances involving his ex-spouse, \nwith whom he has since become friends and is committed to raising their daughter and \nunborn child. Almost four years have passed since his 2019 arrest for misdemeanor \ndisorderly conduct. He was candid and sincere at the hearing, he accepted \nresponsibility, and he was remorseful for his criminal involvement. He reported the 2019 \nincident to his supervisor and security manager and discussed it during his 2019 \nbackground interview, and he disclosed information about his 2004 conviction and 2015 \ndischarge on his SCAs. He has a favorable employment record with his current \nemployer, to include yearly performance-based promotions since 2018 and his direct \nsupervisor\u2019s attestation to Applicant\u2019s stellar performance and notable personal growth \nand maturity.

AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \u00b6 AG 17 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, I find that \u00b6\u00b6 \nAG 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are established. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant was candid and \nsincere at the hearing, he accepted responsibility, and he was remorseful for his \ncriminal involvement. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden \nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nhis security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s evidence establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are long-standing, \nongoing, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s reduction in income when he joined \nthe Army in 2008, a short period of unemployment in 2016 after completing his active \nArmy service, and his marital separation were conditions largely beyond his \ncontrol.

He submitted no evidence of financial counseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, \nwhich are resolved. It is not established for the other debts alleged in the SOR. The child-\nsupport arrearages alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c are being paid by involuntary payroll \ndeductions pursuant to court order or tax refund interception, which are not the equivalent \nof good-faith payments. See ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were already \naddressed, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, employment history, favorable character \nletters, and his honorable military service including his deployment to Afghanistan, military \nmedals and awards. I considered that he has resolved two delinquent accounts totaling \n$4,910, had reduced his child support arrearages by at least $14,042 prior to his hearing, \nwas on schedule to pay all arrearages alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b in 2023, and expected to pay \nall past due child support within five years. \nHowever, his apparent irresponsibility in providing sufficient child support for three \nof his children resulted in court-ordered garnishment of his pay in 2007, 2015 and 2019, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nand the $64,826 in arrearages alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. The reduction in the past-due \nchild-support was attributable to involuntary withholdings, and mostly to a court-order \nrequiring the entire withholding for CH1\u2019s support be applied to past-due child support \nafter CH1 was emancipated in October 2021. At hearing, Applicant still owed \napproximately $50,000 in past-due child support. \nThe Government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to \nproperly safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such \ninformation. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an \napplicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of \npersons handling classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0188 (App. Bd. Apr. \n29, 1999). Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security. Directive, Enclosure 2, App. A \n\u00b6 2(b).  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old aviation mechanic employed by a defense contractor \nsince July 2005. (Item 2 at 7, 13.) He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 2 \nat 32.) He married in October 1995 and divorced in May 1998.

Applicant admitted in his Answer to being arrested and charged with possession \nof marijuana. In his SCA he admitted to pleading guilty to possession of a controlled \nsubstance and noted that the possession of marijuana charge was dropped. He stated in \nhis SCA that \u201cthere is a plea of guilty as I was not allowed to plead no contest.\u201d (Item 2 at \n27-28.) He was sentenced to 18 months of community supervision, to participate in 50 \nhours of community service, and pay a fine of $968. (Item 2 at 26, 27, 28, and 29.) He \nstated in his background interview he did not know the entirety of what he was charged \nwith possessing but then admitted he pled guilty because he was advised he was \nfortunate to not have a felony charge. (Item 3 at 5-6.) He states in his SCA this charge \nwas false and the person who accused him of sexual assault could not recant this offense \nbecause they could risk being charged with a crime. (Item 2 at 37.) \nApril 2017 use and/or possession of marijuana with vary frequency while\ngranted access to classified information (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 4.a).\n \n Applicant pled guilty to \npossession of marijuana in his residence. (Item 2 at 9.) The police recovered a bag of \nmarijuana in plain view, along with a water bong in the master bedroom. The police \nrecovered a vaporizer bong hidden behind a closed master bathroom door.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as\ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in\nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or    \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted possessing marijuana in April 2017, the offense for which he \nwas arrested and charged.

Further, eligibility for access \nto classified information and the granting of access to classified information are not \nsynonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. The issuance of a security \nclearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for access to classified national \nsecurity information up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant \nan individual access to classified materials. In order to gain access to specific classified \nmaterials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also \nmust have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See Executive \nOrder 13526, dated December 29, 2009, at \u00a7 4.1.

Further, it is not established that he had access to classified \ninformation at the time. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply, and SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for \nApplicant. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n26 to SOR \u00b6 1.a: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nState law enforcement executed a search of Applicant\u2019s home and arrested him \nbased upon allegations of aggravated assault and sexual assault from the woman who \nresided in his home, as well as for possession of marijuana. The above disqualifying \ncondition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply for the same reasons set forth under Guidelines \nH (SOR \u00b6 1.a) above and E (SOR \u00b6 4.a) below. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is serious. \nHe has recent rehabilitative steps, but completing a treatment program, and court-ordered \ncommunity service and supervision are insufficient given the record evidence.

AG \u00b6 32(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe sexual assault charge, alleged as part of SOR \u00b6 2.b under Guideline J \n(criminal conduct) is cross-alleged under Guideline D as sexual conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.a). \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n14: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nState law enforcement arrested Applicant based on the allegations of the woman \nhe lived with.

Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and \n4.b. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 4.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s two arrests (alleged under other guidelines, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas noted above) as a personal conduct security concern as well. Applicant\u2019s conduct \nreflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nIt also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \ntherefore applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under other guidelines. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in the general personal conduct security concern of AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 is established. \nSOR \u00b6 4.b alleges that Applicant failed to fully disclose the April 2017 incident as \nrequired by National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, Chapter 1, Section \n3, paragraph i-300 to his security officer. In order to find against him under this specific \nquestion, the Government must prove by substantial evidence that he intentionally failed \nto report. The record reflects he did report the incidents and supplemented his initial report \nshortly after his initial meeting to address a concern he had omitted certain information. \nThe Government did not prove that he intentionally misled the security officer. There is \ninsufficient evidence to establish the specific question alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.b. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(b) are not applicable to that question. SOR \u00b6 4.b. is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 4.c alleges that Applicant failed to disclose material facts on his SCA in \n\u201cfailing to disclose\u201d that he used marijuana or was otherwise \u201cinvolved\u201d with a drug or \ncontrolled substance while in possession of a security clearance. Applicant denied using \nmarijuana in April 2017, the time of his marijuana-related arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and he \ndisclosed the arrest itself on his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established and SOR \u00b6 4.c. is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nIn order to mitigate SOR \u00b6 4.a, Applicant has the burden of establishing one or \nmore of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) may have some \napplicability. They provide: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant acknowledges his arrests and charges but denies the \nunderlying conduct despite pleading guilty. He accepted the state\u2019s plea agreement to \navoid a felony charge. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable. \nThe relevant issue under AG \u00b6 17(d) is whether those steps are sufficient to \nreasonably conclude that the behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant denies the underlying \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct despite pleading guilty. He was prompted by the interviewing investigator to \nacknowledge the drugs and drug paraphernalia recovered in his house. He states he only \npled guilty because he could not plead no contest. He has not expressed remorse. It is \ndifficult to find that he is fully rehabilitated when he refuses to accept responsibility for his \nactions. The personal conduct security concerns are not fully mitigated. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not \napplicable. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for criminal conduct, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, J, D, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Applicant blamed his accuser for the drugs found in his \nhouse. He pled guilty to possession of marijuana in his residence. The amount of \nmarijuana and the locations of the marijuana and the drug paraphernalia found throughout \nhis home show his statements about the marijuana and the drug paraphernalia belonging \nto someone else lack credibility. His initial denial of knowledge of any drugs in his home \nuntil the interviewing agent asked about the drugs found in plain view further \ndemonstrates a lack of sincerity. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, J, \nD, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.b-c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances.

The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further inquiry is necessary about the potential \napplication of any mitigation conditions. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance\nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th\nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The\nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in\nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are partially applicable. His 2015 divorce and current \ndivorce no doubt played a role in his inability to remain current on his established \nobligations at that time. However, Applicant does not receive full credit under either of \nthese two mitigating conditions because of his failure to act responsibly under the \ncircumstances and the time elapsed before addressing his debts and tax obligations. \nAG 20(c) does not apply. Applicant receives some credit for retaining the services of a \nfinancial counseling service in May 2022. However, such an arrangement was made on \nthe eve of his hearing; and by his own admission he does not have the necessary funds \nto implement the recommended plan of financial recovery. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Although Applicant made payment arrangements with \nthe IRS in April 2013 to repay his 2012 tax debt, he stopped making those payments in \nFebruary 2014 because he chose to allocate available funds to other priorities. \nApplicant\u2019s prediction that his 2012 tax debt will be satisfied out of anticipated refunds \nfrom income tax returns that he filed late may well be the case, but at this point it is too \nspeculative to view his IRS debt as resolved. Such a payment resolution for a 2012 tax \ndebt is not timely. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not relevant. \nOf great concern is the fact that Applicant did not timely file his Federal income \ntax returns for 2012, 2016, 2017, and 2018. He claimed to have filed those returns on \nthe eve of his hearing date; however, what he provided were unsigned and undated \nincome tax returns for those years, which do not establish that they were filed. As noted, \nApplicant was alerted to the fact that his failure to file these returns was a concern to the \nGovernment during his May 2020 OPM PSI, and when he received his February 2021 \nSOR and DOHA Interrogatories. These events apparently did not prompt Applicant to \nrecognize the seriousness of his situation and take immediate corrective action. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, he did not provide a plausible explanation for failing to file his Federal \nincome tax returns. With regard to his 2013 Federal income tax return, he referred to a \nnon-cooperative spouse; however, that explanation hardly justifies a nine-year delay in \nfiling. Moreover, he claims to have filed his income returns on the eve of his hearing. \nEven if they were filed shortly before his hearing, this would not be enough to mitigate \nsecurity concerns regarding his dilatory filing of his tax returns. \nSuch a lapse in judgment cannot be overlooked, especially from an individual \nwhose income is derived from tax dollars. The evidence demonstrates that Applicant did \nnot act responsibly with regard to timely filing his Federal income tax returns and paying \nor making payment arrangements for taxes owed. \nApplicant failed to file timely his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, \n2016, 2017, and 2018. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the \nIRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . .. \nA willful failure to make a return, keep records, or supply information when \nrequired, is a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. \nUnited States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. \n1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, \n51 F.2d 193 (7th  Cir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to timely file his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. \nConcerning the failure to timely file Federal income tax returns when due, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the \nAnalysis section under Guideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. \nHowever, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is a 50-year-old forensics analyst, systems engineer, and \nnetwork engineer, who has been employed by a defense contractor since August 2013. \nHe has spent the majority of his adult working life initially on active duty and later as a \ncivilian employee in support of the defense industry. He has successfully held a \nclearance since 1990, apart for a brief period when he was in the Army National Guard. \nHe seeks to retain his Top Secret security clearance, which is a requirement of his \ncontinued employment. He is well regarded by his employer. Applicant is currently \nseparated, and going through his third divorce. He has two adult children from his \nsecond marriage. He has all the indicators of an upwardly mobile individual with a bright \nfuture ahead of him. \nHowever, for at least nine years, he has failed to grasp the importance of one of \nthe fundamental hallmarks of U.S. citizenship, which is the timely filing of his Federal \nincome tax returns and paying taxes when due. This is especially crucial for an \nindividual seeking to retain a security clearance and who works for a defense contractor \n13 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadvancing the national security of the United States. From the evidence presented, \ndespite being made aware that the timely filing of his Federal income tax returns was a \nsecurity concern, Applicant failed to comply with this basic and fundamental civic \nobligation. He also neglected his obligation to numerous other creditors. \nHe is a bright and talented individual, who is more than capable of addressing his \nincome tax problems in a responsible way. Hopefully in the near future, Applicant will \nview the outcome of this decision as motivation to address these concerns and achieve \nthe level of financial stability required to regain national security eligibility. This decision \nshould not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the \nstate of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. With more \neffort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n \u2013 1.o: \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n  Subparagraph 1.g: \n Subparagraph 1.l: \n   Subparagraph 1.m: \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

She had \ntwo adult stepchildren, both of whom are deceased. She claimed that she has held a \nsecurity clearance since 1997. (Items 3-5) \nThe SOR alleges untimely filed federal and state tax returns for the 2014 through \n2019 tax years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); delinquent federal taxes totaling $19,355 for the \n2014 tax year (SOR \u00b6 1.c); delinquent taxes to State A for the 2014 tax year in the \namount of $8,219 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); delinquent taxes to State A for the 2018 tax year in the \namount of $2,753 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a county tax lien for $238 entered in 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a \n2018 judgment for $2,619 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a wage garnishment in 2017 for $2,711 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h); and a delinquent telecommunications debt for $1,163 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). In her SOR \nresponse, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. The SOR \nallegations are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \nevidence. (Items 1, 3-8) \nApplicant claimed that there are several reasons for her financial difficulties, \nincluding her failure to timely file and pay federal, state, and local taxes. She claimed \nthat her husband suffers from a drug addiction, has undergone drug treatment \ncounseling, and spent six months in prison in 2018. She also claimed that he mentally \nabused her in an unspecified manner. Her stepdaughter passed away in 2018 and her \nstepson was murdered in late 2021. She was out of work for about eight months \nbetween 2017 and 2018 and for about a year between 2021 and 2022 because she was \nrecovering from back surgeries. She also claimed that she financially supports her two \nchildren and two grandchildren. (Items 3-5) \nThere is documentary evidence that Applicant filed her 2016 federal and State A \nincome tax returns in about May 2021. Also, there is documentary evidence that \nApplicant filed her 2019 federal income tax return in about August 2020. Finally, there is \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant filed her 2020 federal and State A income tax \nreturns in about May 2021. The delinquent income tax returns listed in the SOR that \nApplicant eventually filed were all filed after she submitted her Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) and had her security interview. (Item 5) \nThere is no evidence that the IRS or State A granted Applicant a filing extension \nfor any of the tax years relevant to the SOR. The documents reflect that she consulted \nwith a professional tax filing service in order to file these tax returns. Applicant claimed \nthat she would file all of her late income tax returns in 2020, however, there is no \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant has yet filed her 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 \nfederal and State A income tax returns. Also, there is no documentary evidence that \nApplicant has filed her 2019 State A income tax return.

She provided no documentary evidence \nto show that these taxes were paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. (Items 1, 3-5) \nThe $8,219 tax debt to State A alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was resolved involuntarily \nthrough a wage garnishment in 2017 and 2018.

She claimed that she has been working overtime in order to pay \nthe debt more quickly. She provided no documentary evidence to show that these taxes \nwere paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. (Items 1, 3, 5, 6, 8) \nThe $238 lien entered on behalf of County B alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f has not been \nresolved. Applicant admitted this debt and claimed that she will pay it. However, she \nprovided no documentary evidence to show that this lien was satisfied, disputed, or \notherwise resolved.

(Items 1, \n3, 8) \nThe 2018 wage garnishment for overdraft fees for $2,711 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h \nhas been resolved. Applicant admitted this allegation. She provided no documentary \nevidence to show that this judgment was paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. \nHowever, there is no evidence in the record that this garnishment remains in place or is \nongoing. (Items 1, 3, 8) \nThe $1,163 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i has not been resolved. \nApplicant admitted this debt. She provided no documentary evidence to show that this \ndebt was paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. This debt does not appear in the May \n2022 credit report. (Items 1, 3, 4) \nApplicant anticipates that she will incur an additional approximately $10,000 in \nlate federal and state taxes once she files her unfiled tax returns. She claimed that she \nwill make arrangements to pay these taxes at that time. Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM, so more recent information about her finances is not available.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She untimely filed several years of \nfederal and state income tax returns and has not filed required federal and state income \ntax returns for several other tax years. She has delinquent federal and state taxes and \nother consumer debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThere is sufficient evidence that the issues alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h have \nbeen resolved. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to those two SOR allegations.\n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has suffered from many unforeseen setbacks ranging from unfortunate \nto tragic. Many of these issues were clearly beyond her control. However, none of these \nissues can reasonably excuse her failure to comply with her tax filing obligations over \nsuch an extended period of time. Likewise, these issues did not cause her to fail to \nwithhold a sufficient portion of income to meet her tax burden. Even if one were to \nassume for the sake of argument that these issues were directly responsible for her \nfailure to file and pay her taxes as required, she would still need to show that she has \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. She has failed to do so because she \nprovided insufficient evidence of any efforts she has made to remedy her remaining \ndelinquent tax filing and payment obligations. \nWhile Applicant has remedied some of her late tax return filings and has paid \nsome of her delinquent SOR debts through offsets and involuntary garnishments, she \nbegan these efforts after being put on notice that her failure on these fronts might \ninterfere with her ability to maintain a security clearance. An applicant who begins to \nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Court-ordered or otherwise involuntary \nmeans of debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less weight than means \ninitiated and carried through by the debtor. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSep. 26, 2019).

However, as she still has \noutstanding late tax returns and tax debts, as well as other financial delinquencies, I am \nunable to find that the financial problems are under control or are being resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s state and federal tax and consumer debt issues are current and \nongoing. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with her federal tax obligations and to pay her \ndebts continues to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The security concerns arising out of the established SOR allegations are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered the many difficulties \nApplicant has encountered during her life. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

After the \ndivorce, his ex-wife repeatedly filed petitions regarding child support that caused him to \nretain an attorney to represent him in those proceedings, and the expenses kept \nincreasing, causing him to fall behind with his other financial obligations. In about June \n2011, he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, and in about September 2011, about \n$150,000 in debt was discharged. (Tr. at 19-23) There were no noticeable recurrent \nfinancial problems until about 2018-19. \nIn early 2019, Applicant\u2019s automobile broke down and he had to repeatedly send \nit to a repair shop for repairs, the costs for which were not covered by insurance and had \nto be paid out of pocket. Those expenses caused him to be delinquent on his mortgage. \nSeveral months later, one of his children sustained an injury and had to be hospitalized. \nFour of his children have been diagnosed with Autism. In January 2019, his diabetic wife \nwas diagnosed with lupus and fibromyalgia. On August 15, 2019, he entered into a debt \nresolution agreement with a company in an effort to resolve his debt. He listed 16 different \ncreditors with a total unpaid balance of $35,665 that were to be the focus of resolution \nefforts. Commencing on September 24, 2019, he agreed to pay the company a variety of \nmonthly fees, service fees, and a program fee totaling approximately $11,168 which came \nto approximately $537 per month for 48 months, ending in August 2023. (AE I) He has \nbeen in compliance with the repayment arrangements. (AE H; AE J) \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported a number of delinquent charged off consumer \naccounts. He noted that the accumulation of medical bills and car repairs coupled with \nthe rise in medical co-pays and living expenses resulted in monthly expenses being more \nthan his monthly take-home income. He said his wife had reentered the workforce \nresulting in a slight increase of monthly household income. (GE 1 at 47-58) He sought \ncredit counseling in an effort to resolve his revolving credit card debt and to assist him to \ncatch up on his health-related bills. (GE 1 at 45) \nOn June 25, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), and he confirmed that he had previously filed \nfor bankruptcy under Chapter 7 in June 2011 in an effort to resolve multiple credit-card \ndebt, auto loans, and medical expenses. He could not recall the amount discharged. (GE \n2 at 2) He also acknowledged that during 2018-19, because his wife was not working, he \nexperienced new financial issues with mounting medical expenses (approximately $400 \nper month) for his children and student-loan accounts.

Based on \nthe evidence presented, he is expected to fail meeting either goal. However, in an effort \nto more fully address his financial problems, Applicant has also routinely focused on \nvarious other (non-SOR) accounts and has successfully resolved them.

(AE G) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nIn about June 2011, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, and in about \nSeptember 2011, about $150,000 in debt was discharged. The SOR alleged 15 still \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $34,632, most of which became delinquent \nduring 2018-19. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c have been established, but there is no evidence \nthat Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and \nAG \u00b6 19 (b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. Applicant acknowledged having some \nfinancial issues as far back as 2011 when he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, \nessentially due to lingering divorce and child support issues with his ex-wife. Although he \nwas unemployed on two occasions, things stabilized financially after his bankruptcy \ndischarge until 2018-19 when a variety of automobile expenses and medical expenses \ndeveloped. Four of his children were diagnosed with Autism and his diabetic wife was \ndiagnosed with lupus and fibromyalgia. The accumulation of medical bills and car repairs \ncoupled with the rise in medical co-pays and living expenses resulted in monthly \nexpenses being more than his monthly take-home income. His wife reentered the \nworkforce resulting in a slight increase of monthly household income. He sought credit \ncounseling in an effort to resolve credit card debt and to assist him to catch up on his \nhealth-related bills. He focused on paying his medical bills and his wife\u2019s student loans \nwith the eventual intention of transitioning to his other delinquent accounts. \nOn August 15, 2019 \u2013 two years before the SOR was issued \u2013 Applicant entered \ninto a debt resolution agreement with a company in an effort to resolve his debt. He listed \n16 different creditors with a total unpaid balance of $35,665 that were to be the focus of \nresolution efforts. Commencing on September 24, 2019, he agreed to pay the company \na variety of monthly fees, service fees, and a program fee totaling approximately $11,168 \nwhich came to approximately $537 per month for 48 months, ending in August 2023. He \nhas been in compliance with the repayment arrangements. He also focused on non-SOR \naccounts and has successfully resolved them. He took out a $71,000 equity loan to help \npay off his debts. In October 2022, he reported a family net income of approximately \n$11,236 and approximately $7,597 in monthly expenses, as well as debt payments \ntotaling approximately $3,476, leaving a monthly remainder of approximately $163 \navailable for saving or spending. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant acted in a reasonable manner \nwhen dealing with the significant medical issues over which he had no control. Treatment \ncame first, followed by efforts to maintain his medical accounts current, something he \nappears to have been successful in doing as no medical accounts are delinquent. Two \nyears before the SOR was issued, he started the effort to address his other delinquent \naccounts. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith those financial difficulties.

Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant initially focused on the family medical bills before turning to their other bills. The \ntransition began in August 2019 and some SOR debts as well as other delinquent bills \nhave been resolved or are in the process of being resolved. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered \ndocumentary evidence to reflect his settlement program, the resolution of various \naccounts, and payments made. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is evidence of financial counseling and a budget. Applicant\u2019s aggressive \naction commencing two years before the SOR was issued, eliminates doubt regarding his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere \nis \nsome \ndisqualifying \nevidence \nregarding \nApplicant\u2019s \nfinancial \nconsiderations. In addition to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011, the SOR alleged 15 still-\ndelinquent accounts (most of which had been charged off) totaling approximately \n$34,632. Applicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status \nto several factors, described more fully above. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. \nHe has been serving as a systems analyst or subject matter expert with his current \nemployer originally from November 2012 until December 2014 and again since about \nSeptember 2015. A 1988 high school graduate, he received an associate degree in 2010, \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014, and a master\u2019s degree in 2018. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy \nin August 1988, and served on active duty until October 2011, when he was medically \ndischarged and honorably retired with a 50 percent disability rating from the VA. He was \ngranted a variety of security clearances (secret, top secret, and SCI since about 2005. \nHe remarried in 2001, and he has seven children. \nApplicant candidly reported financial issues in his SF 86, discussed them during \nhis OPM interview, and furnished documentary evidence regarding his efforts to resolve \nall of his delinquent debts, including some that were not alleged in the SOR. It is significant \nthat in August 2019, two years before the SOR was issued, he entered into a debt \nresolution program and started to resolve his accounts and repair his finances. Several \nnon-SOR as well as SOR accounts have either been resolved or in the process of being \nresolved. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the debts is \ngrowing and improving, and, considering the circumstances his family has been dealt, his \nefforts have been reasonable, positive, and encouraging. Overall, the evidence leaves \nme without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p.:  \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

(Tr. 61-64; SOR; Answer; GE 1-9) \nOver the last decade, Applicant and his wife had significant, often life-threatening \nhealth issues. In November 2013, Applicant tore his Achilles tendon and missed a \nmonth and a half of work. In 2014, Applicant\u2019s wife had heart issues, causing her to \nfaint. After about six months of missed diagnoses, doctors correctly diagnosed her \ncondition and inserted a pacemaker. Applicant and his wife lived in a remote area, so, \non three occasions, she had to be medevacked by helicopter to a hospital that had the \ncapability to treat her heart condition. As a result of this health issue, she lost her job \nand has not had a job that paid as much since. In 2015, Applicant\u2019s appendix burst. His \nheart stopped twice, but doctors were able to revive him. He was in a coma for 28 days. \nHe missed about 70 days of work. In 2017, his wife was once again medevacked to a \nhospital for what doctor\u2019s believed was a ruptured appendix, where she was treated for \nfive days. Each medevac flight cost tens of thousands of dollars that was not covered by \ninsurance. While these debts are not part of the SOR as they are his wife\u2019s, Applicant \nhas been using his income to pay them off. In August 2020, his wife was diagnosed with \nstage four lung cancer which required chemotherapy and radiation. She has been \nunable to work to contribute to the household finances since that cancer diagnosis. \nWhile he and his wife had health insurance throughout this time, the cost of uncovered \ntreatment, along with the ancillary costs of travel and missing work has overwhelmed \nthem.

He planned to \nuse the additional wages to pay his delinquent SOR debts. He began working his \ncurrent job in about August 2022. For the first five and a half months after he started his \nnew job he earned about $3,600 per month. He was living in a hotel in the U.S and was \nnot yet earning his overseas pay.

He claimed \nthat he has paid this debt. He claimed there is a miscommunication between the local \nand the national offices of this creditor whether he has paid this account. He provided \nno documents to corroborate this payment or his efforts to resolve his dispute. Applicant \nclaimed that he contacted the creditor of the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f a week before the \nDOHA hearing to make payment arrangements, but he could not reach an agreement \nwith them. On an unspecified date, he claimed he contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.t to \nattempt to resolve that debt. He claimed the debt was for satellite TV equipment that he \nclaimed he returned. He provided no documentation to corroborate his attempt to \nresolve this debt. However, based on his testimony, I find that he returned the \nequipment. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 49-58, 61-63) \nApplicant has three delinquent debts on his credit reports that are not listed in the \nSOR. In the last week, he contacted the creditor of two of these debts and one of these \ncreditors contacted him. He did not make any payment arrangements with these \ncreditors or otherwise resolve these debts. Any adverse information not alleged in the \nSOR, such as Applicant\u2019s additional financial delinquencies cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept.

Based upon this inaccurate information, he thought he had more time to \nresolve his financial delinquencies to avoid any ill effect on his security clearance. (Tr. \n70-72) \nApplicant provided a character reference letter from his work supervisor. His \nsupervisor opined that Applicant is honest, responsible, and reliable. He noted that \nApplicant does well at work and is very professional. He believes Applicant should be \ngranted a security clearance. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has 32 delinquent debts totaling about $16,500 that have been \ndelinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. The \nevidence does not show that the debts are resolved or are under control. He has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. I cannot find his financial issues are \nunlikely to recur. If he does as he has claimed and resolves his debts, he may be able \nto meet this mitigating condition in the future. However, his future intentions are \ninsufficient. I also note that despite earning about $20,000 in two months, he only has \nabout $2,300 in his bank accounts without paying toward his SOR debts. These \nbalances cause me to question his ability to meaningfully resolve his debts in a timely \nfashion. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his and his wife\u2019s serious health \nproblems. These conditions were clearly beyond his control and he and his wife have \ncertainly been dealt a bad hand. However, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must also show \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these debts. I \nrecognize he did not think he could make payment arrangements until after he made \nsufficient wages through his new job. I also recognize that he intends to resolve these \ndebts in the future because he now makes more money. However, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence to show that he could not make any payments on these debts before \nhis current employment. He still has not made any payments after earning about \n$20,000 in two months. He still has not resolved debts that he disputed. Given these \nconsiderations, he failed to provide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances and AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has not made payments on any of his SOR debts. There is evidence \nthat when he thought his clearance would not be affected, he was not motivated to \nresolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant disputed owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, 1.j, 1.s, and 1.t. He \nclaimed that he did not recognize the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.s. However, he did not \ncontact the creditor or credit reporting agencies to dispute those debts. He claimed that \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.j. However, he provided no documents to \ncorroborate any payments. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He claimed that he contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.t to \ndispute the account because he returned the creditor\u2019s equipment. While he has not \nprovided documented proof to substantiate the dispute, his claim that he does not owe \nthe debt because he returned the equipment is reasonable. His testimony that he \nreturned it and contacted the creditor is evidence of his action to resolve the issue. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.t, but not to any of the other SOR allegations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his positive character reference. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.u-1.ff  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. Her fourth husband was \noccasionally unemployed and irresponsible, which caused financial problems. Applicant \nhad serious medical problems, including brain surgery. Applicant had periods of \nunderemployment and unemployment. She is currently providing financial assistance for \nher daughter and grandchild. These circumstances were beyond her control, and they \nadversely affected her finances. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially \narose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge \ncould still consider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

She is credited \nwith filing her tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2018 around October 22, 2020, and \nestablishing a payment plan with the IRS. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant is credited with mitigating SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.j. She paid the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h through 1.j, and she is making payments on her medical debts. Applicant has an \nestablished payment plan for her Federal income tax debt. She has a plan to address her \ndebts, a budget, and she is making progress addressing her debts. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file her TY 2013 Federal income tax return was based on \nadvice from her tax counselor. However, Applicant failed to obtain agreement from the \nIRS that filing this tax return was unnecessary. She failed to timely file her Federal income \ntax returns for TYs 2014 through 2018. She said she might not have filed those tax returns \nif she had not been alerted that it was a problem for her security clearance. \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a Federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful \nfailure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile her Federal income tax returns against her as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile Federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nFederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file Federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016), the applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 Federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 Federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received Federal income tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant him \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests.

Under all the circumstances, \nshe failed to establish full mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old regulatory documentation specialist who has been \nemployed by a DOD contractor since May 2020. She attended career college from 1988 \nto 1989 to become a paralegal. Her most recent marriage ended in divorce in 2019. \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. She \nprovided multiple reasons for her financial difficulties. Aside from her failure to timely file \nher Federal income tax returns for TYs 2013 through 2018, she has done a good job \npaying her creditors and maintaining her financial responsibility. I found her statement at \nher hearing and in her post-hearing emails to be credible. She is a patriotic American, \nand this decision has absolutely no bearing on her loyalty. There is no evidence to \nsuggest that she would betray her country. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not establish that she was unable to make greater progress sooner filing \nher Federal income tax returns for TYs 2013 through 2018.

See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to fully mitigate financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of timely filing her Federal income \ntax returns and a better record of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well \nbe able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

He has not filed a police report with respect to \nany of the SOR debts. He claimed that since 2017, he and his wife have been \nseparating their finances and that they \u201cdon\u2019t talk finances.\u201d He believed that his wife \nhad contacted some of the creditors of the SOR debts that he thinks she opened in his \nname but he was not sure.

He claimed that he is responsible for paying for his mortgage and the \nutilities. He claimed his wife pays the monthly payment for a truck that is in his name \nbecause his wife could not qualify for the credit necessary to purchase it. He financed \nthis truck for his wife in 2021 despite telling a security investigator in June 2020 that he \nwould not cosign for her for financing. The purchase price of this truck was about \n$41,000 and the monthly payments are $732. Applicant also recently paid $17,000 for a \ncamper. The monthly payment on the camper is $300. He purchased a home in June \n2022 for $369,000. The monthly mortgage payment is $2,600. He purchased a vehicle \nin 2021 for $22,000. His monthly payment on that vehicle is $450. He has not taken any \ncredit counseling. (Tr. 42-44, 49, 57-60; GE 5) \nApplicant claimed he takes home $7,620 in income from his wages, military \nservice disability, and military retirement. His wife brings home about $1,100 per week \nin wages. He has about $1,500 in his savings account and saves $1,700 to $1,800 \nevery month.

(Tr. 51-54, 56-57; GE 5) \nApplicant claimed that he did not disclose any financial delinquencies on his SCA \nbecause he was either unaware of the accounts that he believed his wife opened in his \nname without his knowledge, or because he did not understand that he was responsible \nfor debts that were charged off. However, he reviewed a credit report in April 2019 that \nlisted delinquent accounts prior to filling out his SCA. He also admitted that he \nsuspected that he had outstanding financial delinquencies when he filled out the SCA, \nand that his 2017 separation was partly attributable to financial issues caused by his \nwife\u2019s overspending.

(Tr. 20, 44-49; GE 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has had consumer financial delinquencies for at least five years. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.j through payment prior to \nthe issuance of the SOR. I find in favor of Applicant with respect to those allegations. \nThe allegation contained in SOR \u00b6 1.e was not established. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor \nwith respect to that allegation. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence that the other SOR debts are \nresolved. His financial issues are ongoing. To the extent that his wife is responsible for \nhis financial issues, the record is unclear as to whether her overspending or fraudulent \nuse of credit has ceased. I therefore cannot find his financial issues are unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of marital problems. They may have \nalso resulted to some extent from fraud perpetrated by his wife. These conditions were \nbeyond his control. However, to afford himself mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), he must \nalso show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these \ndebts. While he satisfied some of the SOR debts, most of the SOR debts have been \nunaddressed for years. Despite indicating he would take this step in 2020, he has not \ndisputed debts he claimed are not his with creditors or credit reporting agencies. He has \nnot provided sufficient evidence that he confronted his wife about the possibility that she \nfraudulently opened and used credit cards in his name. He has not filed a police report. \nDespite having these unresolved financial delinquencies, he further indebted himself \nwith the purchase of two vehicles, a camper, and a house. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant settled three of the SOR debts through payment prior to the issuance \nof the SOR. However, the majority of the SOR debts remain unaddressed. AG \u00b6 20(d) \npartially applies. \nApplicant claimed that several of the SOR debts were not his and he believed \nthat his wife might have fraudulently opened credit cards in his name. This claim forms \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the relevant past-due debts. However, to \navail himself of mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e), he must also either provide documented \nproof to substantiate this fraud or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue. He \nprovided no documents in this regard. Moreover, he did not dispute any potentially \nfraudulent debts with creditors or credit reporting agencies. He did not file a police \nreport.

AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nNone of the financial considerations mitigating factors is fully applicable. \nApplicant has not met his burden of establishing mitigation of the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant deliberately omitted derogatory information regarding his finances from \nhis SCA despite being required to divulge it. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 \n16(a). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not correct the omission of his derogatory financial information \nbefore being confronted with the facts. He only acknowledged his financial \ndelinquencies after the security investigator confronted him with them during his 2020 \nsecurity interview. \nFalsification of an SCA is not \u201cminor\u201d because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the \nsecurity clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). Given \nhis inconsistent and incredible testimony about his knowledge of his financial \ndelinquencies and the import of a financial charge off, he has not acknowledged his lack \nof truthfulness when he certified his SCA. He has not undergone counseling or provided \nevidence of other positive steps to change the behavior. His continued lack of candor \nabout his SCA omission during his testimony leaves me unable to find that this behavior \nis unlikely to recur. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable and the personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, and I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F \nand E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Item 2) Applicant, age 49, is divorced and does not have any children. \n(Item 3) He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 1992 until September 1992 \nand reported an honorable discharge. He served in the U.S. Army on active duty from \nMarch 1996 until September 1997 with an honorable discharge. He was in the Army \nReserve from March 2004 until June 2006, and reported on his SCA that he received a \ndischarge other than honorable. (Item 3) \nApplicant attended a technical institute from September 2010 to March 2013, with \na break, and from June 2013 to March 2015. He was taking evening class while he \nworked. The institute closed while he was in school and he did not receive a diploma. He \nhas worked for his current employer since February 2019 as a technician. (Item 3). \nApplicant completed his security clearance application on May 24, 2021. (Item 3) \nFINANCIAL \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has thirteen delinquent accounts in the amount of \napproximately $41,500. The majority of the debts are collection accounts for student \nloans, two medical accounts, and charged-off consumer accounts. (Item 1) \nIn his subject interview, Applicant reported that he is working with a financial coach \nto organize his debts from high priority to least priority. However, he is not establishing a \nrepayment plan nor working with creditors to lessen the debt. (Item 4) He also reported \nto the investigator that he failed to file and pay 2018 Federal and state taxes. He did not \nask for an extension and is trying to collect tax information from 2018. He has not made \nany efforts to resolve the issue. (Item 4) This is not alleged on the SOR, however in light \nof the whole person it is considered. (Item 4) \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, a collection account in the amount of $11,076, \nApplicant stated that he was not aware of this account and he is disputing it. He stated \nthat he never resided at this complex. He reported that it is now off his credit report. \nAs to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, through 1.f, and 1.h-1.i are collection accounts  for \nDepartment of Education student loans, Applicant submitted a letter, dated September \n13, 2021 stating he was relieved of his obligation to pay and that the credit bureaus \nremove all information reported by the Department regarding this debt from your credit  \nbureau report. This is the result of a scandal and closure of the institute that Applicant \nattended. I find for Applicant on these accounts. \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b61.g, a collection account in the amount of $2,929, Applicant \nstated he was not aware of this account and is disputing it.

(Item 5). \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.j a charged-off account in the amount of $450, Applicant \nadmitted the debt and stated that he is disputing the account. The current balance has \nnot changed. (Item 6) This appears to be a car loan and is on his credit report. (Item 5). \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.k a charged-off account in the amount of $432, Applicant \nstated that this was his ex-wife\u2019s account that she opened in his name. He stated that he \nfought to have it removed from his credit report and it no longer appears on the report. \n(Item 3) He submitted a copy of dispute packet from a partial credit report that reflected \nthe account was not paid. However, the credit report states that it was charged off. (Item \n5) \nAs to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b61.l and 1.m, medical accounts for $152 and $126, \nApplicant stated these were for hospital visits and should have been paid by the VA. He \nis not sure why they appear on his credit report. However, they have been removed from \nhis 2021 credit report. \nApplicant stated that he is now working with someone to \u201cget his credit in a better \nspace than what it has been over the years. He also has been disputing several \naccounts.\u201d (Item 5) For the other debts listed in the interview and his SCA, he would like \nto set up payment plans. \nThere is no information in the record that he received financial counseling or has \na budget. He did not produce sufficient evident to mitigate his case, Although, not listed \non the SOR, Applicant told the investigator that he had not filed his 2018 Federal and \nState taxes and has not done anything to resolve the issue. (Item 5) \n. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security\neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or\nconjecture. \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant did not attribute his financial problems to a singular incident or a period \nof time that caused financial hardship. He gave no insight into the reasons for his \naccumulation of debt. He either disputed the debts or stated that they had been removed \nfrom his credit report. He mitigated the student loan debts with the documentation from \nthe Department of Education who discharged the student loans of students who were \nvictimized by predatory lending practices of the technical institute under AG 20(b). He did \nnot participate in credit counseling and there are no clear indications that the remaining \ndebts are under control. None of the debts are being paid through payment plans. There \nis insufficient evidence to establish other above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and Applicant\u2019s military service and devotion to \nhis country, I conclude that Applicant has not presented sufficient mitigation. He disputed \nmany debts and relied on the fact that some have fallen off his credit report. However, his \nstudent loans are mitigated. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j  -  1.m \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b- 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate sexual behavior and criminal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 22, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the sexual behavior and criminal conduct \nguidelines the DoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility \nfor granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge \nto determine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked.

A \nhearing was scheduled for December 1, 2022, and heard on the date as scheduled. At \nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of eight exhibits (GEs 1-8). Applicant \nrelied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nDecember 12, 2022. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline D, Applicant allegedly (a) had nonconsensual sex in February \n2011 with a woman he met on a dating web-site and who reported him to enforcement \nauthorities in 2014; (b) met various women on a dating website between September \n2018 and December 2020, to whom he provided money or other items of value in \nexchange for sexual relations; (c) had nonconsensual sex with a woman he met on a \ndating web-site in December 2019, who reported to law enforcement that he had non-\nconsensual sex with her and verbally threatened her while showing her his gun \nmagazines, for which he was arrested and charged with kidnapping and sexual assault; \nand (d) a woman he previously met online reported to law enforcement in November \n2020 that he had nonconsensual sex with her while she was incapacitated in or around \nNovember 2017. These allegations were cross-alleged under Guideline J. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations covered by Guideline D, he \ndenied three of the four allegations with explanations and clarifications. He claimed the \n2014 incident was thoroughly investigated while he was in the military and was \nfavorable resolved. He also claimed the women he met on the dating web-site enjoyed \nhis discretionary generosity without consummating any transactional relationships. \nAdmitting the allegations averred in SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant claimed the kidnapping \nand sexual assault charges were dismissed and favorably resolved after the alleged \nvictim was uncooperative and reportedly filed a false police report. Responding to the \nallegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant denied the allegations and specifically \ndenied engaging in any nonconsensual sex. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE 1) He reenlisted \nin the Army in January 2002 and served another 13 years of active duty before he \nretired as a chief warrant officer with an honorable discharge in December 2015. (GE 1; \nTr. 19) Since December 2015, Applicant has been employed by his current contractor \nas a safety engineer. (GE 1; Tr. 18) He has held a security clearance since February \n2014. (GE 1)  \nApplicant\u2019s reported sexual encounters with women he met on dating sites \nFollowing his divorce from his first wife in 2010, Applicant dated for a couple of \nyears before deciding that dating did not work for him. (Tr. 20) Turning to dating sites to \nfind women with reconcilable backgrounds and companionable interests, he made it \nclear initially that he was not looking to pay for sex. (Tr. 20) For him, the dating site he \nlater chose in 2016 was good for him. (Tr. 20) He made his last contact with this dating \nsite \u201csometime in 2021.\u201d (Tr. 21) To be fair, Applicant began accessing dating sites as \nfar back as 2005, well before his 2010 divorce. (Tr. 28) \nBetween 2005 and 2017, Applicant accessed dating websites where he met \nnumerous women, some of whom he engaged in sexual relations with and provided \nmoney or other items of value. (GEs 2-8; Tr. 23-25, 27-28) His various encounters with \nthe women he met on dating websites are covered in his personal subject interview \n(PSI) of December 2018 and various investigation reports spanning 2014 through 2020. \n(GEs 2-8) Asked how many women he met over the four-year period he used the most \nrecent website, Applicant estimated 10 to 14; some (\u201csix or seven\u201d) he saw on more \nthan one occasion. (Tr. 21-24) To use his most recent dating site cost him $90 to $100 \na month. (Tr. 21-22) \nWhen meeting women for the first time on his chosen dating website, typically he \nwould ask them some initial questions about their interests before asking them out for \nface-to-face meetings. In these personal meetings (mostly in restaurants), he would ask \nthem about their interests and needs. (Tr. 22) If they indicated any interest in straight-up \nprostitution he terminated the meetings. (Tr. 22) Money requested by women he met \nand established sexual relationships with (six to seven he estimated) varied in amounts \nand was honored by Applicant: sometimes before he had sexual relations with them and \nsometimes afterwards. (Tr. 26) \nIn February 2011, Applicant met a woman (a Russian citizen at the time) on a \ndating website. (GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 16, 29-31) After stopping at his house to bag \ngroceries before proceeding to dinner, he escorted her upstairs where he engaged in \nsexual relations with her. (GEs 2-3) Throughout his brief relationship with this woman, \nshe asked him repeatedly for help with her green card that was about to expire. (GE 2) \nApplicant consistently insisted that his sexual encounter with the woman was \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsensual. (Tr. 30) After having one more conversation with this woman (six months \nlater), he never saw or heard from her again. (Tr. 30-31) \nThree years later (in 2014) the woman he met on a website with a visa issue filed \na claim with the federal agency who employed her, claiming Applicant engaged in \nnonconsensual sex with her in his home after making contact with her on a dating \nwebsite. (GEs 2-3) After conducting a thorough investigation of the reported incident, \nthe agency dismissed charges for cited insufficient evidence. (GE 3; Tr. 30-31) \nApplicant continues to insist his sexual encounter with this woman was consensual, and \nthere is no evidence in the record to corroborate either account. \nRecords document numerous encounters between Applicant and women he met \nthrough dating websites between September 2018 and December 2020. (GEs 2-8) In \nhis exchanges with the women he met on these websites, he sometimes provided them \nmoney or other items of value in exchange for sexual relations. Applicant assured that \nhe never made money or other items of value a condition of his having sexual relations \nwith the women he met on the websites. (GE 2; Tr. 26) \nIn December 2019, a woman that Applicant met on an online dating site later \nfiled a report with law enforcement authorities claiming he engaged in nonconsensual \nsex with her and verbally threatened her while showing her his gun magazines. (GE 5) \nApplicant insisted that his sexual encounter with this woman was consensual. (GE 2; Tr \n32). After engaging in brief sexual relations with the woman, Applicant asked her to \nspend the night with him, to which she declined. (GE 7) Before the woman departed, \nshe asked Applicant for the $500 he promised her when they met. When he declined, \nthe woman called the police and accused him of rape. (GEs 5-7; Tr. 33-34) \nWhen police later arrived at Applicant\u2019s apartment to investigate the woman\u2019s \ncomplaint, they asked him if he knew a certain woman, and whether that woman had \nbeen to his apartment. When he acknowledged one (identifying her by her first name) \nhad been there, police handcuffed him and escorted him to jail. (GEs 5 and 7) Once in \njail, police informed him that the woman who visited him in his apartment alleged he \nsexually assaulted and imprisoned her. Based on her complaints, the police formally \narrested him and charged him with kidnapping and assault. (GEs 5 and 7; Tr. 35-36) \nAfter spending six days in jail on the kidnapping and assault charges against him, \nApplicant posted bond and was released pending trial with a court date set in \nDecember 2020.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n Sexual Behavior \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \nThe Concern.

Applicant\u2019s use of these websites to formulate \nrelationships with these unknown women that would knowingly include sexual \nencounters raises questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nEven without evidence of convictions, sexual behavior that potentially involves a \ncriminal offense can subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, exploitation, \nor duress. \nSexual behavior concerns \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of engaging in sexual encounters with women he met on \ndating websites, and the inability in some of the cases to credibly surmount allegations \nof sexual assault and other abuses, raise major security concerns about his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. On the strength of the evidence presented, four \ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for sexual behavior apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), \u201dsexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted\u201d; 13(b) \u201cpattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high \nrisk sexual behavior that the individual is unable to stop\u201d; 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that \ncauses an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d; and 13(d), \n\u201csexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to being careful in screening the women \nhe has continued to access on the dating website he has used for over five years. He \nexpressed no regrets or judgment mistakes when confronted by the complaining women \nwho filed charges against him for sexual abuse and holding them against their will. In \nthe most recent case filed against him in 2020, the initiated government investigation \nremains pending despite Applicant\u2019s expressed lack of recollection of the underlying \n2017 incident. \nFactors to weigh and consider in determining whether an Applicant\u2019s sexual \nengagement with women he has met on dating websites are whether the engagements \nare isolated and dated, and whether they involve random women that reflect high-risk \nsexual behavior on the applicant\u2019s part that call into question an applicant\u2019s judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 16-03690 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2018) Even dated conduct, as is \nthe case with several of Applicant\u2019s complaining declarants, can be the source of an \napplicant\u2019s current vulnerability to coercion or influence.

July 19, 2019) \nEven though Applicant\u2019s dating site meetings and ensuing sexual encounters \nwith women he met on dating websites were essentially private in nature, his \nencounters can rise to the level of vulnerability exposure to risks of coercion and duress \nto complaining participants (as here) who feel emboldened enough to report him to \ngovernment agencies. This has happened with at least two of the women he met on \ndating sites and subsequently interacted with sexually. See ISCR Case No. 02-32254 at \n2 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004) Even the dismissal of criminal charges (as is the case here \nwith the set of charges tied to Applicant\u2019s 2011 sexual affair) does not preclude an \nunfavorable finding. See ISCR Case No. 17-00810 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Applicable DCs are (a), \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201ca \npattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a \nnational security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d and 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but \nnot limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of \ncriminal conduct regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d Trust in a person\u2019s ability to exercise good judgment, follow rules and \nregulations, and demonstrate reliability and trustworthiness are core criteria for \ndetermining whether a person is able to meet the minimum requirements for holding a \nsecurity clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n       \n      \n \n \n \n   \n                               \n \n \nIn the face of cited multiple judgment lapses associated with Applicant\u2019s access \nto dating websites over an extended period of years, more time is needed to restore \ntrust in Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid recurrent acts of high-risk sexual behavior in the \nforeseeable future. His noted military service, while worthy of considerable respect and \nappreciation, is not enough to counter his history of judgment lapses associated with his \ndetermined pattern of misuse of dating websites to meet and in some cases exceed the \nsexual expectations of the women he reportedly abused. \nWhile this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of \nthe national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any sexual \nbehavior and criminal conduct concerns the Government may have for the clearance \nholder employed by a defense contractor, the Government has the right to expect good \njudgment and trustworthy behavior for sustained periods of time from the trust \nrelationship it has with the clearance holder. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, \n511n.6 (1980) The lack of any charges and convictions in some of the cases involving \nApplicant, while noted and encouraging for Applicant, are not enough to facilitate safe \npredictions that he can avoid sexual transgressions with women he meets on dating \nsites in the foreseeable future. \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall maturity, good judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or\nsensitive position. While he presents with a lengthy and honorable military record, he\nlacks a sufficient track record of sustained avoidance of judgment lapses associated\nwith his pattern of misuse of dating sites in a number of instances to facilitate safe\npredictions he is at no risk of recurrence. Considering the record as a whole at this time,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s recognized contributions to the nation\u2019s defense efforts and all of\nthe facts and circumstances presented in this case, he does not mitigate security\nconcerns with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.d of Guideline H and\n2.a of Guideline J.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

He has worked \nfull time for his government contractor employer since about 2020. He also has another \nfull-time job that he began in March 2023. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2004.

He served in the Army National Guard from January 2014 until \nJanuary 2020, and the Army Reserve from 2020 until February 2022, earning an \nhonorable discharge from both. The DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nawarded him eligibility for a secret clearance in July 2020. (Tr. 37-40; GE 1-2; AE C) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant had not timely filed his \nfederal income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019, despite \nbeing required to do so (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The Government also alleged that he owed \napproximately $5,421 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2010, and that this federal tax \ndebt remained unpaid until about 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Finally, the Government alleged \nthat he owed approximately $2,339 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2011, and that \nthis federal tax debt remained unpaid until about 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, but he claimed that he has since filed all the \nrelevant federal income tax returns and paid the relevant delinquent federal taxes. With \nhis Answer, he also provided a document from the IRS showing he had a zero balance \nfor TY 2018, 2019, and 2020. (SOR; Answer) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TY 2012, 2015, \n2016, 2018, and 2019, despite being required to do so. He claimed that he filed his \nfederal income tax return for TY 2012 with the IRS in December 2020. He did not \nprovide an IRS account transcript to corroborate this filing. He did provide documents \nshowing that he received a refund from the IRS for TY 2021. He would not have \nreceived a refund if he had not filed his income tax return for TY 2012, so I find that he \nhas late filed his income tax return for TY 2012. He filed his federal income tax returns \nfor TY 2015 and 2016 in June 2018. He filed his federal income tax return for TY 2018 \nin August 2021. He filed his federal income tax return for TY 2019 in November 2020. \nWhile his IRS account transcript shows he filed the TY 2019 return in April 2022, a \nNovember 13, 2020 IRS letter reflects that he filed his TY 2019 return by November \n2020. (Tr.17-21, 23-32, 40-43, 46-47; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D) \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for TY 2020 in October 2021. He \nclaimed that he obtained a filing extension until October 2021 from the IRS for TY 2020, \nbut he provided no documentary evidence of this extension. He provided a document \nfrom the IRS reflecting a universal extension to file returns for TY 2019 from April 2020 \nto July 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any adverse information not alleged \nin the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax return for TY \n2020, will not be considered for disqualification purposes; however, it may be \nconsidered in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; in considering whether the \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person \nconcept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He timely filed his \nfederal income tax return for TY 2021 in March 2022. He timely filed his federal income \ntax return for TY 2022 in March 2023. (Tr. 62-65; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D) \nApplicant owed approximately $5,421 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2010 \nuntil about March 2022, when he satisfied this debt through IRS refund intercepts from \nother tax years. He owed approximately $2,339 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2011 \nuntil about October 2021, when he satisfied this debt through IRS refund intercepts from \nother tax years. He did not contact the IRS about voluntarily paying his 2010 and 2011 \nfederal tax delinquencies because he thought the refund intercepts were a sufficient \nmeans of addressing these debts. (Tr. 17, 30-32, 63-64, 73-75; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D) \nApplicant claimed that he owed taxes for TY 2010 and 2011 because he received \nbad advice from his tax preparer (TP A). He hired TP A to assist him to prepare and file \nhis federal income tax returns for TY 2010, 2011, and 2012 based upon a referral from \na friend of his that he trusted. With respect to his federal income tax return for TY 2012, \nhe assumed TP A was filing his return because he had provided TP A the necessary \npaperwork, but he learned sometime in 2013 that TP A was no longer in business. \nDespite knowing TP A was out of business sometime in 2013, he claimed he did not \nrealize he had not filed his 2012 federal income tax return until 2020, when he \ncompleted the interrogatories identified as GE 2. He claimed that TP A told him that he \ncould claim an exemption for a training course that the IRS later determined he could \nnot claim. This improperly claimed exemption is what caused him to owe taxes for TY \n2010 and 2011. He claimed that he did not learn that he owed the IRS money for \ndelinquent federal taxes for TY 2010 and 2011 until June or July 2012, when he \nreceived a notice from the IRS. He claimed that when he asked TP A how to pay the \ntaxes he owed the IRS for TY 2010 and 2011, TP A told him to wait until the IRS offset \nthose delinquencies with future federal tax refunds. (Tr. 17-21, 23-32, 41-43, 51-52, 76-\n77; Answer; GE 1-3; AE C)  \nApplicant also claimed that TP A told him that he could file his federal income tax \nreturns every other year. He claimed that he filed his income tax returns late based \nupon this advice. He claimed that he later learned that he had to file his federal income \ntax return annually, and pay any federal taxes owed when he filed the return. He \nacknowledged that he filed his federal income tax returns annually prior to TY 2012. He \nclaimed that he never had any federal tax issues prior to receiving this advice from TP \nA. (Tr. 17-21, 23-32, 41-43, 51-52, 76-77; Answer; GE 1-3; AE C) \nFor TY 2013 and 2014, Applicant used a \u201cchain\u201d tax preparation company (TP B) \nto assist him with filing those federal income tax returns. He filed his federal income tax \nreturns on time for those tax years, but his refunds were intercepted to partially satisfy \nhis 2010 and 2011 federal tax delinquencies. He did not seek advice from TP B as to \nhow to satisfy his 2010 and 2011 tax delinquencies other than through refund \nintercepts, but he acknowledged that he should have. He did not question TP B about \nwhether it is acceptable to file federal income tax returns every other year.

He claimed that he filed his federal income tax returns late for TY \n2015 and 2016 because he was waiting to file to see if he could pay off his delinquent \ntaxes prior to filing those returns. There is no evidence showing why paying off his \nfederal tax delinquencies could cause him to fail to file subsequent income tax returns, \nand he acknowledged he used bad judgment in following this course of action. TP B \noffered to file his federal income tax returns for TY 2015 and 2016, but he did not use \nTP B because their price increased. He did not consider filing his income tax returns on \nhis own, and he did not use military resources that were available to him. He claimed \nthat his mother passed away in 2015, and dealing with his grief also contributed to \nfailure to comply with income tax return requirements. (Tr. 17-21, 23-32, 52-61, 65-68, \n77; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D) \nApplicant timely filed his TY 2017 federal income tax return, using another tax \npreparation company (TP C). He also used TP C to late file his TY 2015 and 2016 \nfederal income tax returns in 2018. He filed his TY 2018 return late because he claimed \nhe had a work obligation that interfered with his doing so. TP C also went out of \nbusiness, so it was not available to assist him with filing. He claimed without providing \ncorroborating documentation that he received an IRS extension for TY 2018, but he did \nnot meet the extended deadline. He ultimately late filed his income tax return for TY \n2018 because he realized he might not be able to obtain a security clearance with \noutstanding tax obligations. He claimed that he now knows the importance of complying \nwith tax responsibilities, partly because it is part of his civic duty, and he will continue to \ndo so in the future. I observed Applicant while he testified and found him to be honest \nand credible. (Tr. 17-21, 23-32, 52-61, 65-68, 77; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D) \nApplicant claimed that he keeps close track of his credit, especially as his \npersonal information has been involved in data leaks. He has worked with a police \ndetective in State A when he found out that his information was being used on the dark \nweb and has availed himself of credit monitoring services offered by the companies \nwhose computer information systems were breached. He claimed that these data \nbreaches interfered with his ability to timely file his federal income tax returns, but he \nprovided no reasonable nexus between the two. Notwithstanding the debt contained in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d that the Government withdrew, Applicant has one other account, a credit \ncard, that is not more than two payments past due. This credit-card debt is not alleged \nin the SOR.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nDespite being required to do so, Applicant did not timely file federal income tax \nreturns for several years. He was also delinquent on paying his federal income taxes for \nTY 2010 and 2011 for about a decade. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018).

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has now filed all his federal income tax returns that were listed in the \nSOR. He has also timely filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2021 and TY 2022. \nHe has satisfied his delinquent federal income taxes through involuntary IRS refund \nintercepts. He does not have a federal tax balance for TY 2021 and TY 2022. He \ntestified that he understands his tax responsibilities and will comply with them. His \nactions in complying with his SOR tax obligations and his tax obligations for TY 2021 \nand TY 2022 bolster these statements, show reform and rehabilitation, and show a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. I find that his financial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) applies. \nApplicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes and file his federal income \ntax returns for several reasons. Some, such as initially relying on bad advice from TP A \nwere beyond his control. Others, such as continuing to believe it was acceptable to file \nhis income tax returns every other year and pay delinquent taxes through refund \nintercepts after using TP B were within his control. He should have inquired with TP B \nwhether these tax practices were acceptable, but he did not. This is especially true \nwhen considering that he realized in 2013 that TP A provided him with bad tax advice \nbecause he tried to claim an expense that he should not have. A degree of ignorance to \none\u2019s financial situation may suggest an indifference to the proper satisfaction of legal \nobligations that draws into question Applicant\u2019s willingness or capacity to comply with \nthe sometimes complex rules governing the handling and safeguarding of classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 18-02914 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2020). \nWith respect to those circumstances that were beyond his control, for AG \u00b6 20(b) \nto apply, he must also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to these tax obligations. He began addressing his delinquent income tax return \nfilings when he realized his clearance was in jeopardy. An applicant who begins to \nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). He also paid his delinquent federal taxes \nfor TY 2010 and 2011 through involuntary, IRS refund intercepts. Court-ordered or \notherwise involuntary means of debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to \nless weight than actions initiated and carried through by the debtor. ISCR Case No. 17-\n04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). With respect to those conditions that were beyond \nhis control, he has not shown that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has repaid all his delinquent federal taxes. However, as referenced \nabove, he paid them through involuntary, IRS refund intercepts which are of less \nmitigating effect and fail to show good faith. Moreover, he did not initiate these \npayments because they were involuntary. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has filed his delinquent federal income tax returns, and he has paid his \ndelinquent federal taxes. However, there is insufficient evidence to show that he made \nan arrangement with the IRS to do so. Instead, the evidence shows that he involuntarily \nallowed the IRS to intercept his subsequent years\u2019 refunds to pay off his delinquent \nfederal taxes. AG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies. \nOne of the mitigating conditions fully applies and another partially applies. \nApplication of a particular mitigating condition does not necessarily establish overall \nmitigation. However, the purpose of a security clearance case is not to assign guilt or \nblame and then punish or sanction a person for their past actions. Likewise, a security \nclearance case is not aimed at collecting debts. Rather the purpose is to make an \nexamination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make a determination that the \npersonal is an acceptable security risk. While he clearly was remiss in satisfying his \nfederal tax obligations in years past, as evidenced by his recent compliance, I believe \nhe has learned his lesson, and he will continue to comply with these obligations. His \npast tax compliance failures no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that he has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, and I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nApplicant showed contrition and a current understanding of his tax filing and \npayment responsibilities. He has remedied his tax deficiencies, and he has shown \nreform and rehabilitation by timely filing his last two annual income tax returns without a \ntax delinquency for either. The record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Her \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old. She was married in 2013 and has one minor child. She \ntook college classes from 2007-2010. She resumed her studies in 2018, and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2021. Recently, she has been taking classes to earn a master\u2019s \ndegree. She served in the Navy from 2010-2018 and received an honorable discharge. \nShe has worked as a program analyst for a defense contractor since 2018. (TR. 22-26; \nGE 1) \nWhen Applicant left the Navy in May 2018, she was unemployed until October \n2018. She reported that in 2018, her husband was also out of work for six months. \nApplicant claimed that she worked steadily from October 2018 until August 2019, when \nher son, who was about two years old at the time, began having serious health problems \nand required hospital care. She reported that she took a leave of absence from work until \nhis health stabilized, and she returned to work full-time in January 2020. She stated that \nher employment continued until May 2020, when the contract she worked on ended. She \nreported that she worked part-time for about three months, before she found a new full-\ntime project with her employer. (Tr. 27-35, 74-78; GE 1, 2; AE E) \nApplicant stated that the unemployment events from 2018-2020 created financial \nhardship and caused some of her debts to become delinquent. Her son\u2019s medical \ntreatments also created new debt for the family. Applicant asserted that once her and her \nhusband\u2019s employment situation stabilized, she started to resolve her delinquent debt. \n(Tr. 27-35, 74-78; GE 1, 2; AE E) \nThe SOR alleges about $35,000 of delinquent debt. The status of the allegations \nis as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h are student loans in collection totaling $17,724. \nThe original loan debt was for about $44,000. Applicant claimed that she stopped taking \ncollege classes in 2010, shortly before she entered the Navy. Her student loan records \nshow that she had made loan payments while in the military, but the payments stopped \nin 2018, and she entered default status. She claimed that because of the financial \nhardship that she faced during that time, she was unable to make payments. In March \n2019, she reported that her paycheck was garnished to pay her student loans. She stated \nthat in 2021, she was able to make some voluntary payments on her student loans to \nbring them out of collection. The record shows that these loans were consolidated in \nMarch 2022, are no longer in collection. The consolidated loans were entered into the \ngovernment program for Covid-19 deferment status in June 2022. She estimated that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nonce the deferment period ends, her payments will be about $150 monthly. (Tr. 27-35, \n45-53, 74-78; AE D, E, I; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d are personal loans in collection for $4,841 and $4,219, \nrespectively. Applicant claimed that these are the same debt. The credit report shows that \nthe debts are from the same creditor, and \u00b6 1.d appears to be a duplicate entry from a \ncollection agency for a slightly lesser amount. She stated that she took out a personal \nloan in 2015 to help pay for the funeral expenses of a family member. She reported that \nshe was making payments on the loan until 2018, when she was unable to afford the \npayments. She claimed that this debt is paid, and her 2022 credit report shows that all \naccounts with this creditor have no balance. This debt is resolved. (TR. 32, 53-59; GE 3, \n5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a credit card that was charged off for $2,917. Applicant reported that \nshe stopped making payments in 2018 due to financial hardship. She asserted that in \n2021, she started making $50 monthly payments on the account, and the record shows \nthat the balance is down to $475.

Applicant reported that these medical debts originated during her son\u2019s hospital\ncare in 2019. The 2021 credit report shows that these debts have been paid.  (Tr.32-33,\n59-64; GE 3, 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o, 1.r, and 1.s are medical debts placed for collection for $390, $164, \nand $134, respectively. Applicant reported that these medical debts originated during her \nson\u2019s hospital care in 2019. She testified that she has made $50 monthly payments \ntowards \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.r and has paid 1.s. In post-hearing documentation from the creditor, \nthe account documentation shows that she has made 27 payments for medical debts to \nthis creditor from January 2021 to December 2021. There is no indication in the \ndocumentation that she continues to owe a balance on these medical debts. These debts \nare resolved. (Tr. 32-33, 59-64; AE H; GE 3, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a loan that was placed for collection for $750. Applicant claimed that \nthis was a loan to cover rent and that it has been paid. However, she did not provide \nsufficient documentation to substantiate this claim. (Tr. 33-34, 65-66; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a credit card that was placed for collection for $734. Applicant claimed \nthat she paid the debt, and the record shows that it was settled in October 2020. This \ndebt is now resolved. (Tr. 66-67; AE C; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.m is a debt in collection for $713. Applicant stated this was a fee from a \nhome rental lease. She claimed that she paid it in 2021, but did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation to substantiate this claim. (Tr. 33, 67; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a credit card that was charged off for $401. Applicant stated that this \nwas her husband\u2019s credit card and that she was only an authorized user.

(Tr. \n33, 68; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.q is a debt to a cellular phone service provider. Applicant claims that this \ndebt was for a phone that she co-signed for her sister, who needed assistance. She \nreported that her sister failed to meet her payment obligations, and she had to pay the \ndebt. The record shows that this debt was paid in 2020. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 33-34, \n68-70; AE B; GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s budget shows that her and her husband\u2019s finances are stable, and they \ncan afford their monthly expenses. Their current monthly income exceeds their expenses \nby about $1,000. (Tr. 37-45; AE J) \nApplicant submitted two character references which state that she is a talented \nemployee, a respected member of her community, and she is reliable and trustworthy. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.k, 1.o, and 1.r-\n1.w) and three collections (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.l and 1.q) have been paid. SOR \u00b6 1.d is a \nduplicate. These allegations are resolved for Applicant.  \nApplicant\u2019s student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h) are current, and she \nhas submitted evidence that she is paying off the balance on the credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.f.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial hardships occurred between 2018-2020, and she has taken \nsignificant steps to resolve debts that became delinquent during this time period. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) partially applies. However, since she did not submit sufficient documentation to \nshow that some her debts are paid or being resolved (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.m 1.n, and 1.p \ntotaling $2097) these debts are considered ongoing, so AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial hardships were caused by temporary \nunemployment that she and her husband experienced between 2018-2020, and her son\u2019s \nmedical treatment in 2019. These were circumstances beyond her control, and she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances by resolving most of her debts. \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that she has undertaken good-faith efforts \nto address her debts. Applicant is not required to show that she has paid or resolved all \nof her debts, or that she has done so in any particular way. She has shown that she has \na reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has implemented it. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered her military service and her character letters. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.w: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has worked as a security guard since 2009. He has \nheld security clearances for over a decade. (Tr. at 15-16 and GE-2 at 13.) He divorced in \n2006 after seven years of marriage and has two adult children. He married his current \nspouse in 2018. His spouse is employed. \nApplicant worked full time as a corrections officer from 1998 until 2013. He was \nterminated from the position for fraternization with an inmate by providing the inmate \nadditional food. He has maintained a side business in the entertainment and events \nindustry since 2000. In 2012, he was required to obtain a business license, and he lists \n2012 on his security clearance application as the year he started this business. After his \ntermination, his security guard company took him on full time. He relied primarily on his \nsecurity guard income during this five-year period. (Tr. at 49.) In 2018 and 2019 he worked \nas an armed security officer. He has worked with a correctional facility since July 2019. \nHis income from working the two jobs was less than $100,000 annually. (Tr. at 40.) \nApplicant testified his side business required him to use credit cards to obtain \nequipment. He has spent about $20,000 over the years for equipment, and now must pay \n\u201ca lot of taxes, personal property taxes every year, based on all of that equipment\u201d that \nhe owns. (Tr. at 101-102, 105.) Prior to COVID, he typically did 25 to 30 events and would \ncharge anywhere from $200 to $300 per event. Since COVID he has done approximately \n10 to 15 events. He testified he spent more on the business than what he made. (Tr. at \n107.) \nApplicant moved in with his father after his 2006 divorce.

He provided $7,858 in cash to close. \nHis monthly mortgage payment was estimated to be $1,326. (Tr. at 91-92 and AE-L.) His \nnew home also required repairs. (Tr. at 92 and AE-M.) He is the only person listed on the \nmortgage paperwork. He testified that he and his wife split the mortgage on the new \nhome. (Tr. at 43.) \nIn his 2020 security clearance interview, Applicant stated multiple times that his \nfinancial issues started in 2013 and 2014 after his father passed away, when his father \nactually passed away in 2017.

He initialed the page that explained \nthe \u201cdebt resolution strategy\u201d consisted of stopping payment to his creditors to allow the \nlaw firm to negotiate and settle his debts from these saved funds. (AE-R at 10.) This action \nwas not discussed in his 2020 security clearance interview or raised during the hearing. \nHe engaged another law firm in May 2020 to help him resolve his debts and repair his \ncredit.

(Tr. at 66.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due account referred for collection for $9,651. Applicant \nadmitted he took a loan for about $11,000 at a 25.26 percent interest rate. (Tr. at 54.) He \ncould not state when he made his last payment. (Tr. at 56.) He ultimately settled the \naccount in August 2021 for $4,727, in ten payments from September 2021 through June \n2022. (Tr. at 27, 56 and AE-H.) He cited other obligations, such as child support, for why \nhe stopped making payments on the loan. (Tr. at 57-58.)

Applicant used \nthis credit card, when his father was living, for repairs to his father\u2019s home in 2016. (Tr. at \n60.) The credit card became delinquent in 2018. (GE-4 and Tr. at 60.) The law firm \ncontacted the creditor and as a result the creditor placed a block on the account. He had \nto get the block released in order to settle the account. (Tr. 28-29 and 61.) In his post-\nhearing submission, he provided a letter to the creditor summarizing his $2,700 \nsettlement agreement, that he had reached with the company\u2019s agent. The letter stated: \n\u201cOn April 11, 2023[,] I have agreed to make payments in the amount of $112.50 every \n28th of the month starting on April 28, 2023[,] for 24 months.

(AE-N.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are fully applicable. The expenses associated with the \npassing of Applicant's father and personal business expenses incurred during a period of \nunder employment for himself, were circumstances beyond his control. Prior to the \nsecurity application process Applicant sought out assistance to address financial situation \nthrough a law firm handling delinquent debt. During the security clearance application \nprocess, he obtained another law firm to assist him in negotiating a resolution and repair \nhis credit. He has resolved four of his SOR debts. He has demonstrated through his \nactions that he is determined to overcome his indebtedness. He knows that regaining \nfinancial responsibility is essential to qualify for a security clearance and has taken \nreasonable and measured steps to resolve his debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation \nto resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns about financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:     \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Answer 2; \nTr. at 6-9, 24-36, 71-72, 90-91; GE 1-2; AE A) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has seven delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$27,904 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.e-1.i), and three delinquent medical debts totaling $373 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.j). It also alleges that she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in \nJune 2002 and March 2012, and her bankruptcy cases were discharged in November \n2002 and June 2012, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.l). The SOR allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions in Answer 1 and Answer 2, her 2019 SF 86, and \nher February 2020 and April 2020 background interviews. A credit report from August \n2020 lists the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, as well as her 2012 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy case discharge. Bankruptcy records reflect both of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ncases. (Answer 1-2; GE 1-8) \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debt to raising three children as a single \nmother with significant periods of unemployment or underemployment. She raised her \nchildren in an area with a higher cost of living, instead of an inner city, so that they could \nlive in a safe environment and receive a quality education. She stated that she filed \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002, at age 27, because she lacked financial literacy, and her \nmother advised her to do so to avoid wage garnishment and to wipe her slate clean. \nShe feared the impact that wage garnishment would have on her ability to raise her \nchildren. Despite her 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case discharge, she accumulated \n2 \n\n \n \n \ndebts after she lost her job in 2009. She enrolled in college to obtain a degree so that \nshe could have job security, but her debts again accumulated. She stated she filed \nChapter 7 bankruptcy again, in 2012, for the same reasons that she filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2002. Her debts accumulated again beginning in 2015, when she became \na caretaker for her mother at various periods until October 2018, when her mother \npassed away; when she moved within state in January 2017; and when she became \nunemployed again in February 2017. She stated that she began to take control of her \nfinances in 2019, and she has learned that another bankruptcy would denote financial \nirresponsibility. (Answer 2; Tr. at 23-36, 62-70, 76-92; GE 1-2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $20,907 charged-off auto account, for a car Applicant \npurchased in 2016. She fell behind on her monthly car payments in 2018, when she \nwas unemployed. During this time, she also began having to pay for significant car \nrepairs, and then her car\u2019s engine failed. She could not afford to pay $5,000 to replace \nher car\u2019s engine, so she purchased another car, a used minivan, for $15,000. She could \nnot make the car payments for the car whose engine failed, so she voluntarily \nsurrendered it. She unsuccessfully attempted to reach a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor, both before and after she voluntarily surrendered it. In Answer 2, she was in \nthe process of finalizing a $2,090 settlement for this debt. Documentation reflects that \nshe made a $2,094 payment in January 2022, and she settled this debt in March 2022. \nHer October 2022 credit bureau report also reflects that this debt is settled. (Answer 2; \nTr. at 36-48, 83-87; GE 1, 3; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $5,048 charged-off rent-to-buy furniture account. Applicant\nopened this account in approximately 2016 to purchase furniture for a friend, with the \nunderstanding that her friend would be responsible for the payments. She bore \nresponsibility for the account after her friend backed out. She indicated during her \nbackground interview that she could not afford the high interest rate on this account. \nShe stated in Answer 2 that she discussed with the creditor in approximately 2022 a \nsettlement of $1,872 for this debt, which she intended to begin saving towards once she \ntackled some of her other delinquent debts. This debt was still reported on her October \n2022 credit bureau report. She intends to resolve this debt.

Applicant believed her medical insurance covered her medical expenses, \nand she was unaware that these amounts were outstanding. She stated in Answer 2 \nthat she contacted the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.c to resolve this debt. Documentation \nreflects that she made a payment of $50 toward this debt in February 2020. She \nintended to set up a monthly payment arrangement of $40 for six months to resolve the \nremaining balance. She stated in Answer 2 that she pulled a copy of her credit bureau \nreport from each of the three major credit bureaus, but she could not locate the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. She testified that she paid $62 to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.j. Documentation \nreflecting that she made a $62 payment in February 2020 corroborates her claim. \n(Answer 2; Tr. at 55-57, 61, 94; GE 2-3) \n3 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $547 credit card placed for collection.

At her request, the creditor closed this \naccount in October 2021, because she could no longer afford to pay it. She stated in her \nSF 86 that she reached out to the creditor to try to resolve this debt. She stated in \nAnswer 2 that she made a payment of $547 to resolve this debt. Her October 2022 \ncredit bureau report reflects that this debt is \u201cpaid\u201d with a zero balance. (Answer 2; Tr. at \n57-60; GE 1-3; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $250 department store credit card placed for collection. \nApplicant used the card to buy shoes for her children. She indicated during her \nbackground interview that the creditor charged her for two items from a catalog order \nthat she did not receive. She accepted responsibility for the charges after \nunsuccessfully disputing them with the creditor. She stated in Answer 2 that she settled \nthis debt for $120 and she was awaiting a letter from the creditor stating such. \nDocumentation reflects that she made a payment of $120 to the creditor in March 2020. \nHer October 2022 credit bureau report also reflects that this debt has a zero balance. \n(Answer 2; Tr. at 60-61; GE 2-3; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a $749 payday loan placed for collection. Applicant indicated \nduring her background interview that she obtained a loan to help her pay for rent, \nbecause she did not receive any financial assistance from her then-boyfriend, and then \nshe could not afford to repay the loan. She settled this debt for $560 in February 2020. \nDocumentation reflects that the creditor notified her in November 2021 that she paid this \nloan. (Answer 2; Tr. at 61, 92-93; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is for a $218 wireless cellular phone service account placed for \ncollection.

She stated in Answer 2 that the collection agency went out of business after \nsettlement, and the original creditor came after her for the remaining $65 balance. She \nintended to resolve this debt. (Answer 2; Tr. at 61, 93-94; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is for a $185 credit card placed for collection. Applicant indicated \nduring her background interview that she opened this credit card to build her credit, and \nshe used this card for lunch and gas. She stated in Answer 2 that she settled this debt \nfor $148.

She testified that she claimed approximately $10,000 in liabilities, primarily \nrelated to her car, in her 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She testified that she was required \nto take a credit counseling class as part of her 2002 bankruptcy. Records from her 2012 \nChapter 7 bankruptcy reflects that she claimed liabilities of approximately $34,854, and \nshe received credit counseling as part of that bankruptcy process in March 2012.

She stated that she does not plan to file \nbankruptcy or voluntarily surrender another car in the future; she plans to maintain \ncontrol of her finances; and she does not plan to open any other accounts in her name \nfor others. She does not have any other delinquent debts. (Answer 2; Tr. at 23-24, 70-\n76, 83-90, 95; GE 1-2; AE A) \nApplicant provided letters of support from two friends, one of whom has known \nher for nearly 14 years and the other for over 4 years. Both attested to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, integrity, and judgment. She also provided letters of support from three \nindividuals who recommended her, in August 2022, for a master\u2019s scholars program. \nTwo individuals, both directors at a military medical facility where Applicant works, \nattested to her superior work ethic. A third individual, Applicant\u2019s college instructor and \nacademic advisor, described Applicant\u2019s commitment to excellence. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n5 \n\n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Before she received the SOR, she settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, \n1.g, 1.i, and 1.j, and she made a payment toward SOR \u00b6 1.c. Although she filed for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy twice, she did so in 2002 and 2012. She does not intend to file \nbankruptcy in the future, she has gained control of her finances, and she has learned \nfinancial responsibility. She received financial counseling in 2002 and 2012, and she \ndeveloped a budget to track her income and expenses. She intends to continue to \nresolve her remaining delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.h. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n7 \n\n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

In 1993, they started their own private investigation agency; \nhowever, her husband worked almost exclusively as a self-employed commercial \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfisherman until he was seriously injured in 2019. Due to his injuries and subsequent \ncomplications therefrom, he has not worked since 2019, resulting in a loss of about $3,000 \nin monthly income. Their private investigation agency has been largely dormant, \nproducing little or no income, since about 2005. (AX A; Tr. 42 \u2013 44, 63 \u2013 67) \nBetween March 1997 and April 2015, Applicant earned about $90,000 annually \nfrom her work for a single private sector company in State B. Concurrently, she also \nworked on a part-time basis as an investigator for other companies. When her \nemployment in State B ended, she obtained full-time investigative work with at least three \ncompanies to make up for the loss of income. Some of that work required she travel \nbetween State A and State B, and to distant parts of State A, incurring travel and lodging \nexpenses that offset some of her income. Additionally, she used credit cards to help her \nhusband pay business-related expenses, including major boat repairs. She estimates that \nabout half of the debt reflected in the SOR is attributable to her husband\u2019s business. The \nother half reflects her use of personal credit to meet expenses when her income fell in \n2015 and when her husband became disabled in 2019. Credit reports produced by the \nGovernment show that most of the accounts in the SOR were past due, charged off, or \nbecame delinquent in 2019. Up to that point, Applicant and her husband remained in good \nstanding by making minimum monthly payments on their credit cards. There is no \nindication in this record that her husband\u2019s business was incorporated or that any of the \ncredit cards at issue were opened in the name of that business. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; \nGX 3; GX 4; AX A; Tr. 40 \u2013 44, 67 \u2013 70) \nIn 2005, Applicant and her husband bought a small farm on which they boarded \nand cared for rescued horses. The home they had purchased in 1989 remained their \nprimary residence until 2018, when they decided to rent out that property and move to the \nfarm. They then sold the first house in 2020, realizing about $20,000 profit that went to \nfarm repairs and some debt payments not specified in this record. (GX 1; GX 7; Tr. 52 \u2013 \n55) \nIn May 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of \nher most recent background review. She and the investigator discussed multiple debts \nthat were past due or delinquent according to a credit report obtained in April 2020. As to \neach of the then unresolved debts they discussed, Applicant told the investigator she had \n\u201cmade arrangements to resolve [the debt] by starting negotiations for [a] payment plan.\u201d \nIn her January 2022 responses to each of the SOR allegations, she stated \u201cAgreed \u2013 \nPayment Plan.\u201d At the hearing, Applicant testified that when she answered the SOR, she \nhad not established any payment plans for any of her debts. In 2019 and 2020, when she \ntried to negotiate payment plans with her creditors, they wanted more than she could \nafford to pay and would not accept partial payments. (Answer; GX 7; Tr. 43 \u2013 45, 72) \nAt the hearing, Applicant provided information showing she has resolved the debts \nalleged at SOR 1.a and 1.x. Both debts, owed to the same creditor, were settled in August \n2023 in response to civil lawsuits brought against her by that creditor. She also provided \ninformation showing that she has agreed with that creditor to monthly payment plans to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsettle the debts alleged at SOR 1.ee and 1.gg. Those agreements were made about a \nweek before her hearing, with first payments due about two weeks after the hearing. The \nrecord does not contain any further information showing how or if Applicant has acted to \npay or otherwise resolve any other SOR debts. (Answer; GX5; GX 6; AX B; Tr. 37 \u2013 38, \n46 \u2013 48) \nApplicant has not sought assistance from a professional financial counselor to \nresolve her financial problems. She and her husband currently earn about $8,100 each \nmonth from her investigative work, as well as from her law enforcement pension, and \nSocial Security benefits for both. She estimates their monthly expenses are about $5,100 \nand that, after other expenses, they have about $2,000 remaining each month. (Tr. 49 \u2013 \n50, 55 \u2013 59) \nApplicant has a good reputation among friends and associates for diligence, hard \nwork, reliability, and integrity. She dedicates much of her personal time and resources to \nthe care of old and infirm horses. She has not incurred any new unpaid debts, and she \nhas always filed and paid her taxes as required. (AX A; Tr. 67 \u2013 68) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent \ndebts. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \nthat is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy contrast, I have considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions that \npertain to these facts and circumstances: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are multiple and substantial. By virtue \nof the fact as many as 33 of the 35 debts alleged remain unresolved, her financial \nproblems are recent and ongoing. Further, her overreliance on personal credit and her \nfailure to take steps to resolve her debts reflect poorly on her judgment and reliability. \nAs to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant asserts her financial troubles began when her husband \nwas injured and became unable to work, a circumstance that continues to this day. She \nfurther claims that she was already struggling to make ends meet after being laid off from \na well-paying job in 2015, which resulted in working at least three investigative jobs at the \nsame time. When her husband was disabled, she was unable to continue making required \nminimum payments on more than 30 credit cards she had been carrying for several years. \nThe 2015 lay-off and her husband\u2019s injury were conditions largely beyond her control. \nNonetheless, the record also presents a severe overreliance on credit cards over time \nthat left her with little or no margin for error should such unforeseen events arise. I \nconclude it was reasonably foreseeable that Applicant put herself in a precarious financial \ncondition that was bound to fail, and which showed poor judgment in managing her \npersonal finances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply here. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant has not sought any professional \nfinancial counseling to assist in the resolution of her debts or the management of her \nfinances. Additionally, she has not addressed her debts in a prompt or reliable way. Her \nresolution of the debts at SOR 1.a and 1.x occurred recently and only because of legal \naction against her by the creditor. The two payment plans for SOR 1.ee and 1.gg were \nput in place only about a week before the hearing and were not scheduled for first \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \npayment until after the hearing. Applicant\u2019s overall inaction to resolve her debts since \n2019 undermines confidence that she is acting in good faith to resolve her financial \nproblems. On balance, I conclude that the security concerns raised by the adverse \ninformation about Applicant\u2019s finances are not mitigated. \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). Despite the positive information presented, the record evidence as a whole leaves \nunresolved the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a clearance that have been raised \nby the Government\u2019s information. Because protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications, those remaining doubts must be resolved against \nthe granting of access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.ii: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMatthew E. Malone \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 37 years old. He served in the National Guard from 2008 to 2014 and was honorably discharged. He attended community college from 2010 to 2011 and another college for one semester in 2017. He married in 2015. His wife is a citizen of Kyrgyzstan and is pending naturalization as a U.S. citizen. She does not yet have a permanent resident card. Applicant has a stepchild and two children. All three children were born in Kyrgyzstan. His two biological children are citizens of the United States. Applicant is employed overseas, and he and his family live with him there. (Item 3; AE A) Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor since July 2018. On his September 2018 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he was unemployed from May 2014 to November 2014 and November 2014 to February 2015. (Item 3) In his 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($462) and 1.b ($878) are to the same creditor. Applicant said he was in the process of repaying both of these debts. During his December 2018 interview with a government investigator, he said he intended to address 2 his financial issues aggressively with excess pay he was earning. He acknowledged the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e a",

Without objection, I have taken administrative notice \nof the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and \nwill not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the fact that Kyrgyzstan \nhas increasingly aligned its interests with Russia and China. These countries provide \nsupport and regularly conduct joint exercises with Kyrgyzstan and provide information on \npeople suspected of terrorism and provide military technical equipment. Russia maintains \na military base in the country. Russia has asserted that it has a rightful claim to all \nterritories from the former Russian Empire, which include Kyrgyzstan. An undetermined \nnumber of citizens of Kyrgyzstan have left the country to join ISIS and other terrorist \ngroups. Organized crime is a problem in the country. There are significant human rights \nissues in the country, including arbitrary killings by police, high-profile disappearances, \nuse of torture by law enforcement and security services, arbitrary arrests, and violence \nagainst journalists and minority groups. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR except for \u00b6 1.f, which he denied.

He served in the National Guard from 2008 to 2014 and \nwas honorably discharged. He attended community college from 2010 to 2011 and \nanother college for one semester in 2017. He married in 2015. His wife is a citizen of \nKyrgyzstan and is pending naturalization as a U.S. citizen. She does not yet have a \npermanent resident card. Applicant has a stepchild and two children. All three children \nwere born in Kyrgyzstan. His two biological children are citizens of the United States. \nApplicant is employed overseas, and he and his family live with him there. (Item 3; AE A) \nApplicant has been employed by a federal contractor since July 2018. On his \nSeptember 2018 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he was unemployed \nfrom May 2014 to November 2014 and November 2014 to February 2015. (Item 3) \nIn his 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, \n1.e, and 1.f. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($462) and 1.b ($878) are to the same creditor. \nApplicant said he was in the process of repaying both of these debts.

In Applicant\u2019s March 2022 answer to the SOR, \nhe admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e and denied the debt in 1.f. Regarding \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, he said once he contacts the creditor to get the \nnecessary information to access pay options, he will pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and make \na partial payment for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. In his response to the FORM, Applicant did \nnot provide any evidence that he has taken action to resolve these debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b are unresolved. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($6,719) and 1.e ($9,595) are to the same creditor. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d is a credit card debt. It appears that SOR \u00b6 1.e is a loan. In his SCA, Applicant \nstated for SOR \u00b6 1.d that he was unable to make the payments on the account. He said, \n\u201crepayment is ongoing to correct this debt.\u201d (Item 3) The delinquency began in 2017. He \nstated the action he was taking was as follows: \u201cI am working with [creditor] to resolve \nthis issue and hopefully have the card reinstated.\u201d (Item 3) For SOR \u00b6 1.e he said, \u201cI am \nplanning to make payments for this after repaying the credit card debt.\u201d (Item 3) He \nacknowledged the debts with the government investigator and said he was aggressively \naddressing them with his excess pay. In his SOR answer, he said he will work with the \ncreditor to resolve both debts as soon as possible after he completes paying the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. He said it may take time, but he will bring the accounts into good \nstanding. In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he said he had contacted the creditor and \nmade payment arrangements whereby monthly payments would be automatically \ndeducted from his account. No evidence was provided to show the payment \narrangements or other actions to resolve the debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are unresolved. \n(Items 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,720) and said he \nwill pay it off after he has paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. No evidence was provided \nto show he has been paying any of his delinquent debts. \nApplicant reported the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($13,047) in his SCA. This debt was for a \nrepossessed car in 2014 during a time when he was laid off from his job, and unable to \nmake payments on the car and then his son was born. He said the car was sold and the \ndebt resolved. During his December 2018 background interview, he acknowledged the \ndebt. In his answer to the SOR, he said the debt should not be on his credit report because \nthe creditor recouped the money owed. He said, \u201cI am opening a dispute to have it \nremoved.\u201d The debt is reported on his April 2021 credit report as \u201ccharged off\u201d and \n\u201caccount paid for less than full balance.\u201d He said he received a letter that the car was \nsold, and the debt recovered. He assumed he did not have to repay any amount. This \ndebt is resolved. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A) \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant said \u201cI am working to resolve my debt \nissues but right now I am trying to get my wife a green card so that we can have two \nincomes which will help with repayments as well.\u201d (AE A) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and a brother-in-law are all citizens \nand residents of Kyrgyzstan.

His mother-in-law is not employed. In his SCA, he reported his sisters-in-law were \nnot employed. He reported his brother-in-law has a logistics company. In his answer to \nthe SOR, he said his sisters-in-law own and operate a restaurant. In his response to the \nFORM, he acknowledged that Kyrgyzstan is a hostile place to him and his children \nbecause of their race. He said his wife\u2019s family is not affiliated with the government of \nKyrgyzstan. (Items 2, 3, 4; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debt totaling approximately $19,375. He began to incur \ndelinquent debt in 2014 when he was laid off and after the birth of his child. He has been \nsteadily employed since 2015. Since approximately 2018, he has repeatedly stated that \nhe either was paying or intended to pay his delinquent debt but has not provided evidence \nthat he has taken any action to resolve his debts. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant failed to provide any documentary proof that he has paid or made \npayment arrangements to resolve any of the alleged debts, despite promising to do so for \nyears. His debts are ongoing and recent. He lost his job in 2014 and his car was \nrepossessed, and his child was born. He has been steadily employed since 2015. \nApplicant has not provided evidence he has acted responsibly regarding the resolution of \nany of his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. There is no evidence that Applicant \nhas participated in financial counseling or that he has made good-faith efforts to resolve \nany of his debts. The debt is SOR \u00b6 1.f was resolved through the sale of the repossessed \nvehicle. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and\ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThere are terrorism concerns, ongoing human rights problems, and concerns \nabout Kyrgyzstan\u2019s ties to both Russia and China. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s \nties to Kyrgyzstan. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. Based on detailed \ninformation provided in HE I there is sufficient intelligence information that raises security \nconcerns about Kyrgyzstan. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens of \nKyrgyzstan. Applicant stated that he has applied for a green card for his wife, but it has \nnot yet been approved. She remains a citizen of Kyrgyzstan, as does his stepchild. His \nwife has almost daily contact with her mother and sisters and frequent contact with her \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbrother. Applicant provides monthly financial support to his wife\u2019s mother and sisters. \nBecause of Kyrgyzstan\u2019s threat of terrorism, human rights issues, and close relationship \nwith Russia and China there is a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, manipulation, \ninducement, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interests; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact through his spouse is not casual or infrequent. His wife has \ndaily contact with her mother and sisters and frequent contact with her brother. Applicant \nprovides monthly support to his wife\u2019s mother and sisters. Although there is not a question \nas to Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States, it would be a difficult choice to ask Applicant \nto choose between his loyalty toward his wife and her family and his country if there was \na conflict of interest. Applicant acknowledges the issues in the country of Kyrgyzstan that \nraise security concerns. Due to the issues, I am unable to find that it is unlikely that \nApplicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between his family and the \ninterests of the United States. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her SOR answer, Applicant denied all the allegations. I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for federal contractors since 2017. She served in the U.S. Air Force from 2004-2008. She was medically discharged (honorably) from the Air Force a few months shy of completing her enlistment. She received a disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and receives a monthly pension of approximately $825. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. She has been married and divorced twice. She has two children from her first marriage, ages 14 and 13. She has custody of both children, and one has special needs. She is currently engaged, and her fianc\u00e9e has two special needs children. They all live in the same household.

I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nfederal contractors since 2017. She served in the U.S. Air Force from 2004-2008. She \nwas medically discharged (honorably) from the Air Force a few months shy of completing \nher enlistment.

She has been married and divorced twice. She has two children from her first \nmarriage, ages 14 and 13. She has custody of both children, and one has special needs. \nShe is currently engaged, and her fianc\u00e9e has two special needs children. They all live in \nthe same household. (Tr.3 7, 18-19, 23, 27, 34-35; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent accounts (medical debts and consumer debts) \ntotaling approximately $75,900. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.f) The debts are established by credit \nreports from January 2019, July 2020, January 2021, May 2022, and December 2022. \n(GE 4-8) \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to several contributing factors. Her first \nhusband only made sporadic child support payments, often paying less than the court \nordered him to pay. She estimated that he was approximately $10,000 in arrears. She \nexpended about $50,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to contest her first husband\u2019s custody \nlitigation. Some of her SOR consumer debts are directly related to these fees. In her \nhearing testimony, she admitted all six underlying SOR debts, although she disputed \nsome of the fees and costs of the debts. She also has had medical procedures over the \nlast two years, which required her to miss work and take short-term disability, reducing \nher normal yearly gross income of $150,000 by about 40 percent ($60,000). (Tr.3 19-20, \n24-25, 28, 36; GE 2) \nApplicant and her fianc\u00e9e recently purchased a home valued at approximately $1.3 \nmillion. Their monthly payments are approximately $6,700.

She \nindicated that she had correspondence from the law firm establishing their relationship \nand payment plan. I asked her if she could provide it post-hearing and she said yes. She \ndid not provide any payment plan documentation. Post-hearing, she provided information \nthat she learned about the law firm she hired. She indicated the firm was no longer \noperating and had been sued for misconduct and malpractice. She stated she filed a \ncomplaint with the Better Business Bureau, but she did not supply any supporting \ndocumentation. (AE A) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$1,045. This is a medical debt. Applicant believes this was her second \nspouse\u2019s medical debt. Applicant paid this debt in 2020 or 2021. It does not appear on \nher three most recent credit reports.

This is a delinquent credit card. Applicant documented making \npayments toward this debt from May 2021 to October 2021 in the amount of $292 \nmonthly. She used the proceeds from her home sale in November 2021 to pay the \nremainder of the debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr.3 30-31; AE B-C) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f-$31,738; $21,486. These are two delinquent credit cards. The first \nmajor delinquency for these accounts were in October and December 2018. Applicant \nasserted that these were two of the accounts she hired the law firm to resolve. She \nbelieved the law firm disputed the debts. When asked to supply supporting \ndocumentation, she failed to do so. Both debts appear on her latest credit report. These \ndebts are not resolved. (Tr.3 31-32, 34, 40-41; GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e-$7,544. This is a delinquent credit card. The first major delinquency for \nthis account was in May 2019. Applicant asserted that this was an account she hired the \nlaw firm to resolve by setting up a payment plan. When asked to supply supporting \ndocumentation, she failed to do so. This debt appears on her latest credit report. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Tr.3 33, 34, 40-41; GE 8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. She incurred six delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $75,900. Three of the four largest debts remain unpaid. Applicant\u2019s \nhearing admissions and credit reports establish the debts. I find both disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although she paid \nthree of the debts, she failed to address the remaining debts, which comprise the greatest \nportion of the overall debt amount. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s custody battle, her former spouse\u2019s refusal to honor his child \nsupport allegation, her medical conditions, which caused a reduction in pay, and the \npossible misfeasance by the law firm she hired were circumstances beyond her control, \nshe did not act responsibly concerning the debts when she failed to follow up by \ncontacting her creditors. She claimed that the law firm was taking care of the debts, but \nshe failed to produce documentation that she actually contracted with any law firm. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling, other than her claim that \nshe hired a law firm. Her track record to date does not support a good financial picture. \nShe has had financial difficulties for a number of years. Based upon her past history, there \nis no reason to believe that she will right her financial ship in the near future. While she \ndid resolve three debts, these actions are too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, her VA disability, her family \ncircumstances, including parenting three special needs children, and her possible \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nvictimization by the law firm she hired to address her debts. However, I also considered \nthat she has not adequately addressed her delinquent debt and has not brought forward \nany plans to address the debt in light of her knowledge of the law firm\u2019s inaction on her \nbehalf. She has not established a meaningful track record of debt management, which \ncauses me to question her ability to resolve her debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered the \nexceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated June \n8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.d-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. She has never married and has a 24-year-old daughter. \nShe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997 and two master\u2019s degrees in 2017 and 2023. \nShe has been employed by the same federal contractor since 2000. (Tr. 16-17, 22, 24) \nApplicant testified that she was never educated about how to manage finances, \nand she has not always been a good steward of her money. She said she should have \nbeen more conscientious about managing her money. In 2013, she purchased a house. \nIn 2014, she decided to accept a different position within her company that paid her \napproximately $10,000 less than she was earning. She believed the new job had potential \nfor growth and was more career enhancing. When she accepted the job, she was unable \nto pay all of her bills because of the decrease in her income and chose not to do so. She \ntestified that from approximately 2015 to 2021, she did not make payments on the debts \nalleged in the SOR. (Tr. 28-34) \nApplicant testified that she missed some mortgage payments due to the reduction\nin her salary but was able to bring them current (SOR \u00b6 1.f-past due $1,241). (Tr. 27, 50-\n51; AE A, B, AE SOR F) \n \nIn 2017, Applicant\u2019s daughter graduated from high school and began college. \nApplicant testified that her daughter received financial aid and funded most of her own \ntuition. Applicant helped with tuition for the last two semesters when her daughter was \nattending part-time and was not eligible for financial aid. In February 2021, her daughter \ngave birth to a baby. They both live with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s daughter graduated in \nDecember 2022. Applicant presently provides some support for both her daughter and \ngranddaughter. Her daughter helps with some of the joint expenses. (Tr. 22-24, 49) \nApplicant\u2019s brother was diagnosed with cancer and moved in with her in \napproximately January 2017. He had medical insurance, and his expenses were paid but \nshe helped cover some of the incidentals associated with living with her. Her brother \npassed away in May 2020.

(Tr. 38, 42, 51-53, 83-84; AE P) \nIn March 2021 after receiving the SOR, Applicant paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \n($1,338), 1.h ($688), 1.i ($545), and 1.j ($194). These were for various consumer \npurchases. She used a portion of the inheritance money to pay these debts. (Tr. 32-36, \n52-53; AE C, AE SOR G, H, I, J) \nApplicant testified that she did not have the money to pay her remaining delinquent \ndebts. After receiving the SOR, she wanted to clear her credit and contacted some \ncreditors. From the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($4,764), 1.c ($4,057) and 1.e ($1,114), she \nreceived IRS Cancellation of Debt forms 1099C that she filed with her 2022 federal \nincome tax return. The income reported increased her federal income taxes by \napproximately $3,800. She was unable to pay the taxes when they were due and has a \npayment arrangement with the IRS. She is making $400 monthly payments until the taxes \nare paid. These debts were for delinquent credit cards. (Tr. 37-40, 44-47; AE SOR B, C, \nE) \nIn 2013, Applicant hired a local contractor to build a porch on her house. She \nsecured a loan of approximately $7,000 to $8,000. In approximately 2015, due to her \nreduced salary, she stopped paying the loan. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-past due $3,980 with total \nbalance of $5,142). She did not contact the creditor to discuss the debt or arrange a plan \nfor repayment after 2015. She received notifications from the creditor requesting \npayment. In July 2021, after receiving the SOR, Applicant used some of her inheritance \nfrom her brother and other funds to pay $5,434 and resolve the debt. (Tr. 27-32, 42-44; \nAE SOR A) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($1,503), 1.k ($1,097, 1.l \n($500), and 1.n ($139), she admitted all of them and stated that she would be contacting \nthe creditors to set up payment plans to satisfy the debts and would provide proof of t/heir \nresolution at her hearing. She testified that she thought she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nand requested the creditor provide her documents. Post-hearing, she provided a \nstatement saying she had verified the debt and was going to resolve it. (Tr. 49-50, 53-57; \nAE SOR D) \nApplicant testified that she did not have a payment plan with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 \n1.k. Post-hearing, she stated in the past she had tried to locate the creditor without \nsuccess. She has now found a contact number and will seek to resolve it. She testified \nthat she believed she paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l and would provide proof. Post-hearing, \nshe stated in the past she had tried to locate the creditor and was unable. She has now \nfound a contact number and will seek to resolve it. Applicant provided proof she paid the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.o in July 2021, after she received the SOR. (Tr. 49-50, 53-57; AE SOR \nK, L, O) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($252) and \nsaid she paid it years ago.

Post-\nhearing, she provided a statement saying she had contacted the creditor with whom she \nhad no communication since July 2016. She reiterated that she believed the debt was \nresolved, but they advised her there was a balance on the debt of $254 as of November \n2016 and had been sent to collection. She said the creditor believed that the collection \ncompany might have gone out of business. She was unsure how to resolve the debt. It is \nreflected on her July 2020 credit report. (Tr. 54-55; GE 3; AE SOR M) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she said she would contact the creditor in SOR \n\u00b6 1.n ($139), a medical account, and resolve it. She said she would provide proof of \npayment at her hearing. At her hearing, she stated she thought she paid the debt in 2020 \nor 2021. Post-hearing, she stated that she was unable to determine the creditor holding \nthe medical debt after diligently contacting her providers. She did not provide proof of \npayment. (Tr. 57-58; AE S) \nApplicant testified that her finances are much better, and she has been working \nhard to get her debts in order with a few exceptions. She stated she did not take into \naccount the impact her finances might have on her security clearance. She said she did \nnot realize that not paying her bills would affect her livelihood. She now pays most of her \nbills through automatic withdrawals. She is teaching her daughter about the \nconsequences associated with not being conscientious about paying bills on time. (Tr. \n58-59) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2020 security clearance application (SCA) she disclosed that \nshe purchased a computer in 2013 for approximately $3,160. She failed to make the \nrequired payments. She acknowledged the creditor began collection efforts. Applicant \ntestified that she had reached a payment agreement with the creditor, but a judgment was \nentered in March 2016. She made the payments in accordance with the judgment, and it \nwas paid in 2019. (Tr. 61-68; GE 1; AE Q) \nApplicant also disclosed in her 2020 SCA a garnishment order for a credit card \nwith an approximate balance owed of $4,744. Her pay was garnished until the balance \nwas paid in approximately 2018. (Tr. 64-68; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that when she completed her SCA, she retrieved a recent credit \nreport and was aware of her negative accounts. She stated in her SCA that she was \nworking with her creditors to repay her debts. She disclosed in her SCA the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j. She testified that after retrieving her \ncredit report she did not take action to resolve her debts with the creditors. She said she \nwas \u201cpurposefully blind to the situation that I was in.\u201d She did not seek financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 69-70) \nApplicant attributed some of her delinquent debts to the financial hardship created \nwhen her brother moved in with her in late 2017. (Tr. 37-38) She further stated: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI guess I thought at some point I would get better, do better, and be able to \npay them off. But truthfully, I think it was easier for me not to do it so I didn't. \nAnd I didn't see or think of the bigger picture of how it would hurt me in my \ncareer or hurt me with my security clearance. So it was an error in \njudgement on my part. I didn't see this happening, to be honest. (Tr. 39) \nApplicant also stated her financial hardship occurred because she chose to take a \njob that paid less to accept a new position. She initially indicated her pay cut was $6,000. \nAt her hearing, she said it was $10,000. Applicant was asked what actions she took \nregarding her financial situation after she completed her SCA, and she said she did not \ndo anything. (Tr. 38-40; GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2020. She \nacknowledged to the investigator most of the debts alleged in the SOR and that she had \nnot made payments on the debts after her reduction in pay in 2014 because of the \nadditional financial strain from her brother living with her. She acknowledged receiving \nphone calls from creditors and telling them she was going through a rough time. She said \nshe intended to pay all of her delinquent debts. (GE 2) \nApplicant funded her education with student loans. She testified that she owes \napproximately $100,000 for the degree she earned in 1997. She said she made some \npayments, but the loans were deferred over the years and are now under the pandemic \ndeferment. She received a scholarship for her first master\u2019s degree and owes $20,000 in \nstudent loans for the second. She said she has been in contact the student loan creditor \nand negotiated a monthly payment plan of $250 that is to begin in November 2023. She \nanticipates increasing that payment after she satisfies her tax debt with the IRS. (Tr. 17-\n22, 88-89) \nApplicant is embarrassed about her financial situation and has not sought financial \ncounseling. She testified that after her interview with the government investigator in 2020 \nshe did not hear anything about her security clearance or financial issues so she thought \nit was resolved. She stated: \u201cEven though I had requested the hearing I hadn't heard \nanything. So, I thought, well, everything's okay. I paid off the debts. They probably just \nreviewed it and we're good to go.\u201d (Tr. 78-79) She testified that she did not confirm her \nassumptions with her facility security officer (FSO). Post-hearing, Applicant said she \nspoke with her FSO about participating in financial counseling. (Tr. 69, 70, 78-80; AE S) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $97,000. She has about $1,300 in her bank account. \nShe previously had about $700 remaining after paying her bills, but it is now about $300 \nbecause she is making payments to the IRS. She stated that her payment should be \ncompleted in approximately March 2024. She has about $80,000 in a pension plan. In \n2021 her vehicle that she drove for 18 years was beyond repair, and she purchased a \nnew car for $44,730 and pays $880 a month. She said she found a car she liked and \npurchased it.

She saved \nand paid for the airline tickets (approximately $5,000) and hotel ($1,700) before the trip. \nShe estimated the costs of incidentals while on the trip such as rental car, food, drinks, \nand entertainment were $2,500. She used a credit card to pay for these expenditures. \nShe stated the balance on the card is about $4,000. The remaining amount was used for \nother purchases not associated with the trip. She explained she had not taken a vacation \nin a very long time and felt like she never gets to do anything. She did not think it was an \nissue because she paid for most of it up front and over time everything would be okay. \n(Tr. 71-80; AE S) \nIn June 2023, Applicant purchased a timeshare. The company provided her with a \ncredit card to make the $2,000 down payment that is interest free for nine months. She \nestimated the balance on the card is $2,500. The total cost of the timeshare was $13,000 \nand she has five years to pay it. Annual fees on the timeshare are $800. She thought it \nwould be a good idea because she would have a place to go. (Tr. 76-81 93-94; AE S) \nApplicant testified that her plan for maintaining her finances in the future is to \nreduce frivolous spending, such as eating out. She is considering getting a part-time job \nand she expects her daughter to share more of the household expenses. Post-hearing, \nshe said she obtained a part-time job. Applicant maintains a budget on a worksheet. Post-\nhearing, she provided a copy of it. She said she is taking strides to put herself in a better \nfinancial position. (Tr. 70-71, 89-91; AE R, S) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous debts that were delinquent for years that she failed to \nresolve or only did so after receiving the SOR. She made a choice to accept a lower \npaying job to enhance her career opportunities and then stopped paying her bills. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has been employed since 2000 by the same federal contractor. In 2014 \nshe made a choice to accept a lower-paying job with the potential to enhance her career \nopportunities. In approximately 2015, she stopped paying some of her bills because she \ncould not afford to pay them. Applicant\u2019s brother had cancer and moved in with her in \nJanuary 2017. The debts on the SOR were delinquent before Applicant\u2019s brother moved \nin with her. She testified that she incurred additional expenses because he lived with her, \nsuch as food costs and perhaps other essentials. Her brother passed away in May 2020. \nIn June 2020, she completed her SCA and was interviewed by a government investigator. \nShe disclosed some of her delinquent debts. She testified that she had not made any \npayments on any of the debts since 2015. In February 2021, she received the SOR. In \nMarch 2021, she made payments to resolve some of her delinquent debts. She also \ncontacted other creditors to clear her credit and received IRS Cancelation of Debt form \n1099C for those debts, which caused additional tax implications as it increased her \nincome. \nAfter receipt of the SOR, Applicant resolved some of her delinquent debts that \nwere six to seven years old. That is not a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors. \nHaving her debts canceled and paying the taxes on the income may remove them from \nher credit report but it does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve her debts. She did not address her delinquent finances until after her \nsecurity clearance was in jeopardy. She was aware of her delinquent debts when she \nwent to Hawaii and then purchased a timeshare in 2023. I cannot find her behavior is \nunlikely to recur. Her actions cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to accepting a lesser-paying job and \nbeing unaware of its impact. I do not find this condition was beyond her control. She made \nno effort to repay any of her delinquent debts until after she received the SOR. Although, \ncaring for her brother may have had some financial impact on her ability to repay some \nof her debts, he did not move in with her until January 2017. Her debts were already \ndelinquent. She used her inheritance money from him to pay some of the debts after she \nreceived the SOR. I cannot find that the conditions that caused her financial problems \nwere beyond her control. Based on her failure to address her remaining delinquent debts \nand her recent vacation and timeshare purchase, I cannot find she has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply \nApplicant has not had financial counseling and is embarrassed about her financial \nsituation. She admitted all of the debts in her answer to the SOR but during her hearing \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nshe disputed certain ones. I have considered that Applicant attempted to find the current \ncreditor or collection company for some of her debts and was unsuccessful. I have also \nconsidered that because of the length of time that the debts were delinquent it likely had \nan impact on finding the current holder of the debt or the possibility that it is no longer \nreported on her credit report. She has not provided documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of her dispute or evidence of actions to resolve the issue. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) do \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has not established a stable financial track record. The fact that she may \nhave resolved some debts \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). An applicant who waits until his or her clearance \nis in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those \nwith access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since August 2020. He was unemployed for about four months after he was laid off in April 2020. Prior to his current employment, he worked for another government contractor from 2009 until April 2020. He married in 1997, but he has been legally separated since October 2019. He and his estranged spouse have initiated divorce proceedings, but the divorce has not been finalized. He has a 20-year-old daughter. He has an associate\u2019s degree, has taken other college courses, but he has not earned another degree. (Tr. 12, 18-22, 46; GE 1, 6) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 20 delinquent credit cards and personal loans totaling approximately $141,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.v). It also alleged that he incurred these debts because of gambling losses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. (Tr. 13, 16-17, 23-24; SOR; Answer; GE 1-6) For at least 20 years, Applicant has lost a significant amount of money while gambling at casinos.

He was unemployed for about four months after he was laid \noff in April 2020. Prior to his current employment, he worked for another government \ncontractor from 2009 until April 2020. He married in 1997, but he has been legally \nseparated since October 2019. He and his estranged spouse have initiated divorce \nproceedings, but the divorce has not been finalized. He has a 20-year-old daughter. He \nhas an associate\u2019s degree, has taken other college courses, but he has not earned \nanother degree. (Tr. 12, 18-22, 46; GE 1, 6) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 20 delinquent credit cards and \npersonal loans totaling approximately $141,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.v). It also alleged that he \nincurred these debts because of gambling losses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Applicant \nadmitted the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. (Tr. 13, \n16-17, 23-24; SOR; Answer; GE 1-6) \nFor at least 20 years, Applicant has lost a significant amount of money while \ngambling at casinos. To fund his gambling, he took out personal loans and opened \ncredit cards. The SOR debts are all a result of his gambling. He hid his gambling and \nthe money he lost from his wife until about 2019. His gambling led to the breakdown of \nhis marriage. While it is not alleged in his SOR, he also borrowed $10,000 from his \nsisters to fund his gambling. He was delinquent on the mortgage for his marital \nresidence twice because of his gambling losses. Any adverse information not alleged in \nthe SOR, such as Applicant owing money to his sisters because of his gambling or his \nmortgage delinquencies, cannot be used for disqualification purposes; however, it may \nbe considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; in considering whether \nthe applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-\nperson concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He has not \ntaken any financial counseling or counseling for his gambling problem. He signed up for \ncounseling for his gambling problem in early 2020, but it was cancelled because of the \npandemic. He acknowledged that he signed up for this gambling counseling because he \nrealized his security clearance was in jeopardy. (Tr. 25-33; 44-46, 50; Answer; GE 1, 6) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has a problem with gambling, but he claimed \nthat he will not gamble again. He tried to stop gambling before but failed. As of the \nDOHA hearing, he last gambled in December 2022, when he went to a casino. He \nacknowledged that part of the reason he has not been gambling as much is that he \ndoes not have the money to do so. In May 2022, he entered into an agreement with a \ndebt consolidation company to pay off his SOR debts. He paid the debt consolidation \ncompany a little over $1,000 for disbursement to the SOR creditors. However, in June \n2022, he withdrew from the agreement because he wanted to pay back the $10,000 he \nowed to his sisters first. He provided no evidence that any of the money he provided to \nthe debt consolidation company was disbursed to creditors. He provided no documents \nto corroborate his dealings with the debt consolidation company or any payments to \ncreditors made on his behalf. He claimed that he plans to work with a credit \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsolidation company again to pay off his delinquencies. (Tr. 16-17, 22-23, 32-38, 50-\n51; GE 1-6) \nApplicant claimed that he satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through an involuntary \ngarnishment on an unspecified date. He provided no documentation to corroborate this \ninformation and the Government\u2019s credit reports do not reflect that this debt has been \nsatisfied. The 2023 credit report reflects a lower balance than the SOR. I find he is \nresolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through an involuntary garnishment. Except for the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.u, he has had no contact with any of the creditors of the SOR debts. The \ncreditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.u contacted him in about November 2022, but he did \nnot make a payment arrangement because he did not have enough money to do so. \nExcept for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, he has not resolved any of the SOR debts. He claimed \nthat in about December 2022, he paid his sisters back the $10,000 he owed them. He \ndid not corroborate this claim with documentation. (Tr. 39-46, 50; GE 1-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts; and \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused \nby gambling. \nApplicant has 20 delinquent debts totaling about $141,000 that resulted from \ngambling losses. For years, he hid his gambling-related financial problems from his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwife. His gambling led to the breakup of his marriage. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide \nevidence in mitigation. \nThe allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1.b reference a partial sum of Applicant\u2019s \ngambling losses that are listed in the other SOR allegations. That paragraph is \nduplicative of the other SOR allegations. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. The \nevidence does not show that the debts are resolved or are under control. He has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. He has not taken counseling for \ngambling, and he gambled at a casino as recently as December 2022 after trying to \nstop. He has not provided sufficient evidence that his gambling problem is under \ncontrol. I cannot find his financial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his gambling. These conditions \nwere not beyond his control. The only payments he has made on an SOR debt have \nbeen through an involuntary garnishment. Payments through involuntary garnishment \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndo not establish a good-faith payment. He has not made any payment on the 19 other \nSOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nWhile Applicant engaged a debt consolidation company, there is no evidence \nthat this company is a legitimate and credible source of financial counseling. Moreover, \nfor the same reasons AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply, I conclude that his financial problems \nare not being resolved and are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has not disputed the legitimacy of any of the SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. None of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply. He has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.v: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.h, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1,d, and 1.g. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review of the pleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old. He was married in 2001, and has two children, one who is a minor. He earned a associates degree in about 2008. He has worked for a defense contractor for about 15 years as a designer of mechanical parts. (TR. 21-23; GE 1) Applicant stated that he started taking college classes at a for-profit school in about 2006. He reported that he was working as a janitor at that time, and had a difficult time earning enough money to support his family. He stated that the school recruiter induced him to add extra courses to his studies to increase the value of his degree. He asserted that the information that he was provided was false, and these additional classes just increased his costs. He reported that in 2008, he had to make a $9000 lump sum payment to the school, because they threatened to remove him shortly before he earned his degree. He stated that he took this money from his savings, and it created a financial hardship for his family.

On \nMarch 30, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant responded to the SOR on August 11, 2021, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 6, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened on October 20, 2022.

He timely submitted documents that I marked as AE E-K and \nadmitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.h, and denied SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1,d, and 1.g. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He was married in 2001, and has two children, one who \nis a minor. He earned a associates degree in about 2008. He has worked for a defense \ncontractor for about 15 years as a designer of mechanical parts. (TR. 21-23; GE 1) \nApplicant stated that he started taking college classes at a for-profit school in about \n2006. He reported that he was working as a janitor at that time, and had a difficult time \nearning enough money to support his family. He stated that the school recruiter induced \nhim to add extra courses to his studies to increase the value of his degree. He asserted \nthat the information that he was provided was false, and these additional classes just \nincreased his costs. He reported that in 2008, he had to make a $9000 lump sum payment \nto the school, because they threatened to remove him shortly before he earned his \ndegree. He stated that he took this money from his savings, and it created a financial \nhardship for his family. (Tr. 24-25, 32-34, 41-43; GE 3, 4, 5, 6) \nIn 2022, the U.S. Department of Education approved $3.9 billion to discharge the \nstudent loans for students who attended this school from 2005 through 2016, before it \nwas forced to shut down. Some of the reasons cited for the discharge were the lies and \nfalse promises made to students, and that the school intentionally mislead students and \ninduced them to take student loans they would be unable to afford. (AE A, H, J)  \nApplicant stated that over the last ten years, his children have required expensive \nmedical treatment for chronic medical conditions. This treatment included surgery for his \ndaughter in 2012, and a medical device for his son in 2016. He reported that these \nunexpected medical expenses created a financial hardship for his family, and they were \nunable to afford to pay the full costs of this medical treatment at the time it was obtained. \n(Tr. 20, 23-25, 34-37, 44-46; GE 2) \nThe SOR alleges about $35,000 of delinquent debt. This includes: $6,104 of \nmedical debt, $28,621 of student loan debt, and $908 for one consumer debt in collection. \nThe status of the allegations is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f are medical debts in collection for $108; $108; $1,138; $3,800; \n$715; and $235, respectively. Applicant claimed that \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were for x-rays, \u00b6 1.d \nwas for his daughter\u2019s surgery, and \u00b6 1.e was for his son\u2019s medical device. He stated that \nhe could not discern the origin of \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. He reported that he was unable to pay \nall of the medical expenses up front.

He claimed that he called the creditors to set up a payment plan but was \nreferred to the collection agencies. He stated that when he contacted the collection \nagencies, he found that they had inflated some of the balances. He claimed that he \ncontacted the original creditor to determine the origin of the additional charges, and they \ntold him that these charges were not part of their bill. Applicant stated that he came to \nbelieve that the collection agency was trying to gouge him, and he stopped working with \nthem. At hearing, he was asked why he did not try to settle the medical debt for a lower \namount, and he stated that he did not know that he could do that. He stated that these \ncommunications were done over the phone and that he does not have documentation of \nthe contacts with these creditors. In a post-hearing submission, he provided a receipt \nshowing a $1,200 payment for a medical debt, and a payment plan to pay $1,779 of a \nmedical debt in $99 monthly installments. (Tr. 20, 23-25, 34-37, 44-46; AE E, I; GE 2, 3, \n4, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a debt in collection to a cellular phone service provider for $908. \nApplicant denies this debt. He stated that he had had poor cellular service at his home, \nand transferred his service to another carrier. He claimed that the original provider billed \nhim for a phone for which he had already paid. He claimed that shortly after receiving the \nbill, he disputed the charge. He asserted that the provider never took action on his dispute \nand moved the debt into collection. He stated that he has no documentation from the \ndispute, because it was done over the phone. (Tr. 43-44; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a student loan in collection for $28,261. Applicant reported that after \ngraduation, he had a forbearance on his student loan repayments. He claimed that once \nthe forbearance ended, he made two monthly loan payments of about $600, and then the \nmonthly payment was raised to over $1,000 monthly. He stated that he was unable to \nafford this amount and stopped making payments. The record shows that the first major \ndelinquency for his student loans was in 2016, and they went into collection status. He \nstated that in 2019, in an effort to resolve his delinquent debts, he requested forbearance \nfrom the lender to remove the loans from collection status. In 2022, Applicant was \ncontacted by the Department of Education about the student loan discharge program for \nformer students from the for-profit school. He applied for discharge of his student loans, \nand it was approved. This debt is now resolved. (TR. 24-25, 32-34, 37-40, 41-43; AE A, \nH, J; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s budget shows that he and his wife\u2019s finances are stable, and they can \nafford their monthly expenses. Their current monthly income exceeds their expenses by \nabout $1,000. (AE G) \nApplicant submitted some employment records, and three character references \nwhich state that he is a good and hardworking employee, involved in the community, and \nis trustworthy.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply.  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \nApplicant\u2019s student loans are now resolved. The Department of Education \ndetermined that the students who were eligible for discharge had been lied to, told false \npromises about their education, and were misled to take out more loans than they could \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nafford. Applicant\u2019s medical debts were for treatment for his minor children and occurred \ndue to circumstances beyond his control. He responsibly attempted to resolve the medical \ndebt and the cellular phone service debt with his creditors, and disputed the latter debt. \nApplicant has made payment arrangements on the medical debts. These debts occurred \nlong ago and under circumstances unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b) \napply. \nApplicant credibly testified and provided documentation that he has undertaken \ngood-faith efforts to address his debts. Applicant is not required to show that he has paid \nor resolved all of his debts, or that he has done so in any particular way. He has shown \nthat he has a reasonable plan to resolve his debts and has implemented it. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his employment records and character letters. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial hardships did not arise out of irresponsible behavior or \ndeliberately becoming financially overextended. He took action to address his delinquent \ndebts, and did the best that he could for his particular circumstances. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations \nand personal conduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 50, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting company, since September 2014. He was initially granted access to classified information in March 1999. On his most recent application, submitted in dated July 2019, he disclosed six alcohol-related criminal incidents for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. The investigation revealed that he was also stopped for traffic violations in April 2015, June 2018, and June 2019. (Tr. 27-28; GE 1) 2 Applicant admits that he was arrested in November 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a/ GE 3; Answer), November 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.b/ GE 10), April 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), July 2013 (SOR \u00b61.d/ GE 4), April 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.e/ Answer), and June 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.g/ GE 6) for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Applicant also admits that during each stop he refused to take a breathalyzer test, which resulted in his arrest. With the exception of the charges against Applicant after the July 2013 arrest, the criminal cases from the five other arrests were nolle prossed. In response to the July 2013 charges, Applicant pleaded guilty to driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol and was sentenced to probation before judgment. Applicant also admits that he received a citation in December 2016 for having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle, which a police officer noticed while admonishing Applicant for a parking violation. (SOR \u00b6 1.f/ GE 5; Answer) He received a fine, which he paid. (Tr. 33-37, 40, 43-44;",

This \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as \nwell as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented \non June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \na determination whether to grant his security clearance. Applicant timely answered the \nSOR and requested a decision on the administrative record without a hearing. (Answer) \nThe Government, exercising its right under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 \nE3.1.7, requested a hearing, and informed Applicant of this election in a letter dated \nJanuary 18, 2022. The hearing conversion letter is included in the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. \nIn advance of the hearing, the Government served Applicant with the documents \nit planned to use in its case against him. The disclosure letter, dated March 11, 2022, is \nincluded in the record as HE II. The hearing convened on January 12, 2023. I admitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, without objection. Applicant provided several \ndocuments to offer into evidence; however, they were duplicates of the documents he \nsubmitted with his answer to the statement of reasons. I advised the parties that the \ndocuments were already considered part of the record and that I would not admit the \nduplicate copies into the record. I destroyed the duplicate documents in accordance with \nDOD policy. DOHA received the transcript on January 23, 2023, and the record closed. \nProcedural Matters \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the \nrecord and to correct clerical errors. Specifically, Department Counsel moved to amend \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.c, and 2.d to correct the allegations. Applicant was not arrested, but \nreceived citations for incidents that occurred in December 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and January \n2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.c), respectively. The Government also moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2.d to \nreflect that Applicant was not arrested but received a citation after a June 2019 incident. \nThe Government also sought to strike the second sentence of the allegation, because it \ncontained incorrect information about the resolution of the case. I amended the \nallegations without objection from Applicant. (Tr. 12-15) \nDuring the hearing, both parties made multiple references to the implied consent \nlaw in Applicant\u2019s state of residence. However, neither party offered the statute for\ninclusion in the record. The statute is included in the record as HE III, so as not to reveal\nApplicant\u2019s state of residence in the decision. A copy of the statute was sent to the parties.\n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 50, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting company, \nsince September 2014. He was initially granted access to classified information in March \n1999. On his most recent application, submitted in dated July 2019, he disclosed six \nalcohol-related criminal incidents for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. \nThe investigation revealed that he was also stopped for traffic violations in April 2015, \nJune 2018, and June 2019.

Applicant also admits that during each \nstop he refused to take a breathalyzer test, which resulted in his arrest. With the exception \nof the charges against Applicant after the July 2013 arrest, the criminal cases from the \nfive other arrests were nolle prossed. In response to the July 2013 charges, Applicant \npleaded guilty to driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol and was sentenced to \nprobation before judgment. Applicant also admits that he received a citation in December \n2016 for having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle, which a police officer noticed \nwhile admonishing Applicant for a parking violation. (SOR \u00b6 1.f/ GE 5; Answer) He \nreceived a fine, which he paid. (Tr. 33-37, 40, 43-44; GE 3; Answer) \nApplicant admits he received a citation in April 2015, in an incident separate from \nthe April 2015 DUI arrest, for driving on a suspended license \u2013 the charge was nolle \nprocessed. (SOR \u00b6 2.b/ GE 7; Answer) He admits receiving a citation in January 2018 for \ndriving nearly 30 miles per hour over the speed limit. He was fined. (SOR \u00b6 2.c/ GE 8) He \nalso admits that he received a third citation in June 2019 for driving over 20 miles per \nhour over the speed limit and driving on a suspended license. He was convicted of the \nspeeding violation and received probation before judgment. The charge for driving on a \nsuspended license was nolle prossed. (SOR \u00b6 2.d/GE 9) (Tr. 43-44, 48, 52-53, 67-68) \nDuring each stop for suspicion of DUI, Applicant refused to take breathalyzer tests, \nbecause he did not believe that he was intoxicated. He also wanted to \u201cprove his \ninnocence\u201d in court. He testified that he was also advised by his friends employed in law \nenforcement to refuse to provide a breath sample. He believed that the consumption of \none beer would be enough to render a result above the legal limit. He testified that he \nwas not aware that refusal to take a breathalyzer test could result in the suspension of \nhis license. He claims that the two times he was cited for driving on a suspended license, \nhe was unaware of the suspension because he still had his driver\u2019s license in his \npossession. (Tr. 41-43, 50, 62, 64-66, 68) \nApplicant testified that before all of the alleged alcohol-related driving incidents, he \nconsumed between two and four beers while socializing with friends, usually while \nwatching football games. Each time he was stopped, he claims that it was for speeding, \nnot erratic driving. However, on two occasions, in April 2015 and June 2018, he was \napproached by police officers after sitting in his car on the side of the road. In the April \n2015 incident, Applicant pulled off the road because he felt tired while driving after leaving \na friend\u2019s business where he consumed alcohol. In the June 2018 incident, Applicant \npulled over because he started feeling unwell while driving home from a social event \nwhere he had been consuming alcohol. He was less than five miles from home. The police \nofficer approached Applicant\u2019s vehicle because the car was partially blocking a lane of \ntraffic. He does not believe that alcohol affected his ability to drive in either incident. (Tr. \n29-33, 37-39, 49-50) \nApplicant does not believe that he has a problem with alcohol. He has not been \nordered by the court or advised by family members to take any alcohol education classes. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNor has he taken any on his own. When asked about losing a job in 2010 because of \nattendance issues, Applicant admitted that he often took Mondays off during football \nseason. He denied needing the days off to recover after drinking too much, but because \nhe was too tired after staying up late watching football. Applicant was terminated from \nanother job in July 2013 for attendance issues. The termination occurred shortly after he \nwas arrested for DUI. He claims that his termination was not related to any alcohol \nconsumption issues, but that he frequently took time off to look for a higher paying job. \nHe also admitted that after the June 2018 incident, he and his wife decided that it would \nbe best if she accompanied him to future social gatherings. She does not drink and agreed \nto drive him. (TR. 62, 64-65, 56-59) \nApplicant\u2019s state of residency enacted an informed consent law in 1977. Under the \nstatute any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on \nany private property that issued by the public in general in the State is deemed to have \nconsented to provide a breath or blood sample to determine alcohol concentration, if they \nare detained on a suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of \nalcohol or while impaired by alcohol. Although a person cannot be forced to provide a \nbreath sample, they are advised by the detailing officer that failure to do so will result in \na suspension of their driver\u2019s license by the State\u2019s motor vehicle administration. An \nofficer is only directed to confiscate a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license if they are suspected of \noperating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or impaired by alcohol in violation of an \nalcohol restriction order or if operating a commercial vehicle. (See HE III) \nIn April 2022, Applicant suffered a medical event that left him unable to drive or \nwork for an indeterminate amount of time. Given his current medical condition, he cannot \ndrink alcohol. While serious, Applicant\u2019s medical condition could improve enough for him \nto resume his regular activities. (Tr. 56-58, 62-63) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness. The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case. \nBetween 2008 and 2018, Applicant had seven alcohol-related criminal incidents, resulting \nin six arrests, one DUI conviction, and a fine for having an open container of alcohol in \nhis car. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g) Despite his statements to the contrary, Applicant\u2019s history of \nalcohol-related criminal conduct is evidence of a maladaptive relationship with alcohol. \nHis repeated decisions to drive after consuming alcohol and to do so in excess of the \nspeed limit show the adverse effect of alcohol on his judgment. Accordingly, the following \nalcohol consumption disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 22(a), alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnoses with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol\nuse disorder.  \n \n \nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol consumption \nconcerns. Although he is currently abstaining from alcohol, that decision was not borne \nout of an acknowledgment of his maladaptive relationship with alcohol, but out of medical \nnecessity. As such, his current period of abstinence does not mitigate the alcohol concern \nin this case. Applicant does not believe that he has an alcohol problem. Despite his arrest \nrecord, he has never availed himself to any alcohol education classes or substance abuse \ncounseling. Given that he is unable to acknowledge the maladaptive nature of his \nrelationship with alcohol, he is likely to resume his alcohol consumption at a similar level \nwhen his health improves. \nCriminal Conduct \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant\u2019s six alcohol-related arrests, the \nSeptember 2013 guilty plea, and the open container violation is also alleged under this \nguideline (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g, 2.a), in addition to a 2015 arrest for driving on a suspended \nlicense (nolle prosequi), and 2018 and 2019 misdemeanor convictions for speeding. His \ncriminal record demonstrates a pattern of behavior that is indicative of poor judgment and \na blatant disregard for the law, rules, and regulations. Accordingly, the following \ndisqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 31(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant claimed that he was innocent of \nfive of the six charges of driving under the influence. However, he did not provide reliable \nevidence to support a finding that he did not commit the charged offenses. He cites as \nproof of innocence the absence of breathalyzer test results to establish his intoxication, \nand that five suspicion of DUI cases were nolle prosessed. While breathalyzer results are \ndirect evidence of intoxication, they are not the only type of evidence required to meet a \nstate prosecutor\u2019s burdens of proof and production in a criminal case. A prosecutor\u2019s \ndecision to abandon prosecution or a court\u2019s decision to dismiss charges against a \ndefendant does not equate to a finding of innocence. There are many reasons unrelated \nto a determination of guilt that the state may choose to not prosecute a criminal case. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe criminal concern is not mitigated by the fact that Applicant no longer engages \nin the underlying conduct, consuming alcohol or driving a car, due to the state of his health \nat the time of the hearing. It is possible, as his health improves, that Applicant may resume \nthese activities. Given that he has not demonstrated rehabilitation of his alcohol issue or \ndemonstrated an understanding of the safety concerns raised by his driving record, he \ndid not establish that the underlying conduct is unlikely to recur. As a result of Applicant\u2019s \nview toward his criminal history, the passage of time since his last incident of criminal \nconduct, four years, is not sufficient to mitigate the criminal conduct concerns in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nAfter reviewing the record and considering Applicant\u2019s testimony, doubts about his \nongoing security worthiness remain. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered \nthe whole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). In addition to the security concerns raised by the \nalleged misconduct, I am also concerned about the implications of intentional disregard \nof the implied consent law in his state. \nThe security clearance adjudications are a predictive process by which an \nindividual\u2019s past behavior is used as an indicator of his future conduct. Here, Applicant \ndemonstrated an unwillingness to comply with rule and regulations related to the privilege \nof maintaining a driver\u2019s license. Applicant testified that he routinely refused to provide \nbreath samples when stopped by law enforcement on suspicion of DUI. Applying the \nprinciple that government officials act with good-faith and regularity in the execution of \ntheir duties, it is more likely than not that Applicant was advised of the consequences of \nhis failure to provide the requested sample. His refusal to participate indicates that he will \nnot voluntarily comply with reasonable, lawful requests when they could result in adverse \nconsequences. Similarly, the rules regarding the safeguarding of classified information \nrequire an individual to voluntarily submit to processes that may result in adverse \nconsequences. This when considered with the alleged disqualifying conduct, supports a \nnegative whole-person assessment of unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \nand other characteristics indicating that he may not properly handle or safeguard \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for \na security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 1, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On March 8, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and \ndetailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1 \n\n \n                                                             \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated March 16, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR, \nand she requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on May 17, 2021. Because of the \nhealth protection protocols associated with COVID-19, hearings were essentially placed \non hold. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2022. A Notice of Microsoft TEAMS \nVideo Teleconference Hearing was issued on August 1, 2022, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on August 24, 2022. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were marked and admitted \ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified, but did not submit any documentation. \nThe transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on September 1, 2022. I kept the record \nopen to enable Applicant to supplement it, something that she claimed she intended to \ndo, but she failed to submit any of the documentation that was discussed during the \nhearing. (Tr. at 82-85) The record closed on September 14, 2022. \nRulings on Procedure \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take Administrative Notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the Republic of the Philippines (Philippines), appearing in \nextracts of nine written submissions issued by various U.S. Government sources. Facts \nare proper for Administrative Notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized \nsource and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on \nsource information regarding the Philippines in publications of the Department of State, \nthe Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n10, 2004)); and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 \n(3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, \nis to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, \nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts \nfor administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 \n(2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents).   \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below \nunder the Foreign Influence Section, found in the Philippines subsection. However, while \nI do not reject the facts set forth in the press releases issued by the U.S. Department of \nJustice, any inference that Applicant or her family participated in criminal activity was not \nargued by the Government and is specifically rejected. \n2 \n\n \n                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all of the \nallegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n.). The information in \nher Answer to the SOR is incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of \nthe evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old Philippine-born naturalized U.S. citizen. She became a \nU.S. citizen in August 1995 and relinquished her Philippine citizenship. She is a 1986 high \nschool graduate with some college credits but no degree. From 1994 until 1998, she \nresided with her husband \u2013 a native-born U.S. citizen then employed by the U.S. \nGovernment \u2013 in Singapore, where she also worked in an unspecified position with the \nU.S. Air Force. She has been employed as a payroll support analyst by a government \ncontractor and was initially assigned to a U.S. Government facility in the Philippines from \nDecember 1998 until late in 2019. In early 2020, her position moved to the United States, \nand she has served in identical positions for the U.S. Government handling the portfolios \nfirst for Afghanistan and then for Iraq. She has never served in the U.S. military. She has \nnever held a security clearance. She was married in 1991 and widowed in 2014. She has \ntwo adopted adult children, both of whom were born biologically to her brother. \n \nBackground  \nForeign Influence \nAs noted above, Applicant was born and raised in the Philippines. Her parents, \nboth now deceased (her mother died in 2019 and her father died in 2022), were Philippine \ncitizen-residents. (GE 1 at 16; GE 2 at 3; Tr. at 44) Her two children are Philippine citizen-\nresidents where they are both graduate students. (Tr. at 37-39) She generally checks on \nthem almost daily by either phone or text. Three of her four brothers are Philippine citizen-\nresidents: one was a merchant marine/assistant chef on a cruise ship before the \npandemic who became a construction worker; one, the biological father of her children, \nis a computer technician; one is an engine mechanic for a subcontractor with the \nPhilippine Navy who also is a public tricycle operator. She rarely communicates with her \nbrothers except when she visits the Philippines. (Tr. at 44-48) She also has a brother who \nis a Canadian citizen-resident who was previously working on the Philippine National \nPolice bomb squad before approximately 2005-2007, when he immigrated to Canada and \nnow works in private security. (Tr. at 53-55) Two of her three sisters are Philippine citizen-\nresidents: one is a human resources specialist with a fashion house; one is a physical \ntherapist; and the third sister is a Philippine citizen residing and working in Hong Kong in \na management position with a technical company. She periodically communicates with \nher sisters. (Tr. at 49-51) Applicant also has two half-siblings \u2013 a teen-aged brother and \nan adult sister, both of whom are Philippine citizen-residents. She has not spoken with \nher half-sister since 2019. (Tr. at 51-53) \nIn addition to family members, since 2018, Applicant has had a boyfriend who is a \nPhilippine citizen-resident. He is an attorney in private practice who, before they met, \nserved as a city fiscal or prosecutor \u2013 much like a district attorney.

She remains close to her best friend and one other of the four \u2013 \ncommunicating with them once or twice a month \u2013 but rarely communicates with the other \ntwo (former high school classmates) now that she resides in the United States. Her best \nfriend is in sales. (Tr. at 55-56) \nOther than one brother\u2019s subcontractor-relationship with the Philippine Navy; one \nbrother\u2019s former relationship with the Philippine National Police bomb squad; and her \nboyfriend\u2019s former position as a city fiscal or prosecutor, no member of Applicant\u2019s family \nor friends has a past or current relationship with the Philippine government, military, \nsecurity, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence services. \nApplicant supports her son by periodically sending him money, paying his school \ntuition in full, and paying for his housing. (Tr. at 52-53) She also maintains financial \ninterests in the Philippines. She and her late husband purchased land and built a house \non the property. Her daughter currently resides in the house. She refinanced the property \nand it is now under contract to sell or was already sold for about $490,196. She intends \nto use the proceeds to pay off her late mother\u2019s medical debts, pay off her children\u2019s \nschool expenses, purchase land for a retirement home, and use $10,000 in the United \nStates. She intended to keep any remaining funds in a local bank as a source for the \npurchase of her future retirement home. (Tr. at 59, 60-63, 66-67; GE 2 at 7-8) She did not \nsubmit any documentation to support her contention that the property either is under \ncontract or has been sold. \nIn 2016, she purchased a condominium in which her son now resides. She intends \nto pay off the remaining mortgage once the sale of the house is completed. The \ncondominium is now worth about $119,584. (Tr. at 59-61; GE 2 at 7) She and her late \nhusband purchased land with a small house where her father resided with her half-\nbrother. The house is now unoccupied. The house and property are now worth \nsomewhere between $35,000 and $78,000. (Tr. at 61, 64; GE 2 at 7) \nApplicant previously had various bank accounts in the Philippines, but now all but \none of those accounts appear to have been closed. (Tr. at 65-67) Applicant owns a \ntownhouse in the United States and maintains one credit union account. (Tr. at 33-34) \nHer late husband\u2019s DOD retirement benefits go directly to her credit union in the United \nStates. (Tr. at 68) \nPhilippines \nThe U.S. and the Philippines maintain a close relationship stemming from the U.S. \ncolonial period (1898-1946), the bilateral security alliance bound by the Mutual Defense \nTreaty of 1951, and common strategic and economic interests. Relations are based on \nstrong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and human \nrights. In 1946, the United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state and \nestablished diplomatic relations. The U.S. has since designated the Philippines as a Major \nNon-NATO Ally. Former U.S. President Barack Obama visited the Philippines in 2014 to \nreaffirm the United States' commitment to the security alliance, and to discuss the United \n4 \n\n \n                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStates' strategic vision for the bilateral relationship. President Obama noted the two \nnations' strong people-to-people ties, commitment to peace and stability in the Asia-\nPacific region, and commitment to build prosperity for our people and the global economy. \nAlthough the U.S. closed its military bases in the Philippines in 1992, the two \nnations have maintained security cooperation ever since. The Manila Declaration, signed \nin 2011, reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation \nfor a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. Since 2012, the Philippines \nhas played a key role in the U.S. goal of rebalancing foreign policy priorities to Asia, \nparticularly as maritime territorial disputes between China and other claimants in the \nSouth China Sea have intensified. \nIn 2014, the two countries confirmed agreement of an Enhanced Defense \nCooperation Agreement (EDCA), which helps promote the peace and stability that has \nunderpinned Asia's remarkable economic growth over the past six decades. The EDCA \nallows for the increased presence of U.S. military forces, ships, aircraft, and equipment \nin the Philippines on a nonpermanent basis and greater U.S. access to Philippine military \nbases. As part of the security alliance, Members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have \nconducted Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercises with the \nArmed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) since 1995. The training exercises develop strong \npartnerships that contribute to the greater peace and stability of the region and allow both \nnations to gain valuable experience and increase our interoperability. The U.S. and the \nPhilippines have the same mission, that is, to further strengthen the Philippines' security \noperations and maritime domain awareness capabilities. The U.S. has begun to provide \n$40 million in technical expertise, training, and equipment through the Global Security \nContingency Fund. The U.S. is also helping to construct a Philippine National Coast \nWatch Center in Manila. \nIn the past decade, the Philippines has been one of the largest recipients of U.S. \nforeign assistance in Southeast Asia, including over $143 million following Typhoon \nYolanda (Haiyan) in 2013. U.S. assistance in the Philippines fosters broad-based \neconomic growth; improves the health and education of Filipinos; promotes peace and \nsecurity; advances democratic values, good governance, and human rights; and \nstrengthens regional and global partnerships. The U.S. and the Philippines have a strong \ntrade and investment relationship, with over $25 billion in goods and services traded. As \nthe Philippine's third-largest trading partner, the U.S. is one of the nation\u2019s largest foreign \ninvestors. The Philippines has been among the largest beneficiaries of the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences program for developing countries, which provides preferential \nduty-free access to the U.S. market. In 1989, the two countries signed a bilateral Trade \nand Investment Framework Agreement and a tax treaty. \nAn enhanced engagement of 15 U.S. government agencies is aiming to address \nthe most significant constraints to growth in the Philippines and to stimulate inclusive \neconomic expansion through a Partnership for Growth (PFG). USAID and the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation account for the majority of PFG financial resources amounting to \nmore than $750 million. The two countries have made enormous strides in deepening the \neconomic linkages between them, including: Removal of the Philippines from the Special \n301 Watch List, based on significant advances in the protection and enforcement of \n5 \n\n \n                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nintellectual property rights and considerable progress on worker rights issues in the \nPhilippines, which will allow the U.S. government to close a Generalized System of \nPreferences (GSP) review of worker rights in the Philippines without any change to the \nPhilippines' GSP trade benefits. \nThe Philippines and the U.S. share extensive people-to-people ties. About 350,000 \nAmericans reside in the Philippines, and approximately 600,000 U.S. citizens visit the \ncountry each year. There are approximately four million people of Philippine descent in \nthe U.S. The Philippines has the world's oldest continuous operating Fulbright program: \nthe Philippine-American Educational Foundation, established in 1948. The U.S. has had \na Peace Corps program in the Philippines for over 50 years. \nThe Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. \nFormer President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, elected in May 2016, began his constitutionally \nlimited six-year term in June 2016. In May 2022, he was succeeded by President \nFerdinand Romualdez Marcos, Jr. (Bongbong), son of Former President Ferdinand \nMarcos Sr. His newly-elected Vice President is Sara Vicenta Zimmerman Duterte-Carpio \n(Inday Sara), daughter of Former President Duterte. \nA number of Americans, including Leandro Aragoncillo, a former intelligence \nanalyst with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who also served as a staff assistant \nin the Office of the Vice President, have been convicted of espionage, or espionage-\nrelated crimes, involving transmission of information to the Philippines. According to the \nU.S. Department of Justice, there have been numerous criminal cases concerning export \nenforcement related to the Philippines. However, the most significant focus is on terrorism \nand human rights issues in the Philippines. \nAs of February 2021, the U.S. Department of State travel advisory for the \nPhilippines is Level 3: Reconsider Travel Due to COVID-19. Additionally, Exercise \nIncreased Caution due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping. It directed \nAmericans: Do Not Travel to the Sulu Archipelago, including the southern Sulu Sea, due \nto \ncrime, \nterrorism, \ncivil \nunrest, \nand \nkidnapping \nand \nto \nMarawi \nCity in Mindanao due to terrorism and civil unrest. It noted that the Philippine government \nhas declared a State of National Emergency on Account of Lawless Violence in \nMindanao. \nPhilippine government law enforcement agencies are engaged in a nationwide \ncounternarcotic campaign that has resulted in a sharp increase in violence between police \nand individuals suspected of involvement in the drug trade. As part of this campaign, law \nenforcement is engaged in aggressive search and buy-bust operations that could affect \nforeigners. The U.S. Department of State has assessed Manila as being a high-threat \nlocation for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. Terrorist \nviolence continues to affect primarily the Mindanao region, in the country\u2019s south. In 2019, \nthe Philippines made the lists of the top 10 countries with the most terrorist incidents (351) \nand the most terrorist casualties (1,192 which is 3 percent of the global total). \n6 \n A variety of terrorist groups operate in the Philippines. For more than a decade, \nterrorists, insurgents, and criminal actors have carried out major attacks against civilians. \n\n \n                                                             \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nIn 2019, the Philippines made the list of the top 10 countries with the most terrorist \nincidents and the most terrorist casualties. There were 351 incidents in the Philippin\nwith 1,192 casualties (3 percent of the global total of casualties). The most deadly attack \ninvolved a bombing of a Mass at the Jolo Cathedral in Sulu killing 23 people and wounding \n102. Multiple suicide bombings in the Philippines were a new phenomenon for the region. \nOn August 24, 2020, dual suicide bombings in Jolo, Sulu and Mindanao, killed 15 people \nand injured 77 others. \n \nThe State Department designated the Philippines a major money-laundering \njurisdiction in 2019. The Philippines\u2019 growing economy and geographic location within key \ntrafficking routes place it at elevated risk of money laundering and terrorism financing. \nRecent growth in the online gaming industry also presents increased risk. Corruption and \nhuman trafficking constitute some of the principal sources of criminal proceeds. Insurgent \ngroups operating in the Philippines derive funding from kidnapping for ransom and \nnarcotics and arms trafficking. Additionally, the large volume of remittances from Filipinos \nliving abroad increases the monitoring burden on anti-money laundering authorities. \nIn its most recent annual human rights report, the State Department reported that \nsignificant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including \nextrajudicial killings, by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; reports of \nforced disappearance by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; torture \nby and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; arbitrary detention by and on \nbehalf of the government and non-state actors; harsh and life-threatening prison \nconditions; arbitrary and unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with the \nindependence of the judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression and the \npress, including violence, threats of violence, and unjustified arrests or prosecutions of \njournalists, censorship, and the existence of criminal libel laws; corruption; and unlawful \nrecruitment or use of child soldiers by terrorists and groups in rebellion against the \ngovernment. \nConcerns about police impunity increased significantly following the sharp \nincrease in killings by police in 2016. Significant concerns also persisted about impunity \nfor the security forces, civilian national and local government officials, and powerful \nbusiness and commercial figures. Slow judicial processes remained an obstacle to \nbringing government officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses to justice. \n \nes, \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The standard that must be \nmet is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that granting the person access to classified information is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security. \n7 \n\n \n                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, the administrative \njudge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. The concept recognizes that we should \nview a person by the totality of his or her acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. (Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including those in the DOD CAF \ncase file, those submitted by Applicant, and his testimony, and the testimony of others, \nas well as an assessment of Applicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility, and after application \nof all appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the \nallegations set forth in the SOR: \n8 \n\n \n                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n7: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \nThree of Applicant\u2019s four brothers, two of her three sisters, her two children, her \nboyfriend, and her four friends from high school are all citizen-residents of the Philippines. \nOne brother is a Canadian citizen-resident, and one sister is a Philippine citizen working \nin Hong Kong. Her frequent contacts with some of them (as well as her not-so-frequent \ncontacts with some of them) are manifestations of her care and concern for relatives and \nclose friends residing in the Philippines. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an Applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \n9 \n\n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nDecember 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her siblings, children, and close friends, including her \nboyfriend, as well as her financial interests, are the current concerns for the Government. \nHowever, the security significance of these identified concerns requires further \nexamination of those relationships and financial interests to determine the degree of \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an Applicant\u2019s relatives \nand close friends in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors, \nincluding the totality of an Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the realistic \npotential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the \nforeign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the \ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country. Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is \nlimited to countries that are hostile to the United States. In fact, we must avoid reliance \non overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when \nadjudicating cases under Guideline B. \nThe nature of the foreign government involved and the intelligence-gathering \nhistory of that government are among the important considerations that provide context \nfor the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another important \nconsideration. Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood \nthat an Applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government \ncoercion or inducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of the \nPhilippines with the United States, the situation in the Philippines, including crime and \nterrorism, place a burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her relationships \nwith any family member or close friend living in the Philippines does not pose a security \nrisk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where she might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist relatives or close friends living \nin the Philippines. \nThere are terrorist groups active in the Philippines; increased levels of terrorism, \nviolence, and insurgency; and human rights problems in the Philippines that demonstrate \nthat a heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present due to Applicant\u2019s \nties to her family and close friends. However, that risk is not generated by the Philippine \ngovernment, but by terrorists striking out against the central Philippine authorities and all \nforeigners. Applicant\u2019s family members and close friends residing in the Philippines are \npotential targets in this war on civilized humanity. The presence of terrorist groups and \n10 \n\n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nincreased levels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency in the Philippines have also been \ndescribed for events occurring on September 11, 2001, and more recently in Fort Hood, \nBoston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, San Bernardino, and New York City. However, as noted \nabove, based on their relationships, there is a potential, but greatly reduced, \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify \nApplicant from holding a security clearance. \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in the Philippines seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or her family members or close friends, nevertheless, it is not prudent \nto rule out such a possibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to \nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and \nthe Philippines has a significant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and close friends in the Philippines could be a means through which Applicant \ncomes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \npotentially attempt to exert coercion upon her. \nI am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and \nundivided, and that, after being employed directly and indirectly by the U.S. Government \nin overseas assignments for many years, as well as being the widow of a long-term former \nU.S. Government employee, she has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S., that she can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest. Americans, whether in uniform or under cover, in potential \ncombat zones or areas where armies or terrorists roam freely, are not considered \npotential security risks. In this instance, the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict \nof interest is dramatically reduced to nearly zero. Nevertheless, because of the evidence \nrelated to her family and close friends in the Philippines, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been \nestablished. Further inquiry is appropriate to determine potential application of any \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists some conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such \nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  \n11 \n\n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs indicated above, three of Applicant\u2019s four brothers, two of her three sisters, her \ntwo children, her boyfriend, and two of her close friends from high school are all citizen-\nresidents of the Philippines. She is not close to one brother, the biological father of her \ntwo children, or two of her four high school friends. She periodically but rarely speaks with \nher one sister who is a Philippine citizen working in Hong Kong. Her primary method of \ncommunication remains telephone or text, except on the infrequent occasions when she \nreturns to the Philippines to visit family and her boyfriend. Her frequent contacts with \nsome of them reflect her care and concern for those relatives and close friends residing \nin the Philippines. \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or more frequently \nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent.) Frequency of contact is not the sole determinant of foreign interest security \nconcerns based on connections to family. \u201c[I]nfrequency of contact is not necessarily \nenough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his \nor her own immediate family as well as his or her spouse\u2019s immediate family.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). It is clear that Applicant cares for her family \nsimply by providing some of them places to reside or by paying her son\u2019s tuition. \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d She has significant connections to the United \nStates. Her late husband was a native-born United States citizen, serving with the U.S. \nGovernment in overseas locations. She too has been a U.S. direct or indirect employee \nin both overseas and domestic locations for many years, and she has been a naturalized \nU.S. citizen for nearly two and one-half decades.  Her siblings, children, her boyfriend, \nand two very close friends are Philippine citizen-residents. She intends to continue to \nwork in the United States. Her future intentions are either to have her boyfriend move \nhere or she will eventually retire and permanently reside in the Philippines.  \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 relationship with and historical \ninvestment in the Philippines. The Philippines is a U.S. ally in combatting terrorism after \n9/11. The Philippines and the United States are allies with the goal of maintaining the \nPhilippines territory and freedom of the seas. Applicant\u2019s relationship with the United \nStates must be weighed against the potential conflict of interest created by her \nrelationships with her family and friends who remain Philippine citizen-residents. True, \nthey are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of the Philippines \ngovernment. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information could theoretically add risk to \nthose loved-ones living in the Philippines. Applicant\u2019s connections to her relatives and \nfriends who are living in the Philippines is significant, but her history and dedication to the \nUnited States is also significant. Likewise, the positions and activities of those persons in \nthe Philippines are such that it is unlikely that the family members or good friends will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and \n8(b) have been established and they fully mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nunder Guideline B. \n12 \n\n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966)) \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s foreign influence. A variety \nof terrorist groups operate in the Philippines. For more than a decade, terrorists, \ninsurgents, and criminal actors have carried out major attacks against civilians. In 2019, \nthe Philippines made the list of the top 10 countries with the most terrorist incidents and \nthe most terrorist casualties. There were 351 incidents in the Philippines, with 1,192 \ncasualties - 3 percent of the global total of casualties. The State Department reported \nthat there are significant human rights issues in the Philippines including unlawful or \narbitrary killings; reports of forced; torture; arbitrary; harsh and life-threatening prison \nconditions; arbitrary and unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with the \nindependence of the judiciary; as well as the worst forms of restrictions on free expression \nand the press. It is in that environment that Applicant\u2019s family and close friends reside. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 53-year-old Philippine-born naturalized U.S. citizen. She \nbecame a U.S. citizen in August 1995 and relinquished her Philippine citizenship. She \nis a 1986 high school graduate with some college credits but no degree. From 1994 \nuntil 1998, she resided with her husband \u2013 a native-born U.S. citizen then employed by \nthe U.S. Government \u2013 in Singapore, where she also worked in an unspecified position \nwith the U.S. Air Force. She has been employed as a payroll support analyst by a \ngovernment contractor and initially assigned to a U.S. Government facility in the \nPhilippines from December 1998 until late in 2019. In early 2020, her position moved to \nthe United States, and she has served in identical positions for the U.S. Government \nhandling the portfolios first for Afghanistan and then for Iraq. She was married in 1991 \nand widowed in 2014. She has two adopted adult children. \n13 \n\n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ne \n \n \n \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without any questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from her \nforeign influence issues. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nForeign Influenc\nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.   \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 9, 2020. \nOn April 5, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 4, 2022, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on August 11, 2022. The Government amended SOR \u00b6 1.a to allege failure to file \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis return for tax year 2016, based on his 2022 bankruptcy filing. (FORM Item 7 at 72.) \nThe Government also amended SOR \u00b6 1.b, based on his 2022 bankruptcy filing, to reflect \na delinquent tax amount totaling approximately $56,121, for tax years 2016 through 2021. \n(FORM Item 7 at 72.) On August 11, 2022, a complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the \nFORM on August 30, 2022, but did not respond. The SOR and the answer (FORM Items \n1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. FORM Items 3 through 10, and Applicant\u2019s Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) Record of Account, dated July 12, 2022, hereafter referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit 1 (AE1), are admitted into evidence without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on November 22, 2022. \nEvidentiary Issue \nFORM Item 4 is a summary of an enhanced subject interview (ESI) initially \nconducted on October 29, 2020, with a brief follow-up interview on November 10, 2020. \nThe ESI summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department \nCounsel informed Applicant the ESI was being provided to the Administrative Judge for \nconsideration as part of the record evidence in this case, and he was entitled to comment \non the accuracy of the ESI; make any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates \nnecessary to make the summary clear and accurate; object on the ground that the report \nis unauthenticated. I conclude that Applicant waived any objections to the ESI summary \nby failing to respond to Government\u2019s notice in the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants \nare not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable \nsteps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12010810 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-f, and did not admit or \ndeny SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-h, which were added by the Government in the FORM. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-h \nwill be treated as if he denied the allegations.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nApplicant did not file his federal income tax return in tax period 2016. His 2022 \nbankruptcy filing establishes his federal and state tax delinquencies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b and 1.g. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the consumer debts. He indicated\nwithout documentation that he had started repayment on SOR \u00b6 1.d. His explanation\n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerning the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and e-f, demonstrates inaction on his part. \nHis ongoing bankruptcy and three previous bankruptcies are indicators of a person who \nis financially irresponsible. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nfederal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \nThe following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Some of the debts alleged in the SOR arguably \nresulted from circumstances beyond Applicant's control due to COVID, but his firing is a \nmatter under his control. Even though his debts may have occurred due to circumstances \nbeyond his control, he did not provide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances to resolve them. He failed to provide documented proof that he was \naddressing his debts after he returned to full-time employment status. There is no \n\u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of actual debt reduction through voluntary payment of debts, \nand implicitly where applicable, the timely resolution of federal and state tax debts. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Financial counseling is a prerequisite for a \nbankruptcy petition, but Applicant's financial situation is not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has not yet established a track record of \nadhering to a Chapter 13 payment plan. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established for the four debts in collection. No evidence of a basis \nfor disputing the debts has been provided. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Aside from action on his 2019 taxes, Applicant has \nfailed to show he has arranged with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount \nowed, and that he is in compliance with those arrangements. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \n6 \n\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nCharles C. Hale \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The monthly \npayments were $309, and he was unable to make payments after he was discharged \nfrom the Navy. The vehicle was involuntarily repossessed. According to his 2020 credit \nbureau report (CBR), the outstanding balance on the loan was $10,398, as alleged in the \nSOR.

He \ntold the government investigator in January 2019, that his intent was to repay this debt \nand he was working to repay it. At hearing, he admitted that he does not know what his \nintent is regarding this debt. Initially, he was planning to wait for the seven-year statute of \nlimitations to expire.

In 2016, Applicant was convicted at a court martial of attempts, \nconspiracy, and soliciting another to commit an offense for his role in a bank fraud \nscheme. He was sentenced to 30 days in the brig. He admitted this allegation. \nApplicant told the government investigator during his January 2019 interview, \nwhich he later adopted, without changes, that he received a Facebook message from a \nman that he did not know. The man told Applicant that he did credit card fraud. Applicant \nresponded that he was straight; however, Applicant was from City X; therefore, \u201che knew \nwhat the deal was.\u201d Applicant told two of his Navy friends about the offer, and they were \ninterested. He then recontacted the man from Facebook and told him that his friends were \ninterested. When Applicant went home to City X, he gave the Facebook man his friends\u2019 \ndebit cards, and that was the extent of his involvement. A couple of days later, Applicant\u2019s \ndebit card stopped working. When he called his bank, he was transferred to the fraud \ndepartment, and he learned that he was involved with his friends\u2019 cards being involved in \na fraud case. (GE 3 at 6) \nAt a May 2019 follow-up interview with a government investigator, Applicant told \nthe investigator that the man from Facebook was someone he knew from high school. He \nalso disclosed that he was aware that the individuals above were going to commit bank \nfraud, he also indicated that he took cards belonging to six individuals to City X to give to \nhis high school friend. (GE 3 at 14) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he wrote, \u201cSomeone from high school\u2026reached out to me. \nHe told us that he generates check and that he could name some in our name to deposit \nthem. [B]ack then, neither of us had no clue what we were in for.\u201d \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that during his first year in the Navy, a friend from \nhigh school contacted him and told him that he could generate checks for Applicant to \ndeposit into Applicant\u2019s bank account. Applicant told his friends about it, and they decided \nto do it with him.

In May 2018, Applicant was terminated from his employment for time-\ncard fraud. At that time, he was working for a defense contractor. He was initially hired as \na data management specialist (DMS), but in August 2017, he started filling in for the FSO \nwho was on maternity leave. At that time, he was interested in obtaining a full-time FSO \nposition. He told the government investigator during his January 2019 interview that he \nwas fired for timesheet issues and attendance. He was logging more hours than he was \nactually working in May 2018. He told the investigator that an example of this behavior \nwas that he would schedule an email to be sent to his manager two hours before leaving, \nbecause he did not feel like walking back upstairs to his desk, but he disputed showing \nup late for work. (GE 3 at 5) \nIn May 2019, Applicant was re-interviewed by a government investigator regarding \nthe reasons for his termination in May 2018. The investigator confronted Applicant \nmultiple times with developed information from the investigation regarding the issue of his \ntime sheets. He admitted to the investigator that his behavior of not reporting his time \naccurately was intentional. (GE 3 at 13-14) \nApplicant testified that he started showing up late to work and leaving early, as he \nwas attending night classes. As a result, his then-employer gave him a verbal warning. \nAccording to him, he was told that he was not supposed to be logging his hours as both \nthe DMS and FSO, but he was not aware of this requirement and made an \u201chonest \nmistake.\u201d (Answer; GE 3 at 5, 13; GE 7; Tr. 28-31, 48-49, 77-78) \nApplicant\u2019s former employer reported in a Defense Information System for Security \n(DSS) report that Applicant had, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeen sending false emails to his manager stating he was at work when he \nwas not.

He is described as having a \nstrong work ethic and performing his duties well. According to his current employer, he \nhas fully disclosed his past misconduct and regrets his prior poor decisions. \u201c[Applicant] \nis capable of handling and managing any situation with thoughtfulness and maturity to \nachieve the right decision.\u201d (AE D; AE I; Tr. 35) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and his 2016 conviction \nestablishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other international financial breaches of \ntrust. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest in 2008 is mitigated by the passage of time. Additionally, the \nunderlying financial concerns raised by the 2013 behavior alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is \nmitigated by the passage of time. However, his failure to be forthright regarding this \nincident throughout the adjudication of his clearance is a separate concern that I will \naddress below under Guideline E. \nApplicant has approximately $20,000 in delinquent debt. He experienced several \nperiods of unemployment, but two of these periods were due to his own misconduct. He \nalso has been going through a divorce, which has cost him at least $3,500 in attorney\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfees. However, he has no child support or alimony obligations impacting his ability to \nrepay his debts. He sought credit counseling approximately one week before the hearing, \nand at the time of the hearing, did not have the financial resources to follow the budget \ncreated by the service. He has failed to demonstrate that there are clear indications his \nfinancial problems are being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c do not appear on his most recent CBR; however, Applicant \nhas not provided corroborating documentation to show debt resolution. The record is \nabsent of any evidence of his efforts to resolve his debts or prove that the outstanding \ndebts are not his responsibility. Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence that he has \nacted responsibly to resolve his financial issues. He settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nfor less than half of the alleged amount. However, he resolved this debt following the \nhearing; therefore, he receives only partial mitigating credit, as his actions do not reflect \na timely and good-faith effort to repay or resolve his debts. Additionally, he has indicated \nthat he is unsure if he will repay the remaining alleged debts. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve his debts indicates his financial issues are an ongoing \nand continuing concern. Therefore, his behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. For the forgoing reasons, Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that raises a security concern and is \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or \nresources. \nApplicant engaged in deceptive behavior while holding a security clearance. This \nbehavior occurred when he served on active duty in the Navy and while he was working \nas a FSO for a DOD contractor. As a result of his conduct, he was convicted of a crime \nand ultimately discharged from the Navy with a less than honorable discharge in 2016. \nTwo years later, he was terminated by his employer for time-card fraud. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Four of those conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAt the hearing, Applicant minimized his culpability for his behavior related to the \n2013 bank-fraud scheme and his 2018 firing for time-card fraud. He provided a version of \nevents for both incidents in his January 2019 interview with a government investigator. In \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 2019, he was re-interviewed and confronted with additional facts and his version \nof events changed for both incidents. He later adopted these statements with no changes. \nIn his Answer and at the hearing, Applicant minimized his culpability and \nknowledge regarding the bank-fraud scheme, leading me to question his veracity. He also \nminimized his behavior leading up to his 2018 firing. All of this is indicative of an individual \nwho has not taken positive steps to change his behavior or demonstrate the behavior is \nunlikely to recur. Based upon his inability to be forthright, I have ongoing doubt regarding \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Mitigation was not established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s \nletters of recommendation, his credit counseling, and other documentary evidence. Based \nupon his testimony, and his inconsistent statements to investigators in 2019, he continues \nto behave in ways that demonstrate a lack of trustworthiness and reliability. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns at issue. Accordingly, he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n11\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.d \nAgainst Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.e \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent to continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for access to classified information.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is working on a \nmaster\u2019s degree. He was married from 2004 to 2014. He has two children from the \nmarriage, ages 24 and 15.

He has owned his own home since \n2020. (Tr. 30-32, 49-50 \nApplicant began his military service with the Army National Guard in 2004 and \ntransferred to the regular Army where he served until he was honorably discharged in \nMarch 2012. He was involved in combat operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom from \nOctober 2009 to October 2010. He is authorized to wear the Army Commendation Medal, \nArmy Achievement Medal, Meritorious Unit Commendation, Army Good Conduct Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service \nRibbon, and the Overseas Service Ribbon. (Tr. 32-35, 55-56; GE 1; AE E) \nIn 2012, while still in the Army, Applicant was diagnosed with post traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD). He was experiencing depression and suicidal ideations due to his \ncombat experiences and a struggling marriage. He had been trained to seek help and \nguidance from his chain of command if he needed it or felt suicidal. He sought help and \nwas referred to the mental health clinic at the military hospital. He self-admitted for in\u00ad\npatient mental health care. He was there a few days and was released with instructions \non how to cope with his negative feelings from combat operations which resulted in PTSD. \nHe was attending both group and individual therapy through Veterans Affairs (VA) through \n2016. (SOR 1.a). (Tr. 35-37, 56, 75-77) \nIn 2016, Applicant was struggling again with depression and suicidal ideations after \nhis divorce, toxic romantic relationships, and multiple periods of unemployment. He \nacknowledged that during this time he had an altercation with his former girlfriend who \nwas unfaithful. He was arrested and charged with battery and destruction of property. His \ncase was adjudicated in the state\u2019s veteran court. He completed all the terms and \nrequirements imposed and the charges were dismissed. (Tr. 39-41, 57, 60, 78-82) \nDuring that time, Applicant self-reported that he was struggling and voluntarily \nadmitted himself for inpatient treatment. He participated in counseling and therapy.

At the time of the incident with his girlfriend, the medication he was \nprescribed was not helping his PTSD. After inpatient treatment, he was prescribed a new \nmedication, which is effective, and he continues to take it. (Tr. 36-39, 60-61) \nIn October 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a government-approved licensed \npsychologist (LP) during a virtual telemedicine appointment. Based on background \ninformation, clinical interview, observations, and a psychological test, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with PTSD. LP reported in her evaluation and findings for his mental status \nand behavioral observations that he had good insight and appeared open and honest in \nhis report. She also noted that his psychological test results suggested a degree of \ndefensiveness in his responses. She said, \u201cGiven this positive impressive management, \nthe information garnered upon interview and his test results may be an inaccurate \nrepresentation of the applicant\u2019s current mental health status, likely underestimating \nconcerns.\u201d (GE 2) \nLP had Applicant complete a personality assessment inventory (PAI). She noted \nproblem areas that could merit further inquiry, such as a high level of defensiveness, \nwhich could likely reflect significant distortion, and minimization of difficulties in certain \nareas. She opined that regardless of the cause, the PAI results are unlikely to be a valid \nreflection of his current experience and mental health status. She said that all clinical \nscales fell within the normal limits, with no elevations suggesting a psychological disorder. \n(GE 2) \nLP noted that Applicant appeared to have a generally stable and positive self-\nevaluation, which are valuable characteristics because they allow him to be resilient and \nadaptive in the face of most stressors. Further she stated that Applicant\u2019s social \nenvironment, with respect to perceived stressor and the availability of social support with \nwhich to deal the stressors, and his responses indicated that both his recent level of stress \nand his perceived level of social support are about average in comparison to normal \nadults. She opined, \u201cThe reasonably low stress environment and the intact social support \nsystem are both favorable prognostic signs for future adjustment.\u201d (GE 2) \nLP said that Applicant\u2019s reported mood swings that ranged from \u201cfine\u201d to \n\u201cdepressed\u201d had significantly improved. He was compliant with his medication and did not \nhave recent suicidal ideations. She said: \nHe does appear to have good insight into his symptoms and overall mental \nhealth status, seeking treatment when needed and advocating for his own \nmental health. In addition, the legal concerns. . . have been resolved and \nhe is actually now volunteering with the veterans\u2019 treatment court. (GE 2) \nLP\u2019s concerns were due to Applicant\u2019s psychological testing being rendered invalid \ndue to indications of defensiveness/positive impression management. She said that \nApplicant\u2019s scores showed problems of greater intensity that those of typical defensive \nrespondents. The problems areas were moodiness, poor control over anger, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunsupportive family and friends. Because of this defensive psychological profile, she \nopined that \u201cthere were apparent limitations to [Applicant\u2019s] reliability, stability and good \njudgment.\u201d She concluded, \u201cTherefore, although his mental health status is presently \nstable and he appeared to be forthright and honest in his interview, his prognosis is \nconsidered guarded.\u201d (GE 2) \nIn September 2021, Applicant sought another opinion regarding his mental health \nstatus. He was seen by a psychiatrist. Applicant said he told the psychiatrist his whole \nhistory, his treatment, including medications he has taken. He testified the psychiatrist \nsaid his current treatment was effective. He provided an assessment report from the \npsychiatrist diagnosing him with PTSD, chronic; other long term (current) drug therapy; \nand other psychosocial and environmental problems. The psychiatrist opined: \u201cWe don\u2019t \nsee any reason today that the patient should not maintain his security clearance.\u201d (Tr. 42, \n66; AE A) \nIn January 2023, Applicant sought a more recent mental health evaluation, and it \nwas conduct by a licensed psychologist, Dr. F. He used data from clinical and collateral \ninterviews; general and behavioral observations; checklist of adaptive living skills; mental \nstatus examination; mini-mental state examination; Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of \nIntelligence; wide range achievement test; Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test; SPECTRA \nIndices of Psychopathology; and Combat Exposure Scale. (Tr. 67-68; AE J) \nApplicant provided Dr. F with a history of his background consistent with what was \nprovided to LP and the psychiatrist. Applicant testified that he discussed with DR. F his \nprevious diagnoses. Numerous psychological tests were administered, and he was \ninterviewed. Dr. F\u2019s conclusions were that Applicant did not have any learning disorders \nwhich could impact the tests. There were no indications that Applicant experiences \nsignificant neuropsychological impairment. He did score \u201cmoderate-to-heavy\u201d exposure \nto combat fire, consistent with notable PTSD symptoms. His responses on a \ncomprehensive, standardized inventory of adult psychopathology \u201csuggested significant \nhigh levels of PTSD symptoms, moderate anxiety, and notable grandiose ideation \nsuggestive of high self-esteem and confidence.\u201d There was no evidence of significant \ndepression, alcohol or drug use, aggression, paranoia, psychosis, anti-social tendencies, \nobsessions or compulsions, mania, cognitive dysfunction, psychosocial impairment, or \nsuicidal ideation. Dr. F opined: \u201cEvaluative findings suggest [Applicant] can learn, execute \nand perform duties within his scope of comprehension without reservation or difficulty.\u201d \n(Tr. 47-49; AE J) \nApplicant disclosed both mental health incidents and his arrest on his July 2017 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA). He credibly testified that he has been treated for \nPTSD since his military discharge. Through his treatment, he has learned valuable coping \nskills and is cognizant of emotional triggers that may affect his judgment or mental well\u00ad\nbeing. He remains on medication and is compliant. He sees his doctor annually to be \nevaluated for his medication regime and mental health status updates. He has learned \ncoping skills and has hobbies that help him. He is aware of options if he feels the need to \nseek help, such as the Veterans\u2019 Affairs hotline, members of his family, his ex-wife with \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhom he remains close, and other veterans\u2019 services.

(Tr. 58-63) \nApplicant is involved in mentoring others who suffer with PTSD at the Veterans\u2019 \nTreatment Center. He has a background in art, so he volunteers as a teacher in art \ntherapy. He teaches different mediums that help with coping skills. (Tr. 61, 70-72) \nApplicant testified that in his current position, he has served as the custodian for \nclassified hard drives. His office is transitioning to digital. It is evolving technology and he \nhad to obtain multiple certifications to be compliant. (Tr. 53-54) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor, who is now retired, testified on his behalf. He is the \nperson who hired Applicant in 2017. He observed him daily for five years. He stated that \nApplicant is conscientious, and when he sees a problem, he fixes it without being told to \ndo so. He is service-oriented and can be trusted to get the job done without oversight \nfrom supervisors. He is excellent with dealing customers. He was responsible for \nmanaging 800-900 classified hard drives. He is responsible for knowing where each hard \ndrive is located in their physical spaces at all times. His work is independently audited to \nensure the classified hard drives are being properly managed and secured. It is a tedious \nand thankless responsibility, and he was hand-picked for it because he understood the \nseriousness of the responsibility. The witness personally selected Applicant for this \nresponsibility as a replacement for himself. It is the most important job in the company \nbecause failure to comply with the rules could shut the site down. It is a high-risk \nresponsibility, and Applicant has completed it flawlessly. (Tr. 16-29) \nThe witness stated that Applicant told him about his mental health issues and has \nbeen completely honest with him. He was confident that Applicant would report any issues \nthat he was experiencing, which he thought would impact the job. The witness has no \nhesitation at all about Applicant continuing to hold a security clearance and have access \nto classified information. He exercises sound judgment and can handle any of the \ntechnical or rules pertaining to classified information. He has not been involved in any \nsecurity violations, behavioral issues, or performance concerns. He is reliable, \ntrustworthy, and exercises good judgment. Applicant took over the hard drive \naccountability job about four to five months before the witness retired in late 2021 and \nhas had sole responsibility for it since then. (Tr. 16-29) \nApplicant provided character letters from friends, coworkers, and family. They \nstated that Applicant is trustworthy, loyal, dedicated, professional, responsible, valuable, \ndiligent, and a patriot. His ex-wife who has known him for 28 years stated he is a hard-\nworker, goal-oriented, and positive role model for their children.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nApplicant experienced suicidal ideations in 2012 and 2016 and voluntarily admitted \nhimself for in-patient treatment and was diagnosed with depression. In October 2020, LP, \na qualified mental health professional, diagnosed Applicant with PTSD and opined there \nwere apparent limitations to his reliability, stability, and good judgment. She concluded \nthat, although his mental health status is presently stable and he appeared to be forthright \nand honest in his interview, his prognosis is considered guarded. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nIn 2012 and 2016, Applicant recognized he had mental health issues, sought \ntreatment, and has remained compliant with all medical recommendations. He has \nincorporated into his life the coping mechanisms he learned and has been consistently \ncompliant with all prescribed medications. When he needs emotional help, he obtains it. \nHe went through treatment and counseling, and now serves as a mentor and volunteers \nhis expertise in art to help others with PTSD. I have considered all three mental health \nevaluations. The opinion and guarded prognosis by LP, the government psychologist, \nwas more than two years ago. I find the two more recent prognoses from 2021 and 2023, \nto be more relevant and probative. I find that Applicant\u2019s condition is controllable and is \nbeing treated. He is also compliant with all medical recommendations. AG \u00b6 29(a) applies. \nThe two most recent opinions were by qualified mental health professionals, but they were \nnot employed by the government. AG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply due to that fact, but I have \ngiven considerable weight to their reports. \nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself into the hospital in 2012 and 2016. He has \nsince participated in counseling and continues to see his doctor annually to be evaluated \nfor his medication regime and mental health status updates. In 2021 and 2023, he \nreceived favorable prognoses by duly qualified mental health professionals. AG \u00b6 29(b) \napplies. His PTSD is not temporary. AG \u00b6 29(d) does not apply. Applicant has not \nexperienced any mental health issues since 2016, and there is no indication of a current \nproblem. AG \u00b6 29(e) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline I in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is committed to maintaining his mental health stability, as evidenced by \nhis self-referral in the past and his current compliance with his doctor\u2019s prescribed \nmedications and recommendations. He has met his burden of persuasion. The record \nevidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline I, psychological conditions. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

He made multiple false statements about his history \nduring the security clearance process. The security concerns over his conduct and \npsychological conditions are ongoing and unmitigated. He did not provide sufficient \ninformation to mitigate the alleged security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \ninvolvement), Guideline H (drug involvement), Guideline I (psychological conditions), or \nGuideline E (personal conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 6, 2018. On \nMarch 31, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines G, H, I and E. The CAF issued the SOR under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n1 \n\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 8, 2022, and elected a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). (Tr. \n9-10) The case was assigned to me on February 16, 2023. On March 17, 2023, \nfollowing consultation with the parties, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for \nApril 13, 2023, by video teleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Applicant represented himself during the \nhearing. During preliminary procedural matters, he indicated that he had read the \u201cPre-\nhearing Guidance Memo\u201d issued by the DOHA Chief Judge, a memo that he received\nalong with the hearing notice. The memo details his rights and responsibilities in the\nDOHA hearing process, including the right to legal counsel. Applicant knowingly elected\nto proceed pro se. (Tr. 5-7) \n \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits 1 \nthrough 9, all of which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel also \nrequested that I take administrative notice of certain relevant excerpts from the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) \n(Administrative Notice (AN) I), and I have done so. (Tr. 23-25) \nApplicant testified but did not submit any exhibits during his case. At the end of \nthe hearing, I held the record open, initially until May 1, 2023, to allow him the \nopportunity to submit post-hearing evidence. \nAt the close of the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew the cross-allegation at \nSOR \u00b6 4.d. (Tr. 126-129)) \nOn April 25, 2023, Applicant indicated that he had consulted legal counsel to \nassist him in post-hearing matters. He requested and received additional time to submit \npost-hearing exhibits. Without objection, I extended the post-hearing deadline until May \n15, 2023. Applicant expressed his understanding that the hearing would not be \nreconvened. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) III) \nOn May 2, 2023, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered appearance in the case. (HE IV) He \nsubsequently submitted documents that are marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough AE E and admitted without objection. AE A is the entry of appearance. AE B is \na transcript except from this case. AE C is a post-hearing declaration from Applicant. AE \nD is comprised of three statements from character witnesses. AE E is a Statement of \nIntent. Applicant\u2019s counsel also submitted a post-hearing brief dated May 19, 2023, and \nvarious DOHA case excerpts. Department Counsel submitted comments in response, \nby e-mail on May 23, 2023. (HE V and VI). The record closed on May 23, 2023. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 1, 2023. \n2 \n\n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, mostly with \nexplanations. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, 3.b, and 4.a-4.c, without comment. He \ndid not answer the cross-allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 4.d. I construe those answers \nas denials. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He has never married and he has no children. He \nearned a high school diploma in 2012 and has taken some college courses. He has \nbeen employed by a federal contractor as an information technology (IT) specialist since \nAugust 2014. He testified that he has held a secret or interim secret clearance since \n2014, though he asserted that he did not have actual access to classified information. \nHe has held his current position as an IT team lead since May 2019. He has an annual \nsalary of about $96,000. He works on a military base. (GE 1; Tr. 12, 27-32, 61-65, 105) \nIn March 2013, Dr. S diagnosed Applicant with major depressive disorder and \natypical depressive disorder. Dr. S\u2019s notes indicate that Applicant \u201chas clinical \ndepression; has not been on meds for several months, having anxiety attacks, sleep \ndeprivation.\u201d He was brought for medical attention by his mother. (GE 9) He did not \nseek medical approval before ceasing his medication at the time. (Tr. 68-70) \nGE 8 is comprised of treatment records for Applicant from Dr. M and Dr. J from \nSeptember 2013 to January 2019. Applicant was diagnosed with generalized anxiety \ndisorder and atypical depressive disorder. He acknowledged experiencing symptoms of \ndepression and anxiety since age 12. (Tr. 65-67, 71-78, 80-81) \nOn or about September 27, 2017, Applicant then age 23, went to the emergency \nroom (ER) of Hospital C complaining of depression and anxiety. He reported drinking \nalcohol and using cocaine as coping mechanisms, and that he had consumed a fifth of \nalcohol and used cocaine the night before. He reported intermittent thoughts of suicide \n(though not at that time) but has never had a plan. (GE 5 at 1-2; Tr. 83-85) He was \nadmitted to the hospital due to \u201csuicidal ideation\u201d (i.e., thoughts of suicide). (GE 2 at 13) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nAt Hospital C, Applicant was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent, moderate. (GE 2 at 15) He was discharged from Hospital C on October 2, \n2017 and referred to Treatment Center P for inpatient substance abuse treatment. (GE \n2 at 15; Tr. 83-85) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 3.a) He was diagnosed at Treatment Center P with \nalcohol use disorder, severe; cocaine use disorder, severe; cannabis use disorder, \nsevere, tobacco use disorder, mild; and major depressive disorder. (GE 6 at 2) \nTreatment Center P records reflect that Applicant reported first using alcohol at \n17. He was found to be severely dependent on alcohol, with daily reported use over the \nprevious three years. He reported drinking a fifth of alcohol 20 of the previous 30 days, \nand using cocaine five of the previous 30 days, before his ER admission. He began \n3 \n\nusing marijuana at age 16 and used it for four years regularly. (GE 6 at 2; Tr. 79, 86-87) \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b) During his testimony, Applicant asserted that the frequency of his \ncocaine use, as reflected in GE 6, is inaccurate as he only recalled or acknowledged \nusing cocaine twice. (Tr. 86-87) He denied marijuana use within 30 days of entering \ntreatment. (Tr. 88; GE 6 at 2) \nApplicant did not complete inpatient treatment at Treatment Center P. He left \nabruptly on October 14, 2017, reportedly because he did not want to be there anymore. \nHis prognosis was poor due to his inability to successfully complete treatment. It was \nnoted that he would benefit from readmission to residential treatment and involvement \nin a 12-step program. (GE 6 at 3; Tr. 89) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) It was recommended that \nApplicant continue to abstain from alcohol and drugs; that he consider outpatient \npsychiatric treatment and behavioral counseling; attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) or other meetings daily; and submit to random urinalysis \nand breath analysis as directed. (GE 6 at 1) Applicant acknowledged that he has not \ndone any of these things. (Tr. 90) \nIn December 2017, Applicant went to the ER at Hospital C due to insomnia and \nacute anxiety after running out of his medication, Wellbutrin. He was not admitted. (GE \n2 at 3. GE 7; Tr. 95-97) (SOR \u00b6 3.b) Afterwards, his mother wrote a letter to his primary \ncare physician, Dr. J, about Applicant\u2019s anxiety. (GE 8 at 8-9; Tr. 97) \nApplicant reported on his SCA that he had been treated for depression at \nHospital C in about September 2017 and needed to get on the right medication. (GE 1 \nat 24-25; Tr. 83) He reported being treated for alcohol use at Treatment Center P from \nSeptember to October 2017. (GE 1 at 27-28) He did not report any illegal drug use in \nthe previous seven years; he reported no illegal drug involvement while in possession of \na clearance; and he reported no drug treatment. (GE 1 at 26-27) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a, 4.b) He \nreported on his SCA that he had been previously granted a clearance by DOD but \nprovided no details. (GE 1 at 28-29) \nApplicant had background interviews relating to his SCA in September 2018, \nMay 2019, and July 2019. In his first interview, he verified his reported hospitalization at \nHospital C and said it was for depression. He also discussed his history of alcohol use. \nHe said he had not been diagnosed as abusing alcohol or being alcohol dependent. He \ndid not disclose any other issues of substance abuse. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 90) \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2019 interview, he said he was hospitalized at Hospital C for \none week for medication maintenance after his primary care physician, Dr. J, changed \nhis anti-depression medication. He said he was not hospitalized for any other condition. \nHe discussed his substance abuse counseling at Treatment Center P, and his alcohol \ninvolvement and history at the time. He was asked if he had used illegal drugs in the \npast seven years, to include marijuana, and he said no. (GE 2 at 8-10; Tr. 83, 91-92) \n(SOR \u00b6 4.c) He acknowledged at his hearing that his time at Treatment Center P would \nbe considered drug counseling. (Tr. 92) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed a third time, in July 2019. He was confronted about his \nprior marijuana and cocaine use. He said he had used cocaine once in 2017, then said \nhe used it once or twice between June 2011 and the present. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b) (Tr. 60) \nHe denied being a habitual user of cocaine and said his cocaine use was experimental. \nHe said he used marijuana between 2008 and late 2011 about 10 times a year, with \nvarying frequency. He used it to help him sleep and to cope with depression. He said he \nhad not used marijuana since 2011 and had not used cocaine since 2017. He denied \nintentionally omitting his illegal drug use from his SCA. Earlier in the interview, he said \nhe did not list his drug use because he believed it was not on record anywhere and was \nnot a problem. (GE 2 at 10-11; Tr. 92-93) (SOR \u00b6 4.c) \nApplicant also disclosed that the real reason for his hospitalization at Hospital C \nin 2017 was for both medication maintenance and alcohol treatment. (GE 2 at 11-12) \nHe authenticated the three interview summaries as accurate in a signed but undated \ninterrogatory response. (GE 2) \nIn November 2020, Applicant participated in a psychological evaluation ordered \nby the DOD CAF related to his security clearance investigation. The evaluation was \nconducted by Dr. B, a Ph.D. licensed clinical psychologist. She reviewed medical \nrecords provided by the DOD CAF, as well as his SCA and background interview \nsummaries. She also conducted a clinical interview, testing observations, and a \npersonality assessment inventory (PAI). (GE 3 at 1-2, GE 4) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 3.c) \nApplicant told Dr. B that he had always been a \u201ccasual\u201d drinker and had never \nengaged in binge drinking. He drank more prior to his 2017 hospitalization and was \nmixing alcohol with his prescribed medications. He said he had reduced his drinking \nsignificantly since 2018, consuming a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer a week. (GE 3 \nat 4) (SOR \u00b6 1.d) He said he took Zoloft as needed and that he meets with his primary \ncare doctor every three months for refills. (GE 3 at 3, 4) \nWith respect to drug use, Applicant told Dr. B that he stopped smoking marijuana \nat age 22. He acknowledged trying cocaine on \u201ca couple of occasions in my past,\u201d and \nsaid he had only used cocaine twice in 2018. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b) He said his three-day \nhospitalization in 2017 was due to switching medications and was \u201cjust to be safe.\u201d He \ndid not disclose his 2017 substance abuse treatment at Center P or his subsequent ER \nvisit in 2017. It was noted that records from 2019 indicated that he has a history of not \nbeing fully candid about his cocaine and marijuana use during interviews and in his \ncase paperwork. (GE 3 at 4) \nDr. B found that Applicant acknowledged his history of depression and anxiety \nbut tended to minimize his symptoms. He \u201cseverely downplayed his history of alcohol, \ncocaine, and marijuana use and he was not fully candid about his struggles with \nsubstances. His lack of candor \u201cappears to be a pattern.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) \nDr. B found Applicant\u2019s lack of honesty regarding his history of substance abuse \n\u201cparticularly concerning\u201d since he failed to complete his residential treatment program in \n2017; he was given a poor prognosis by counselors; he failed to follow through on \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndischarge instructions; had not received mental health or substance abuse treatment \nsince 2017 and continued to consume alcohol at a fairly high level. Dr. B found that \nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated lack of honesty impacted the credibility of his self-reporting \nabout his prior drug use. His prognosis was \u201cguarded, at best.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) \nDr. B. diagnosed Applicant with (1) major depressive disorder (moderate, \nrecurrent) (DSM 296.32); (2) alcohol use disorder, severe (DSM 303.90); (3) cannabis \ndisorder (severe) (DSM 304.30); and (4) stimulant use disorder (severe) (DSM 304.40). \n(GE 3 at 6) (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nDr. B. found that major depressive disorder tends to be a chronic and highly \nrecurrent condition. Applicant has experienced symptoms since childhood. His tendency \nto self-medicate, coupled with ongoing alcohol use, inadequate treatment and, \u201cperhaps \nmost importantly, limited insight and transparency, point to a guarded prognosis. At this \ntime, [Applicant\u2019s] diagnoses could pose a risk to his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, because he said he never had or expressed \nthoughts of suicide. (Tr. 33-34) He denied SOR \u00b6 1.b because he said he abstained \nfrom alcohol for a year, and sought therapy, but the doctor he consulted in late 2017 did \nnot carry his insurance. (Tr. 110) He did not pursue mental health treatment or \ncounseling after that or during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not done so since then. \n(Tr. 110-111) He has consulted his primary care physician whom he has seen for many \nyears. (Tr. 110-112) He is currently prescribed propranolol (anti-anxiety) and Zoloft \n(anti-depressant). (Answer; Tr. 34-39) He said he continues to experience \u201csundown \nsyndrome\u201d (the worsening of his anxiety or depression at night). (Tr, 97-98; GE 8 at 8) \nHe denied mental health issues at work necessitating treatment. (Tr. 99) \nApplicant acknowledged that before his 2017 treatment, his drinking had \nincreased to four times a week, which he acknowledged was \u201cbinge drinking\u201d and self-\nmedication, where \u201cone day would lead to the next day.\u201d (Tr. 42) He was consuming a \nbottle of wine or a fifth of liquor per occasion. (Tr. 45-47, 78) He said it \u201ctook a while\u201d to \nrealize what he was doing. He knows now that he cannot do that. This led him to self-\nrefer, with some family assistance, to Hospital C in 2017 for treatment and \u201cso I can get \non the right medication.\u201d (Tr. 43) \nApplicant said he left Treatment Center P because of anxiety and unfamiliarity \nwith being around a lot of people. He said his departure did not relate to alcohol. He \nnow sees that he should have completed the program. He recognizes that he was at \n\u201crock-bottom\u201d at the time and does not want to feel that way again. (Tr. 44-45) \nApplicant said he resumed drinking socially after about a year of sobriety in about \n2018 or 2019 but consumed less alcohol. (Tr. 39-41) He said \u201cI knew myself enough \nthat, in a social capacity, I could be able to continue consuming alcohol.\u201d (Tr. 42) He did \nso unilaterally, \u201ccoming [to] a personal moment, trying to, you know, see how I do.\u201d (Tr. \n100) He acknowledged that this was \u201cprobably not\u201d recommended. He found it a \u201cbig \nstep\u201d that he could have one drink and then stop. (Tr. 101) Later, however, during the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \nCOVID-19 pandemic, when he was at home teleworking full time, he on occasion \nconsumed a whole bottle of wine or a 12-pack of beer at home at one sitting. \u201cEvery \nnow and then throughout 2020 I did that,\u201d he said. (Tr. 102) \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, which asserts that he engages in ongoing severe \nsubstance abuse. (Answer; Tr. 47-48) He testified that he has made an \u201cagreement\u201d \nwith himself to know his limits. He said he can go months without drinking. He continues \nto have one or two drinks on dates or social occasions. He last had a drink three weeks \nbefore the hearing, one or two drinks on a golf course, and then two months before that. \nHe said he had not been intoxicated in a year or more, when he had \u201ca couple glasses \nof mixed drinks\u201d at his brother\u2019s birthday party. (Tr. 49-51, 100) \nApplicant has never received a medical opinion that he could drink again. (Tr. \n102) Since 2018, he has sought no mental health counseling, except from Dr. J, his \nprimary care physician. He sees her every three to four months for medication refills \nand for primary care treatment. He said he has \u201cfor the most part\u201d kept to his medication \nregimen since his 2017 treatment, though he has continued drinking on days he took his \nmedication. He has not sought treatment in the ER since then. (Tr. 102-105) \nApplicant has not participated in any drug or alcohol counseling or treatment \nsince he left Treatment Center P. He has not participated in AA meetings. (Tr. 51-52, \n112-113) He said he drinks alcohol less than once a week, and no longer consumes a \nbottle of wine or a six-pack of beer at one sitting, as he did in 2020, at the time of his \nDOD evaluation by Dr. B. (Tr. 99-100) \nApplicant said he had not used marijuana since 2011 and had not used cocaine \nsince 2017. He had a clearance in 2017 when he used cocaine. He used it twice, in \nsocial situations like at a bar. He acknowledged that cocaine and marijuana are illegal \nunder federal law and inconsistent with holding a clearance. He believes he is subject to \nrandom drug testing at work. (Tr. 53-54, 88, 93-94, 105-107) \nApplicant acknowledged that Dr. B\u2019s report shows he used cocaine twice in 2018, \nnot 2017, but he thinks he may have meant 2017. (Tr. 107-108; GE 3 at 4) He also \nasserted that statements in Treatment Center P\u2019s records that he used cocaine starting \nat age 23 and used cocaine regularly for one year, including five of the past 3 days prior \nto September 26, 2017, were \u201cnot accurate.\u201d Similarly, he denied that he had used \nmarijuana for four years regularly, asserting that he had not used marijuana since high \nschool. (Tr. 108-109; GE 6 at 2) He was unable to explain why his testimony \ncontradicted Dr. B\u2019s records. (Tr. 109-110) \nAs to Guideline E, Applicant testified that he first applied for a clearance at age \n20, and he was young and did not get good advice from his company on how to fill out \nthe SCA. He asserted that he did not disclose his 2011 marijuana use on his first SCA \n(in 2014) due to naivety and because it occurred in high school, before he turned 18. He \ngraduated from high school in 2012. (Tr. 27-28, 55-59) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he did not disclose his 2017 cocaine use or his \n2011 marijuana use on his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 54) He said he held a clearance at the time, \ngranted sometime after 2014. (Tr. 57-58) He testified that he did not input any new \ninformation on his 2018 SCA. He was just told to \u201creview this and just hit Okay.\u201d (Tr. 27-\n28, 31) He did disclose his treatments at Hospital C and Treatment Center P in 2017, \nboth of which were after his first SCA. (Tr. 32) He did not intend to mislead the \ngovernment. (Tr. 32) He said he came clean because he was confronted by the \ninterviewer, who had evidence of his cocaine use in his medical records. (Tr. 56-57, 59-\n60) \nApplicant asserted that his future intention as to illegal drug use is \u201cnever to use.\u201d \nHe believes he is \u201cwell past the dependency for it and the self-medication.\u201d He will \ncontinue drinking socially but will continue working on cutting back on his drinking. (Tr. \n113-115) he said he always uses a ride-share service when he is out drinking and has \nnever had a DUI or been pulled over by the police. (Tr. 113-115) \nApplicant has worked at his DOD job for his whole career. He cannot change the \npast but can continue to work on improving himself. He has had no criminal issues or \nworkplace issues. His personal issues have never affected his work life. (Tr. 28-30) He \nclosed his testimony by stating that he has presented himself as best he can and has \ncome a long way in the last eight years. He feels blessed to be where he is today. He \nloves his job and wants to continue his career. (Tr. 116-118) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant retained counsel, and he submitted additional \nexhibits. In a post-hearing Declaration, he said he wished he had completed the \nprogram at Treatment Center P in 2017, but still learned from the experience. He \nreaffirmed that he had not used cocaine or marijuana since leaving the facility. He said \nthat since his hearing, he has attended AA meetings. He did not see himself as \u201chaving \na problem\u201d in the past but now acknowledges that \u201cany use is [too] much.\u201d He has dealt \nwith clinical depression and anxiety for most of his adult life and has taken them \nseriously. He has begun vetting therapists so he can pursue regular care and continue \nprogressing. (AE C) Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent not to use illegal \ndrugs in the future and acknowledged that any violation was grounds for automatic \nrevocation of his clearance. (AE E) \nApplicant submitted character letters from two longtime friends and from an \nexecutive with his employer. They attest that Applicant cares about his job, his family, \nhis friends, and his career. He has worked hard to improve himself. He is very \ntrustworthy personally and professionally. He is more mature and responsible than he \nwas earlier in his career. He is reliable, trustworthy, and emotionally stable. He should \nretain his clearance. (AE D) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(e), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n9 \n\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker) of \nalcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant has suffered from depression and anxiety since childhood. He has a \nlong history of drug and alcohol abuse, including as coping mechanisms and for self-\nmedication. \nIn September 2017, he went to the ER and was hospitalized due to suicidal \nideation and depression. Records indicate that he reported drinking a fifth of alcohol on \n20 of the previous 30 days and using cocaine five out of the previous 30 days. After \nseveral days of hospitalization, he was sent for inpatient substance-abuse treatment. He \nwas diagnosed with major depressive disorder, severe; alcohol use disorder, severe; \ncocaine use disorder, severe, and cannabis use disorder, severe. \nApplicant left Treatment Center P abruptly, in mid-October 2017, without \ncompleting treatment. He did not comply with the discharge recommendations that he \nabstain from alcohol (he resumed drinking after a year), did not attend counseling like \nAA or NA, and has not sought outpatient counseling or psychiatric care, other than from \nhis longtime primary care physician. He resumed social drinking in about 2018 and \nengaged in frequent binge drinking and drinking to excess during the COVID-19 \npandemic, a time when he (like many others) was working from home. \nIn November 2020, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. B, a licensed Ph.D. \npsychologist, as requested by the DOD CAF. Dr. B diagnosed him with major \ndepressive disorder, moderate, recurrent; alcohol use disorder, severe; cannabis use \ndisorder, severe; and stimulant use disorder, severe. He continues to consume alcohol \nsocially contrary to treatment recommendations that he abstain. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), 22(d), \n22(e), and 22(f) all apply. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \n10 \n\nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant has a long history of using alcohol (among other substances) as a \ncoping mechanism and a self-medication tool for his chronic depression. He has been \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. He abruptly left the inpatient treatment \nprogram in 2017 He abstained from alcohol for about a year after that but decided on \nhis own to resume social drinking. During the COVID pandemic, when he was working \nfrom home, likely with few social outlets, he resumed binge drinking. He has never \nseriously pursued any recommended aftercare counseling or treatment program, or self-\nhelp program like AA to address his issues. His assertions about his current pattern of \nself-monitored social drinking are uncorroborated and are undercut significantly by his \nestablished history of false statements and lack of candor about his substance use, not \nonly in the treatment and evaluation record, but during the security clearance process. \nApplicant noted in his post-hearing statement that he has begun AA and is in the \nbeginning stages of pursuing counseling. While this is admirable, it is far too little and \nfar too late to mitigate the security concerns about his alcohol involvement. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the trustworthiness concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n11 \n\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder; \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed \nby a duly qualified medical or mental health professional; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nIt is illegal under Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, \nincluding marijuana and cocaine. (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. \nSee \u00a7 844) Applicant used marijuana between about 2008 to \u201cat least\u201d 2011. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a) During those years, he was in high school. He used cocaine in 2017. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nAG \u00b6 25(a) applies to both allegations. \nNo other drug-related conduct or condition is alleged in the SOR under Guideline \nH. Applicant was diagnosed in 2017 and 2020 with cannabis use disorder, severe; in \n2017 with cocaine use disorder, severe; and in 2020 with stimulant use disorder, \nsevere. AG \u00b6 25(d) would apply had his diagnoses been alleged under Guideline H. \nInstead, they are addressed under Guideline I, discussed below. Nevertheless, they can \nbe considered in weighing mitigation. \nApplicant failed to complete the residential treatment program at Treatment \nCenter P and quit the program abruptly in October 2017. AG \u00b6 25(e) would also \notherwise have been applicable here, but it was not alleged under Guideline H. \nNevertheless, that fact can be considered in weighing mitigation. \nApplicant testified that he held a clearance in 2017 when he used cocaine. It is \nnot established that he had access to classified information, though he likely held a \nsensitive position at the time. However, his cleared status at the time was not alleged, \nso AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26, including the \nfollowing: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \n12 \n\nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national trustworthiness eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana and cocaine is likely more extensive than alleged. \nHe told Dr. B that he used marijuana until he was 22 (well after high school). Medical \nrecords indicate that he used cocaine on several occasions in 2017, not just the two \ninstances in 2017 he acknowledged in his hearing, and also that he used marijuana \nregularly over a four-year period. Applicant\u2019s established instances of marijuana use \nand cocaine use are themselves rather dated. However, they also led to diagnoses of \ncannabis use disorder, severe (2017 and 2020); cocaine use disorder, severe (2017); \nand stimulant use disorder, severe (2020). Further, Applicant quit the substance \ntreatment program in October 2017 and has not seriously pursued treatment or \ncounseling since. Any mitigating effect of his purported abstinence is also severely \nundercut by Applicant\u2019s established lack of candor and false statements about his drug \nuse, in the evaluative record and during the security clearance process. No disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set forth in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n13 \n\n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nIn 2017, Applicant was admitted for inpatient treatment at Hospital C and \nTreatment Center P and diagnosed with major depressive disorder, severe; alcohol use \ndisorder, severe; cocaine use disorder, severe, and cannabis use disorder, severe. \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a) In 2020, a licensed psychologist diagnosed Applicant with major \ndepressive disorder, moderate, recurrent; alcohol use disorder, severe; cannabis use \ndisorder, severe; and stimulant use disorder, severe. She found that these diagnoses \n\u201ccould pose a risk to his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness concerning classified \ninformation.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 3.c) AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and 28(c) apply. \nApplicant left inpatient substance abuse treatment at Treatment Center P \nabruptly and unilaterally in October 2017, without completing the treatment program or \nany of the follow-up aftercare recommendations. AG \u00b6 28(d) applies. \nApplicant went to the ER in December 2017 during an acute episode of anxiety. \nHe was not admitted. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) While he has suffered from anxiety since childhood, \nand this episode likely resulted from his condition(s), the incident itself, which occurred \nover five years ago and which did not lead to further treatment either then or later, is not \nsufficient to establish a current security concern. No disqualifying conditions apply to \nSOR \u00b6 3.b and it is found for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns over an applicant\u2019s \npsychological conditions are provided under AG \u00b6 29, as follows: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed\nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an\nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a\nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n14 \n\n \nApplicant has fairly recent diagnoses of major depressive disorder, moderate, \nrecurrent; alcohol use disorder, severe; cannabis use disorder, severe; and stimulant \nuse disorder, severe. Dr. B found that depressive disorder tends to be a chronic and a \nhighly recurrent condition. Applicant has experienced symptoms since childhood. She \nfound that his tendency to self-medicate, coupled with ongoing alcohol use, inadequate \ntreatment and, \u201cperhaps most importantly, limited insight and transparency, point to a \nguarded prognosis.\u201d Applicant is not in treatment for any of his diagnosed conditions. \nHe has not established that any Guideline I mitigating conditions should apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in June 2018, he failed to disclose any past \nillegal drug use in the previous seven years, specifically his use of marijuana at some \npoint in the previous seven years (after June 2011) and his 2017 use of cocaine. He \ntestified that he submitted his first SCA in 2014, and his clearance was granted later \nthat year. By his own admission, his 2017 cocaine use occurred while he possessed a \nsecurity clearance, something Applicant also did not disclose on his 2018 SCA. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) applies to both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.b. \nAfter his 2018 SCA, Applicant had three background interviews. In his second \ninterview, in May 2019, he was asked if he had used illegal drugs in the past seven \n15 \n\n \n \n \nyears, to include marijuana, and he said No. SOR \u00b6 4.c alleges that this was a \ndeliberately false statement. Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 4.c. AG \u00b6 16(b) is established. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant did not acknowledge his prior illegal drug use until the third interview, in \nJuly 2019, when he was confronted with evidence from his medical records. When \nconfronted, he said he believed it was not on record anywhere and was not a problem. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. The DOD evaluator also specifically cited Applicant\u2019s lack of \ncandor about his alcohol and illegal drug use as an ongoing concern. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and \n17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n16 \n\n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, H, I, and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nApplicant has yet to come to terms with the full extent of his psychological \nconditions or the security significance of his efforts to self-medicate with alcohol and \nillegal drugs. He also has an established history of minimizing his issues, in treatment, \nunder evaluation, and in the security clearance process. Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns about his alcohol involvement, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, psychological conditions, or personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.d: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n17 \n",

He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, and he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d, all with explanations. I incorporate his admission to SOR \u00b6 1.d into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information science in 2016. He has held multiple jobs in the information technology (IT) field since 2017, both in cleared and uncleared positions.

In February 2020, he was \nterminated from his employment in a later job following allegations of similar conduct. \nHe falsified information on two subsequent security clearance applications by \nmisrepresenting the nature of his departures from those employments. He did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the resulting personal conduct security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) in September 2019 \nand June 2020. On July 15, 2021, following a background investigation, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under \nGuideline E, personal conduct. The CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 26, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on May 4, 2022. On September 1, 2022, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for September 20, 2022, by video-teleconference through \nan online platform. \nApplicant\u2019s hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through F, all previously submitted with his answer. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. The record initially closed at the end of the hearing. The next \nday, Applicant requested additional time to submit letters of reference, so I reopened \nthe record to allow him the opportunity to do so. Applicant later submitted eight \nreference letters, which are marked as AE G through N and admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 29, 2022. The record closed \non October 6, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \u201cadmitted\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.a, but he provided an \nexplanation that I construe as a denial. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, and he admitted \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, all with explanations. I incorporate his admission to SOR \u00b6 1.d into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record \nevidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information science in 2016. He has held multiple jobs \nin the information technology (IT) field since 2017, both in cleared and uncleared \npositions. At times, including currently, he has held both full-time jobs during the week, \nand second jobs, either at night, or on the weekends. \nApplicant began working in IT with healthcare Company M in 2017, first as a\ncontractor, and then, as of March 2018, as a Company M employee. (Tr. 31-32, 50, 55-\n57; GE 1) He initially worked on weekends during the day. Then he was asked to work \n12 am to 8 am (Monday nights and Tuesday nights). (Tr. 55-57) His departure from \nCompany M in August 2019 is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.a, discussed below.\n \n \nFrom August 2018 to about December 2019, Applicant also had a full-time job \n(Monday to Friday, 9 to 5) with federal Contractor I. (Tr. 57-58; GE 2) After his \nclearance was granted in 2019, and after leaving Company M, Applicant was also a \nself-employed \u201c1099\u201d contractor with Company T from December 2019 to February \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020 as a systems administrator. His departure from Company T is the subject of SOR \n\u00b6 1.b, discussed below. (Tr. 48-50, 57-58) \nSince March 2020, Applicant has worked a full-time, weekday job for Contractor\nJ, a defense contractor who is his current employer and clearance sponsor. During \nmuch of this time, he has continued working nights as well, first with Company MS, from \nJanuary 2020 to July 2020; then with another government agency (AGA), from August \n2020 to August 2021, when the contract ended. He briefly had a second job at a health \nclub. Since March 2022, he has also worked a 40-hour night shift job outside the \ndefense industry, with Company IM. He therefore currently works two full-time 40-hour-\na-week jobs. (Tr. 48-54, 111-112, 116; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges first, that Applicant falsified time records while he was working \nat Company M, \u201crepresenting that you worked hours that you did not work.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.a \nalso alleges that Applicant \u201cresigned upon being advised that you were under \ninvestigation for falsification of time records.\u201d \nApplicant admitted that, \u201cat [Company M], I did falsify time records\u201d by \u201cclocking\nin hours where I wasn\u2019t, while I was not at the job,\u201d by taking advantage of the remote \nclock-in system. (Tr. 32-34) He acknowledged that as an IT help desk professional, he \nhad a responsibility to be available to help those who sought assistance. He had been \nable to leave early to go to his day job with Federal contractor I because he had a co-\nworker who would cover for him, which he said was common practice in IT. An \ninvestigation ensued when his practice was discovered, after the coworker who covered \nfor him was transferred to another location. (Tr. 34-37; GE 4) \n \nRecords from Company M showed several occasions during July and August \n2019 when Applicant: a) clocked in remotely at his start time, but actually showed up \n15-30 minutes later; and b) left his job before 6 am, but clocked out about three hours \nlater, at about 8:30 am, at the end of his shift. (GE 3 at 9; GE 4, Tr. 39, 60-64) \nApplicant also acknowledged that on multiple occasions during this time, he \nfalsified time records for an entire eight-hour shift, to make it appear that he had worked \n40 hours a week, when he had only worked 32 hours. He did this for a period of about \ntwo to three months in 2019 (Tr. 41-42, 58-59, 67-69, 110-111; GE 4) He acknowledged \nthat he was essentially stealing from his employer by doing so. He was an hourly \nemployee, and he said he did it to make more money. (Tr. 77, 110-111) \nApplicant was confronted about his conduct in a phone call with his Company M \nsupervisors on Thursday, August 1, 2019. He said he was told that an investigation was \npending and was told to turn in his equipment and to go home, which he did. He \nconsidered that he was essentially suspended because he could not work without his \nequipment. (Tr. 89-90) \nThe next evening, Applicant received a text from a co-worker, who had heard \nthat Applicant had been terminated. (AE D, AE E, AE F) Applicant submitted his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresignation the next day, on Saturday, August 3, 2019, apparently by e-mail but also by \nfax. (GE 4) He had not heard confirmation from his manager \u201cabout being let go\u201d before \nhe did so. (Tr. 33-34, 70-72, 88-89; Answer) \nApplicant acknowledged being told in the August 1 meeting that he was \nsuspended. (Tr. 72-73) He also acknowledged being concerned about his job status \nafter his friend texted him: \u201cThat\u2019s when I took the, I guess, I just went forward [with] just \nresigning because I didn\u2019t know and I was worried, you know, at that point. It was like, \nrace is on.\u201d (Tr. 74, 75) \nApplicant also asserted that had he not been told by his friend that he had been \nterminated, that he had \u201cevery intention of going through with the investigation\u201d and \nreturning to work the following Monday. He acknowledged that he resigned before \nconfirming whether or not he would be fired. (Tr. 76, 88-89, 91, 93) \nApplicant\u2019s faxed resignation was received at Company M the following Monday, \nAugust 5, 2019. In the letter, he gives no reason for his departure, which was \u201ceffective \nimmediately.\u201d His resignation was confirmed and accepted by his employer, and \nconsidered effective as of Saturday, August 3, 2019. (GE 4) GE 4 includes a company \n\u201cRecord of Conference\u201d about the August 1 phone call, prepared on August 5. There is \na notation that Applicant \u201cresigned,\u201d but he did not sign it. Under \u201cAction Taken by \nSupervisor, the box marked \u201cTermination\u201d is checked. The document also says \nApplicant \u201celected to resign in lieu of termination.\u201d (GE 4) Applicant said he was not \naware of GE 4 until two years later. (Tr. 69-71) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment contract \nwith Contractor T for falsification of time records in February 2020. Applicant admitted \nhe was terminated but denied falsifying time records. Essentially, he questioned why he \nwould be so foolish as to do so soon after being terminated by Company M for doing the \nsame thing. He said it would have been \u201cstupid to steal time and defraud the \nGovernment of all places, to do that with my prior history.\u201d (Tr. 42-44; GE 3 at 2) \nFrom December 2019 to February 2020, Applicant was a self-employed \u201c1099\u201d \ncontractor with Company T working as a systems administrator. He said that he had to \nenter and exit the government facility with a common access card (CAC), and he had to \nprepare a timesheet for his work. He had to log in and out on-site, via e-mail. (Tr. 86, \n118-121; GE 3 at 11-12) He said he left the job in part because he had been hired by \nanother employer, but also because he was terminated. He acknowledged he had been \nterminated following an allegation of falsifying his time, but he denied any timecard \nfalsification. (Tr. 87, 95, 99-100, 104, 118, 121) \nAE B is a text exchange between Applicant and Ms. L, his supervisor at \nContractor T, between February 27 and March 17, 2020, after he had left. It concerned \nthe company\u2019s need for him to provide time cards documenting the hours he had \nworked, as well as Applicant\u2019s concern about being paid. One text from Ms. L says, in \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npart, \u201cwe are waiting for the government and [a related customer, P] to tell us how many\nhours must be repaid. I will let you know as soon as I know. (AE B)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn March 27, 2020, Ms. L emailed Applicant and said, \n\u201cWe are still waiting to hear from [customer P]. In the interim, we are \nwilling to pay you for the remaining 96 hours that you entered on [the time \ncard] as long as you reimburse us for any cost or refunds we may have to \npay to [customer P] if they request a refund due to the discrepancy \nbetween your [ ] timecard and the Government\u2019s \u201cbadge-in log.\u201d If you \nagree, please respond, \u201cAgreed\u201d to this e-mail and we will do a direct \ndeposit into the account we have on file on March 31, 2020. If not, we will \nhave to wait for [customer P] to respond before we pay you. Thanks. \nApplicant responded minutes later: \u201cAgreed.\u201d \nMs. L then responded that \u201cWe will make a deposit on March 31, 2020.\u201d (AE C) \nApplicant then asserted to Ms. L that he should be paid based on a higher pay \nrate, effective January 2020 ($3,672 total instead of $3,096). (AE C) He testified that \nCompany T paid him the full amount he requested. (Tr. 44-45, 100-103) Department \nCounsel acknowledged that there was no record evidence of a timecard discrepancy \nbeyond what was referenced in Applicant\u2019s documents. (Tr. 104) \nIn reporting the circumstances of his August 2019 departure from Company M on \nhis September 2019 SCA, Applicant wrote the following: \nI resigned due to wanting to free up time for my family. I was working 7 \ndays a week with this job from Saturday to Monday. I now currently work 5 \ndays a week. (GE 1 at 15; Tr. 79) \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the next question on his SCA, asking, as to this \nemployment, if he had been fired, quit after being told he would be fired, or left by \nmutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct, or notice of \nunsatisfactory performance. (GE 1 at 15) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant\u2019s stated reason for leaving Company M and his \nnegative answer to the next question on GE 1 were deliberately false. He asserted in \nhis Answer and in his testimony that he had not lied because he had not been fired nor \ndid he resign having been told he would be fired, and there was no mutual agreement \nabout the reason for his departure. (Answer) \nAt his hearing, however, Applicant acknowledged, that his given reason of \nwanting to spend more time with his family \u201cwas not entirely true.\u201d (Tr. 92) He \nacknowledged that, while he had not been terminated, he quit because of the rumor that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe would be fired. (Tr. 80-81) He denied that he left after a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d following \nallegations of misconduct or poor performance. (Tr. 82-83) \nWhen Applicant submitted his second SCA (GE 2) in June 2020, he did not\nchange any of the information he had previously provided on his prior application (GE 1)\nabout his departure from Company M. (GE 2 at 19). He acknowledged that he \u201cglazed \nover\u201d the information on GE 2 and did not review it as closely as he should have. (Tr.\n94) Falsification of that question on GE 2, as to Company M, is not alleged in the SOR.\n \n \n \n \nIn disclosing the job with Contractor T on GE 2, Applicant listed the name of his \nsupervisor, Ms. L, but did not list the name of the company, and did not report that he \nhad been terminated. He wrote that he \u201cleft for new employment because I was hired for \nan entirely different job than what my employment title stated. . . .\u201d (GE 2 at 16) He \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the next question, asking if for this employment, he had been fired, \nquit after being told he would be fired, or left by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct, or notice of unsatisfactory performance. (GE 2 at 17) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant\u2019s stated reason for leaving Contractor J and his \nnegative answer to the next question on GE 2 were deliberately false. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted the allegation, and said, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know why I tried to conceal \nthis particular information, and it was stupid to try and do so, especially when I know the \ntruth. . .\u201d He noted that he later volunteered the information to the investigator. He also \nsaid his given reason was not \u201centirely false\u201d since he had another job that he \ninterviewed for and began soon thereafter. (Answer) When asked about this at his \nhearing, he offered no excuse and said it was a poor decision. He acknowledged that \nhis termination related to an allegation of falsified time cards, but he again denied that \nhe did so. (Tr. 106-107) \nApplicant did not have a background interview after his first SCA. (Tr. 47) \nFollowing his second SCA, he was twice interviewed in July 2020. During the second \nsuch interview, he denied facing any disciplinary actions or suspensions in the previous \n10 years, and he said he had not quit a job after being told he would be fired. He also \ndid not disclose his timesheet falsification at Company M until he was confronted about \nit by the interviewer. (Tr. 84-85; GE 3 at 8-9) \nLater the same day, in July 2020, Applicant called the interviewer and \nvolunteered that he had been terminated from Contractor T in February 2020 following \nan allegation of stealing time. He said he was removed from the contract after the \ngovernment contractor compared the times he times he entered and left the building \nwith his CAC card against his timesheet and there were discrepancies. Applicant denied \nthe allegation that he had stolen time. (GE 3 at 11-12; Tr. 88, 107-109) \nApplicant earns a $102,000 salary for contractor J (full-time) and a $74,000 \nsalary for company IM (also full time). His two jobs are about 20 miles apart in the \nsuburbs of the large metropolitan area where he works. (Tr. 111-112) He attested that \nthere is no risk of future recurrence. He said both employers know he works two jobs, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand have no issue with it. He loves his job as a contractor with the AGA, has worked \nthere for almost three years, and has had no disciplinary issues. Previously, he \nacknowledged that he was \u201ctrying to do too much.\u201d (Tr. 113-114) \nApplicant said he has learned from his mistakes. He acknowledged that he did \nmake good decisions at the time. He is maturing and trying to make better decisions. If \nhe is tired or overworked, he needs to cut back. It is not worth trying to cheat people. It \nputs his team in a bad position and \u201cthat\u2019s not right.\u201d (Tr. 127) He apologized for his \nactions as he concluded. (Tr. 131) \nAE A is a December 2019 email in which Applicant inquired about being rehired \nby Company M. He was told there were no weekend positions available. \nApplicant provided eight recommendation letters from references. All but one of \nthem are from co-workers and supervisors from his contractor position with the AGA, \nincluding the office\u2019s chief of staff, executive officer (a major general), a major, the chief \ninformation officer, the lead IT analyst, the chief of personnel, and an executive \nassistant. They attest that Applicant is exceptionally reliable and trustworthy, remarkably \ndependable, and an innovative problem solver. He has integrity, and his references all \nendorse his eligibility for a clearance. A final reference, from a job Applicant held at a \nfitness center, also attested to his positive character and work ethic. (AE G \u2013 AE N) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer . . . ; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, \nbut which, \nwhen combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is not \nlimited to, consideration of: . . . \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \nWhile working for Company M, in the summer of 2019, Applicant was found to \nhave clocked in and clocked out remotely at the start and end of his shift, on multiple \noccasions and then found to have showed up late, and left early, even hours early. \nApplicant also admitted that on multiple occasions, he submitted time for eight-hour \nshifts he did not work, thereby falsely representing to his employer that he worked a full \n40-hour-work week (and, accordingly, was paid for it when he should not have been). \nHe was working two jobs at the time, working days for a federal contractor and nights or \nweekends for healthcare Company M. He was burning the candle at both ends and not \nfulfilling his obligations to work the required hours. He got caught, was confronted, sent \nhome, and soon heard a rumor that he had been terminated. If he had not yet been \nterminated, he was probably about to be. Rather than wait until Monday to confirm this, \nApplicant chose to resign over the weekend. SOR \u00b6 1.a is established. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), \n16(d)(3) and 16(d(4) apply. \nIn SOR \u00b6 1.b, the Government alleged that Applicant was terminated from his \nemployment with contractor T in February 2020 for falsification of time records. \nApplicant consistently denied the allegation. He acknowledged that there was a dispute \nor discrepancy between his hours and the log-in or badge-in data at the job, though that \ndata is not in the record. He disputed that he engaged in falsifying time records, noting \nthat he it would be \u201cstupid\u201d to do at his next job what got him in trouble at his prior job. \nHe also noted that he was paid for the time at issue after he left. \nThe record therefore establishes that Applicant was terminated by Contractor T, \nin February 2020. By his own admission, he was terminated following an allegation of \nstealing time. However, whether he actually did so at Contractor T is not established. In \ndenying SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant put the burden on the Government to establish it. The \nGovernment did not done so. SOR \u00b6 1.b is not established. \nApplicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.c on the grounds that the circumstances of his \ndeparture from Company M were not reportable on GE 1, because, he asserts, he was \nnot fired, he did not quit after being told he would be fired, and he did not leave by \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nmutual agreement following allegations of misconduct or poor performance. He asserts \nthat since he resigned before confirming the rumor that he had been terminated, his \naction was not reportable. This is hairsplitting at best, and given that he resigned on a \nSaturday and in his own words, the \u201crace was on\u201d (before he could be fired, as \nsuggested strongly by GE 4). His excuse for not reporting this incident is not credible. \nFurther, his other statement on GE 1, that he left the job to spend more time with his \nfamily, is simply false. I therefore find that Applicant made at least one deliberately false \nstatement on GE 1 as to his departure from Company M. SOR \u00b6 1.c is established, and \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nA security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or \nparse the truth narrowly. The government has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information. That compelling interest includes the government's \nlegitimate interest in being able to make sound decisions, based on complete and \naccurate information, about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government \nin connection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the \nintegrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n8, 2002) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d, concerning his failure to disclose his termination \nfrom Contractor T in February 2020 on GE 2. Even if the alleged reason for the \ntermination is not established, he had a duty to disclose it. He did not, and admitted \nfailing to do so deliberately, without an excuse. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment of falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant made false statements on two clearance applications, one in 2019 and \none in 2020, about the circumstances under which he departed from two recent jobs, \nalso in 2019 and 2020. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to the allegations of falsification. \n10 \n\n \n \nApplicant resigned from Company M after he was confronted about logging in \nbefore showing up to work and logging off several hours early. He also submitted \nrecords of eight hours of work he never did on several occasions. He did so because he \nwas leaving his night job early to get to his day job as a federal contractor. Even now, \nApplicant is again working two jobs, and two 40-hour-a week jobs at that. This means \nthat there is a reasonable and foreseeable risk that he will once again become \noverextended. Even though he is now salaried instead of an hourly employee, there \nremains a risk that Applicant will find himself in a similar situation and exercise poor \njudgment in terms of managing his time, workload, or compliance with rules and \nregulations. While I credit his numerous letters of recommendation from his Army \nsupervisors attesting to his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, he has not shown \nthat his actions happened under such unique circumstances that they are unlikely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant is given credit under AG \u00b6 17(a) for voluntarily disclosing to the \ninvestigator the fact of the second termination, and the fact that it concerned a \n(disputed) allegation of falsifying time records. However, this is not enough to mitigate \nhis other conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. As noted, I considered the numerous letters \nof recommendation Applicant provided, from a wide variety of people at work who know \nhim well. He was also remorseful, and now better understands the problems with what \nhe did. But that evidence in mitigation must be balanced against his pattern of conduct, \nincluding falsifications and work-related rule violations, and the risk of recurrence. \n11 \n\n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for continued access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

DOHA provided notice to Applicant that he had 30 days from \nthe receipt of the FORM to provide objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation, as appropriate. Applicant received the FORM on December 8, 2022, and he \ndid not submit any information within the 30-day period. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 9, 2023. I admitted into evidence the Government exhibits (Items 1-17), without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 45 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 2001. He served \non active duty until he received an honorable discharge in December 2006. In March \n2007, he joined the Army National Guard, and he continues his military service to the \npresent time.

Since October 2014, \nhe has been employed by a federal contractor as a systems technician. He has \npossessed a DOD security clearance since approximately 2014. (Item 3) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted to 14 creditors for \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $64,400. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \ncredit bureau reports in evidence support the SOR Guideline F allegations. \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in February 2020, \nand he disclosed one delinquent personal loan in the amount of $5,000. During his April \n2020 background interview, Applicant told the authorized DOD investigator that his \nsecurity clearance was administratively suspended in February 2020 because he had not \nturned in a completed SCA, as requested. Once he turned in the SCA, his security \nclearance was reinstated in March 2020. He also told the investigator that his wages were \nbeing garnished by another creditor in the amount of about $900 monthly. When asked \nabout any other delinquent accounts, Applicant stated that he was unable to collect \nenough information on his delinquent debts due to the limited amount of time he had to \nturn in his SCA. (Item 4) \nThe investigator confronted Applicant with several outstanding accounts obtained \nfrom a credit report. Applicant stated that beginning in 2015, he traveled frequently out-\nof-state to care for his elderly parents. The traveling and medical expenses over the years \ncontributed to his financial problems. In 2018, he attempted to use a consumer credit \ncounseling service to consolidate his debts, but he soon learned the service used \nnegotiated settlements to resolve delinquent debts. He withdrew from the program, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe was unable to make payments on his delinquent accounts. He currently works full time \nand has the financial means to make payments on these accounts. (Items 3 and 4) \nBased on the credit reports in evidence, Applicant has experienced financial issues \nfor at least two decades. In January 2005, the Army made a preliminary decision to deny \nhis security clearance. His security clearance was ultimately granted on appeal, and he \nwas issued a warning that subsequent unfavorable information may result in the \nsuspension of his security clearance. (Items 3, 4, 10, 11 and 12) \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nApplicant has been arrested five times since 1998. At least three of these arrests \ninvolved alcohol. In November 1998, he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence \n(DUI) after he drove his car into another vehicle. He entered into a diversion program with \nconditions, to include alcohol education, 90-day license suspension, and a $1,029 fine. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested for his second DUI in May 2005. He \nadmitted at the time of his arrest he had consumed about six or seven beers and failed a \nsobriety test. His blood alcohol content tested three times over the legal limit. Applicant \npleaded guilty, and he was sentenced to three days in the workhouse, fined, and placed \non probation for one year. \nIn June 2011, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault. During a 2014 \ninterview, he admitted having grabbed his then-spouse during an argument. During his \ncurrent investigation, he denied any physical violence related to the incident. The charge \nagainst Applicant was dismissed after he completed an anger management program. \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant was arrested for his third DUI in June 2017. He \nadmitted drinking one shot of whiskey and four or five beers before driving home. This \narrest occurred despite Applicant\u2019s previous declaration following his second DUI that he \nwould never drink and drive again. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in the early morning hours of March \n22, 2020, for fleeing the scene of an auto collision. He initially stated that he had struck \nan unknown co-worker\u2019s car while leaving the office. In response to a government \ninterrogatory, Applicant stated that he was following his friend \u201cback from my house to my \ngirlfriend\u2019s house\u201d when at approximately 2:30 a.m. he struck his friend\u2019s car while \nattempting to pass him. Rather than speak to his friend about the accident at the scene, \nhe stated: \nI tried to call [my friend] hoping we could talk on the phone about the \ndamages.

(Item 4) \nApplicant denied alcohol was a factor in the incident but admitted he continues to \nregularly consume alcohol. There was no explanation given for his inconsistent \nstatement concerning the accident. (Item 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts totaling $64,400 establishes \nthe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has approximately $64,400 in delinquent debt. \nThere is evidence in the record that he experienced financial hardship after traveling out-\nof-state to attend to his elderly parents and the unforeseen expenses associated with the \ntravel and their medical care. This is a circumstance beyond his control, but he must also \nshow that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve his financial issues.  \nThere is little information in the record to show why Applicant was unable to make \nbetter progress with his delinquent accounts, especially noting that he has been \ncontinuously employed by a federal contractor since 2014. In 2018, he attempted to use \na consumer credit counseling service to consolidate his debts, but he withdrew from this \nprogram once he learned this service negotiated with the creditors to settle outstanding \naccounts instead of debt consolidation. Thereafter, he never enlisted the services of a \nconsumer debt consolidation program, and his inability or unwillingness to pay these \noutstanding accounts continued. \nApplicant did not provide supporting documentation with his SOR Answer, or after \nhe received the Government\u2019s FORM. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show \nthat he has either paid, is paying, or is actively working to resolve any of his delinquent \naccounts. He denied two of the delinquent accounts in his Answer, but he did not give an \nadequate explanation as to why he denied these accounts. Allowing his financial \nproblems to persist for multiple years does not support a finding that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. All of Applicant\u2019s alleged debts are still ongoing and unresolved. \nHis failure to adequately resolve his debts over time indicates his financial issues are a \ncontinuing concern. For the forgoing reasons, Applicant failed to establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). Applicant was arrested \non three occasions for DUI between 1998 and 2017. His blood alcohol content (BAC) in \na breathalyzer was three times the legal standard for driving under the influence. The \nlevel of his BAC establishes binge alcohol consumption. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for three alcohol-related offenses in 1998, 2005, and 2017. \nThere is nothing in the record to show that he had been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder, or that he failed to follow treatment recommendations once diagnosed. Although \nhis repeated alcohol-related offenses are troubling, six years have passed without further \nalcohol-related incidents. Enough time has passed to show his past alcohol-related \nmisconduct no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Applicant successfully mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One potentially applies: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b). Applicant was involved in \nmultiple arrests from 1998 to 2020. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is concerning, especially in the context of his \ncontinuous possession of a DOD security clearance since approximately 2014. His \ncriminal conduct included arrests for multiple violations between 1998 and 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent statement about the circumstances leading up to his most recent \narrest in 2020 is also troubling. I find that Applicant has established a pattern of criminal \nconduct, and he is either unable or unwilling to follow rules, laws, or regulations. His \nrepeated criminal misconduct demonstrates poor judgment and shows he does not learn \nfrom past mistakes. There is insufficient evidence in the record to establish successful \nrehabilitation, or to demonstrate that his criminal conduct will not recur. I find that more \ntime is needed to ensure that he does not repeat additional criminal violations. As such, \nhis behavior continues to cast doubt on his current reliability and good judgment. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 32. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, G, and J \nand the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has demonstrated that he is unable to follow rules, laws, and regulations, \nand his pattern of rule violations is long. Access to classified and protected information \nrequires faithful adherence to the rules and regulations governing such activity. A person \nwho fails to address concerns, even after having been placed on notice that his or her \naccess is in jeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are at stake. \nApplicant has not acted responsibly by failing to address his financial \ndelinquencies. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case, I conclude Applicant has mitigated alcohol \nconsumption concerns, but he has not met his burden of proof and persuasion to mitigate \nthe financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. - 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. - 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He holds the position of Help Desk Administrator. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment with a defense contractor. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR identified twelve delinquent student loan debts totaling $71,150. Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline. A credit report of the Applicant dated January 29, 2021, confirms the indebtedness listed in the SOR. (Government Exhibit 2.) Applicant attended college from 2005 to 2009. To pay for his education, he obtained student loans totaling about $60,000. He graduated from college in 2009, and joined the U.S. Air force. He served in the Air Force from November 2009 to January 2019. While in the Air Force, Applicant was deployed overseas for about eight years, and his student loans were deferred for about six or seven of those deployment years. (Tr. p. 21.)

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865 (EO), Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 20, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2022.

The record remained open following the hearing, until close of business on \nNovember 15, 2022, to allow the Applicant to submit additional supporting \ndocumentation. \nApplicant submitted four additional documents referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A through D, which was admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 18, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old. He is married with one child, and one \u201con the way.\u201d \nHe has a bachelor\u2019s degree in Information Management Systems. He holds the position \nof Help Desk Administrator. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment with a defense contractor. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR identified twelve delinquent student loan debts totaling $71,150. \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline. A credit report \nof the Applicant dated January 29, 2021, confirms the indebtedness listed in the SOR. \n(Government Exhibit 2.)  \nApplicant attended college from 2005 to 2009. To pay for his education, he \nobtained student loans totaling about $60,000. He graduated from college in 2009, and \njoined the U.S. Air force. He served in the Air Force from November 2009 to January \n2019. \nWhile in the Air Force, Applicant was deployed overseas for about eight years, \nand his student loans were deferred for about six or seven of those deployment years. \n(Tr. p. 21.) He achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant, E-5, and an honorable discharge. \nApplicant has been employed with a U.S. defense contractor since January \n2019, and he currently resides in Japan. He testified that he first learned that his \nstudent loans were in default sometime in 2015/2016. (Tr. p. 42.) At that time, he did \nnothing to address the loans. He stated that it was not until he received the SOR in July \n2021, that he knew who to contact about his student loan debt and took some action. \nA letter from the Applicant indicates that he has reached out to these creditors and set \nup a payment plan to get the loans out of their delinquent status. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nA.) \nHe testified that in November 2021, he received correspondence from the \nGovernment about his student loans, listing a contact telephone number, advising him \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n     \n \non how to rehabilitate his loan status, and how to apply for Federal Student Loan Debt \nRelief. Applicant testified that he has not yet had the chance to call them. (Tr. p. 29.) \nApplicant stated that his student loans were sold and were split between two \ndifferent creditors. \nAt some point, he thought that he owed Creditor A a total of \n$52,262; and Creditor B $18,863. Concerning Creditor A, Applicant stated that he is \ncurrently going through the process of loan rehabilitation. To pull his loan out of default \nstatus, he must make the required payments for several months to complete the \nrehabilitation process before he is allowed to start a payment plan. He stated that he \nhas paid $150 monthly for five months so far while in rehabilitation. Once he completes \nthe rehabilitation process, he will be permitted to set up a payment plan with the \ncreditor, to begin to resolve the debt. He stated that he plans to begin his regular \nmonthly payments plan in January 2023. (Tr. p. 36.) Concerning Creditor B, Applicant \nstated that he is required to pay $250 monthly through the rehabilitation process before \nhe can start their payment program. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits B and C.) \nApplicant testified that his wife is pregnant with their second child. She earns \nabout $25,000 annually. Applicant earns about $67,000 annually. He has $2,800 in his \nchecking account, and $15,000 in his savings account. (Tr. p. 47.) He believes that \neven with the new baby and the related expenses, he can also afford to pay his regular \nmonthly expenses, and make his payments towards resolving his student loan debt. \nApplicant stated that when he starts his payment plan with the creditors he understands \nthat he will be making payments for more than ten years to resolve these debts. (Tr. pp. \n47-53.) \nThe following delinquent debts are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent student loan in the \namount of $3,324 that was placed for collection. Applicant stated that he is in the \nprocess of loan rehabilitation and plans to start making his first payment in January \n2023. (Tr. p. 43.) The debt remains owing. \n1.b. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent student loan in the \namount of $6,986 that was placed for collection. Applicant stated that he is in the \nprocess of loan rehabilitation and plans to start making his first payment in January \n2023. (Tr. p. 43.) The debt remains owing. \n1.c. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent student loan in the amount \nof $4,433 that was placed for collection. Applicant stated that he is in the process of \nloan rehabilitation and plans to start making his first payment in January 2023. (Tr. p. \n43.) The debt remains owing. \n1.d. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a delinquent student loan in the amount \nof $6,816 that was placed for collection. \nApplicant stated that he is in the process of \nloan rehabilitation and plans to start making his first payment in January 2023.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not addressing his financial obligations, namely his \nstudent loan debts. \nHis actions or inactions both demonstrate a history of not \naddressing his debt and/or an inability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant incurred delinquent student loan debt after graduating from college in \n2009. He has ignored the debts for about thirteen years. Only recently, after receiving \nthe SOR in July 2021, did he make any effort to address these debts. Even so, he still \nremains in rehabilitation status, which means that he has yet to make his first payment. \nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and inaction for so long casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant appears to want to resolve his \ndebt but has work to do to achieve this.  At this time, Applicant needs more time to show \nthe Government that he will properly resolve his financial delinquencies with regular \nsystematic payments and consistency. He has started the rehabilitation process to pull \nhis loans out of default status, but nothing more. No regular monthly payments have \nbeen started. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant has made a \ngood-faith effort to resolve his debts. Overall, Applicant shows little progress towards \nresolving his debts. \nHe has started the rehabilitation process, but has not yet \ncompleted it in order to start making his first payment. He owes a significant amount of \nmoney to these creditors. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that he \nhas carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security \nconcerns under Guideline F. Accordingly, guideline F is found against the Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information, but not at this time. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through  1.l.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. at 21-25, 35-42, 54-58, \n85; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, S, AA) \nApplicant is part owner of his company, which was a Subchapter S corporation. \nHis interest was about 21.5% in 2016. In order to be competitive on a large contract, the \ncompany needed to bring in experienced workers. The company used partial ownership \nas a recruitment tool. As part of that process, in 2017, the company was converted to a \nlimited liability company (LLC). Applicant\u2019s ownership was involuntarily diluted to about \n6.5%, but he received $3 million as compensation for his share of the company. He felt \nthat he did not receive a fair deal. The $3 million was to be paid in quarterly installments \nover several years, but the tax liability for the capital gains was completely in tax year \n2017. He received payments of about $900,000 in 2017, and the rest in later years. The \ncompany won a $900 million contract. (Tr. at 26-35, 58-62, 66, 72-73; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE D, E) \nApplicant has a history of tax issues. He did not file his 2016 through 2019 \nfederal and state income tax returns when they were due, and he failed to pay his 2016 \nthrough 2018 federal and state income taxes when they were due. The forms from his \ncompany that were necessary to file his returns were always late, but not to the extent \nthat it justified how late his returns were. He had the means to pay the taxes when they \nwere due, even in 2017 when the large capital gains tax was due. He does not excuse \nhis failures, but the stress of dealing with his mother, his now ex-wife, his children, and \nthe issues with his company, distracted him from resolving his tax problems.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2016 through 2019 federal and state income tax returns \nwhen they were due, and he failed to pay his 2016 through 2018 federal and state \nincome taxes when they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his tax failures. He does not excuse his \nfailures, but the stress of dealing with his mother, his now ex-wife, his children, and the \nissues with his company, distracted him from resolving his tax problems. All of the old \nreturns have been filed, and all of his past-due taxes have been paid. AG \u00b6 20(g) is \napplicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed and the taxes \npaid. \nAs a longtime clearance holder and FSO, Applicant knew that failure to adhere to \ntax laws could affect his security clearance. He knew that he had an obligation to report \nhis tax issues to the DOD, but he chose not to for several years until he submitted the \nSF 86. He reported his 2016 to 2018 tax issues on his April 2020 SF 86, and he \ndiscussed the matters during his August 2020 background interview. He stated that he \nfiled all of the returns in November 2019 and made all the payments in full, as required. \nHe stated that he had no issues with his 2019 tax filings. After submitting his SF 86 and \ncompleting his background interview, Applicant was late filing his 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns and paying the taxes owed. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes \non time continues to raise doubts about his judgment, reliability and willingness to follow \nrules and regulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns and paid taxes is \ninsufficient to overcome the years of Applicant shirking his responsibility to file his tax \nreturns and pay his taxes. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.2 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n2 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded a \nconditional clearance in this case is not warranted. \n8 \n",

Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that has been charged off in \nthe approximate amount of $5,371. This is a lending club loan that Applicant took out in \n2010 to pay for household expenses. Applicant made regular monthly payments to \nresolve the debt and by June 21, 2023, he has reduced it to $3,271. (Tr. p. 28.) A letter \nfrom the collection agency dated August 8, 2023, indicates that they received a \npayment of $1,000 from the Applicant on July 31, 2023, and the debt is settled in full. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit F.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has addressed each of his delinquent debts. He is now living within his \nmeans. He has set up a financial budget that he is following to prevent overspending in \nthe future. After paying his regular monthly expenses, and the remaining monthly \npayments towards his few delinquent debts, sometimes he has some discretionary \nmoney left over, and some times he does not. He explained that his new girlfriend is \nfinancially responsible. She works for the same defense contractor that he does, she \nlives within her means at all times, and she holds a security clearance. They live \ntogether now, and share financial responsibilities in the household, including the \nmortgage payment. \nStaying financially responsible is key to their relationship. \nApplicant is no longer the sole supporter of the household. Applicant earns about \n$90,000 annually. His girlfriend earns about $130,000 annually, and she contributes to \nthe mortgage and household expenses. Applicant has about $150,000 in his 401k. \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s divorce decree, he will soon be giving his ex-wife about \n$30,000 from his 401k. He has about $1,200 in his savings account, and $500 in his \nchecking account. He is now focused on living more frugally and being financially \nresponsible. \nApplicant was hired by his current employer in 2009 as an Electronic Technician. \nOver the years, he has received promotions and raises and other job opportunities due \nto his hard work and diligence. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit H.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant and his ex-wife had a habit of spending beyond their means. They \nused credit cards to support their lifestyle for many years. As a result, their debt \naccumulated and eventually became delinquent because they could not afford their \nlifestyle. His actions or inactions both demonstrated a history of not addressing his debt \nand an inability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant and his wife are now divorced. In addition to the costs involved in a \ndivorce, Applicant has addressed each of the debts listed in the SOR. Even before he \nreceived the SOR, he was either making regular monthly payments to resolve them or \nhe had already paid off the debt. He clearly understands the importance of being \nresponsible and trustworthy in every aspect of his life, including his finances. He also \nknows that he must live within his means in order to show that he is financially \nresponsible. He can no longer spend recklessly and without concern like he once did. \nApplicant has modified his spending habits, and set up a financial budget that he is \nfollowing in order to be financially responsible. \nIn addition, Applicant has a new girlfriend who works for the same company he \nworks for, and she holds a security clearance. \nHe stated that she is financially \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible and that she has been helpful to him in demonstrating financial \nresponsibility. They now share the household expenses and live within their means. \nApplicant has made a good faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts and they are \nclose to all being paid off. He has demonstrated responsibility and good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \nMitigating conditions \n20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are \napplicable. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been or are being resolved. \nOverall, Applicant has shown significant \nprogress towards resolving his debts. There is also sufficient evidence in the record to \nshow that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \ngovernment security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant must continue \nto follow through with his commitment to show financial responsibility in the future, or he \nwill once again be in jeopardy of losing his security clearance and access to classified \ninformation. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption  \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has six alcohol-related convictions between 2009 and as recently as \nDecember 2022. As of the date of the hearing, his driver\u2019s license was restricted, he was \non probation, and he was in a 19-week outpatient alcohol program for his 2022 alcohol-\nrelated conviction. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. Potentially applicable is AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the \nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s six alcohol-related convictions between 2009 and as recently as \nDecember 2022 continue to raise doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. While he has not consumed alcohol since December 2022, his driver\u2019s license \nwas still restricted, he was still on probation, and he had yet to complete the court-ordered \noutpatient program. He needs more time to show that he has matured and learned from \nhis poor decisions. I find that AG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to \naffect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and \nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual \nwas formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nIn addition to his alcohol-related convictions, as discussed above in my analysis \nunder Guideline G, Applicant has three reckless-driving-related convictions, from 2010 \nand two from 2019. He also has two assault charges from 2014 and 2019 involving his \nthen-girlfriend, now fianc\u00e9e. As of the date of the hearing, he remained on probation for \nhis December 2022 alcohol-related conviction. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor the same reasons stated above in my Guideline G analysis, I find that not \nenough time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior and without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, and the record evidence continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J. in \nmy whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not file as required his federal (SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for the 2018 tax year.

The case was assigned to me on October 25, 2022, and I scheduled a \nhearing to be held on December 8, 2022, via online video teleconferencing.

In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the \nallegations without comments. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. \nAt the outset, I resolve SOR 1.a and 1.b for Applicant. In his July 29, 2021, \nresponse to interrogatories propounded by Department Counsel, Applicant presented \nsubstantial information showing he filed his 2018 and 2019 income tax returns in 2020. \nAvailable information shows that the late filing of his taxes was an isolated event caused \nby circumstances beyond his control, that he has otherwise complied with his tax \nreporting obligations, and that he does not owe any unpaid taxes. (GX 2; Tr. 21, 34 \u2013 35, \n38 \u2013 39, 49) \nApplicant is 38 years old and is employed in an information technology (IT) position \nby a defense contractor, for whom he has worked since August 2019 after a three-month \nperiod of unemployment. Except for brief periods of unemployment due to the end of \ncontracts, he generally has been steadily employed since about July 2007, when he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompleted his studies at a technical institute. Since November 2016, he has worked \nprimarily for federal contractors. (GX 1; GX 2) \nApplicant and his wife have been married since August 2010, but they have been \nseparated since August 2018. Applicant petitioned for divorce in February 2019, and a \nhearing to finalize their divorce is scheduled for the end of May 2023. Applicant and his \nwife have two children, ages 16 and 10. Between 2018 and 2020, the children lived with \ntheir mother and Applicant paid her $1,860 for monthly support. Applicant has had sole \ncustody of his children since then and his wife is now required to pay him the same for \nmonthly support. She satisfied that obligation through an involuntary wage garnishment \nuntil August 2022, when she moved to another state. She now owes him about $7,000 in \nunpaid support. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 25 \u2013 27, 39 \u2013 40) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a combination of the effects of a \nserious car accident in 2014, his estranged wife\u2019s financial malfeasance while they were \ntogether, and the expenses associated with their pending divorce. He also recently began \ncaring for and financially supporting his mother. (GX 2; Tr. 11) \nDuring their marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife did not work outside the home and did not \ncontribute financially. In 2017, Applicant started traveling for work three weeks out of each \nmonth on average. While he was away, he had to rely on her to manage their finances; \nhowever, in 2017 and 2018, she failed to pay their rent on time to such an extent that they \nwere evicted for non-payment from one residence and accrued significant late fees and \nforfeitures of deposits at another. Also, during this period, she opened several credit \naccounts under his name and neglected to pay them as required. When they separated \nin 2018, Applicant had to fund both his own residence and a residence for his wife and \nchildren. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 23 \u2013 25) \nOn May 30, 2014, Applicant was injured in a car accident and was unable to work\nfor nine months. He supported himself and his family through workman\u2019s compensation \npayments and drawing on his savings. The medical and commercial debts alleged in the \nSOR first became past due in late 2014 and early 2015 because of his loss of income in \n2014. Additionally, some of the pain medication prescribed for Applicant included \ncontrolled substances. When he was hired by a federal contractor in 2018, he was still \ntaking some of those medications and reported his circumstance to his facility security \nofficer (FSO), who subsequently reported it through the Joint Personnel Adjudication \nSystem (JPAS). This had the unintended result of placing a hold on Applicant\u2019s ability to \nobtain a security clearance. In May 2019, Applicant was terminated from his employment \nbecause he could not get a clearance. He was unemployed for the next three months \nbefore starting his current job.

(GX \n2; Tr. 30 \u2013 31, 44 \u2013 45) \nIn April 2020, Applicant started working with a credit repair firm to challenge and \nseparate his wife\u2019s financial information from his credit history. During his May 21, 2020, \npersonal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator, he provided information \nabout his monthly finances in which he claimed he was making $730 debt payments, but \nhe did not specify which debts were being paid or how much. That summary of his \nfinances showed he still had a positive monthly remainder of about $1,000. At hearing, \nhe testified that since October 2022, he has paid some of his smaller debts, such as the \nSOR 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g debts, which total less than $100. His testimony about his monthly \nfinances showed he has about $2,000 remaining each month after expenses; however, \nhe also testified that legal fees and other expenses related to his divorce take up most of \nhis remaining money.

(GX 2; Tr. 21 \u2013 22, 27 \u2013 30, 34 \u2013 35, 40 \u2013 45) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nIn response to pre-SOR interrogatories, Applicant established he had resolved his \npast-due tax filings for the 2018 tax year. Nonetheless, the Government met its burden of \nproducing sufficient, reliable information to support the remaining SOR allegations that \nApplicant had accrued significant past due or delinquent debt that is still outstanding. This \ninformation reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is \narticulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe Government\u2019s information supported the SOR allegations and established \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline. In response, it fell to Applicant to produce \nsufficient, reliable information that mitigates the security concerns raised by the \nGovernment. He did not meet his burden. After a thorough review of this record, I \nconclude that none of these mitigating conditions can be applied. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are multiple and recent, in that, his debts have been past due or delinquent for \nalmost ten years in the case of his student loans. Despite the fact he incurred his debts \nthrough circumstances beyond her control, he did not establish that he acted responsibly \nin the face of those circumstances. There is no identifiable documentation of repayment \nor other actions to resolve his debts. Nor is there a record of good-faith effort to resolve \nhis debts, as most of the efforts he discussed have only occurred in the past six months. \nTo his credit, he has used a credit repair firm to address his debts; however, that has not \nproduced results in the form of actual resolution of even some of his debts. On balance, \nI conclude Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion and that he has not mitigated \nthe security concerns established by the Government\u2019s information. \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). The record evidence as a whole presents significant remaining doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Because protection of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nnational interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be \nresolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.aa: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is a high school graduate, and he has earned some \ncollege credits, but not a degree. He served in the military on active duty from 2010 to \n2015 and received an honorable discharge.

(Tr. 41-44; AE A) \nApplicant also disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p owed for an insurance policy that he \ncanceled when the insurer raised his premiums. Applicant believed he was entitled to a \nprorated bill and was instead charged for the entire premium. He disputed the charge on \nhis credit report and provided a copy of it showing his dispute. A report of resolution had \nnot yet been completed. (Tr. 33-34; AE P) \nApplicant provided documentary evidence to show the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e \nthrough 1.g, and 1.i - 1.o are paid, settled, or resolved. Some were resolved in 2021 and \nothers in early 2022. Applicant has a payment plan for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($2,880) to \nmake $100 monthly payments until the debt is resolved. He began making payments in \n2022. His documents reflect the amount to be paid in settlement is $2,380. He testified \nthat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h are duplicate debts. Both are resolved in his favor. (Tr. 25-35, \n40, 44-49; AE B, E-P) \nThe charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($36,165) is for a car loan and the debt in \u00b6 1.d \n($5,957) is a credit card debt. Applicant explained that the car stopped working and he \nfell behind on the payments. He got behind on the credit card when he returned from \noverseas and could not keep up with the payments. He contacted the original creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c and attempted to pay a $5,000 lump sum he had received as a bonus to them, \nbut the creditor would not accept the payment. The creditor advised him it would only \naccept a lump-sum payment for the entire amount to resolve the debt. Applicant was \nunable to pay the full amount. (Tr. 36-39, 44; AE R) \nApplicant testified he had a payment plan with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d. However, \nin his post-hearing submission, he indicated that he was unable to pay the amount owed \non the debt and could not make payment arrangements at the time. He recently contacted \nthe collection companies for both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d and they offered to establish \npayment agreements, but he had to pay a percentage of the total owed before a payment \nplan would be established. Applicant has been paying other debts and is unable to make \nthe percentage payments currently. He intends to continue resolving other debts and then \nwhen they are paid, he will contact the collectors for these accounts and establish \npayment plans to resolve them. (Tr. 40-45; AE R) \nApplicant participated in financial counseling in 2021. He has not opened any new \naccounts and has no new delinquent accounts. He has a written budget that he follows. \nHe is committed to paying the remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. 56-57) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister testified on his behalf.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that he was unable to pay when he \nreturned from an overseas contractor job and his income was reduced. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant still has some delinquent debts that he is paying and others he has not \nresolved, so they remain current and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his reduced income when he returned \nfrom overseas. This was not beyond his control. He should have been aware that his \nsalary would be reduced on his return and established a plan to manage his finances with \nthe reduction in income. However, he has shown sufficient evidence that he has \naddressed many of the delinquent debts that he accumulated, but not all. The evidence \nsupports he has acted responsibly by reducing his spending and paying some creditors. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nApplicant testified that he received financial counseling. He also provided \ndocumentary proof that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e through 1.o were paid, being \npaid, or settled and resolved. He has a payment plan for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. There \nare clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol, and he has made good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c) and \n20(d) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is disputing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.p and he provided a copy of \nhis dispute with the credit bureau. Although the disputes have yet to be resolved, I find \nhe has a reasonable basis for his disputes, and he provided proof he is actively pursuing \nthem. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies. \nApplicant has two large debts that are not paid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). He credibly \ntestified that he intends to repay these debts once he has sufficient funds to pay the \namount the collection companies require to start a payment plan. I believe Applicant \nunderstands that his failure to follow through on this promise could potentially result in \nnegatively affecting his ability to retain a security clearance. He has a repayment plan \nthat he also must complete. He is hopeful his wife will soon be employed, which will \nimprove his finances. Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but he has not ignored his \nobligations. He has made sufficient progress in resolving and addressing the debts in the \nSOR, which reflects positively that he will continue to act responsibly. He has mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

First, he took on the responsibility for his \nfather\u2019s nursing-home care after his mother passed away in 2013. His father was 100% \ndisabled due to a stroke he suffered. Applicant became financially responsible for his \nfather\u2019s nursing home costs and medical expenses not covered by insurance. He was \nnot prepared for the extent of those expenses. He ended up taking money out of his \nretirement plan, which resulted in penalties and led to his large federal tax debt in 2014. \n(Tr. 61-63; SOR answer) \nThe second contributing reason for Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties occurred in \nDecember 2015, when he lost his employment in the UAE due to his company losing \nthe contract with the UAE government. He had accepted a position with a contractor in \nMay 2014. The contractor had a four-year contract with the UAE government, which \nwas the contract for which Applicant was hired. After about 18 months, in December \n2015, the UAE rescinded the contract and Applicant was out of a job. His yearly salary \nat the time was approximately $250,000. He also had relocated his whole family to the \nUAE and was required to leave the country within 30 days because he was no longer on \na work visa. He moved back to the United States, but remained unemployed for \napproximately four months, resulting in an income loss over the period of about \n$80,000. This is when his monthly debts started becoming delinquent. (Tr. 24-25; SOR \nanswer) \nThe third reason for his financial problems came about because of a second \nperiod of extended unemployment beginning in March 2018, due to an unexpected job \nloss. Applicant was let go by his employer over a misunderstanding about being able to \ncharge for labor under the contract when he was working remotely. He had not sought \napproval beforehand to do so and was relieved of his duties. His resulting \nunemployment lasted six months. He received unemployment benefits, but his overall \nloss of income during this period was approximately $60,000. He was forced to use \nsavings to keep up with his bills, but he kept getting further behind. (Tr. 26; GE 1; SOR \nanswer) \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s debts and federal tax return issues is as follows: \nPast-Due Mortgage-$29,466 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant explained that his mortgage \nbecame delinquent in late 2019 or early 2020. He missed some payments because he \nhad children starting college. In February 2020, he sent the bank two catch-up \npayments, but it refused to accept them. The bank told Applicant that he had to apply \nfor a mortgage modification. After ignoring two requests by Applicant, the bank began \nprocessing his loan modification request in the fall of 2021. The process was delayed \nbecause of Covid-19. After extended delays by the bank, Applicant decided to sell the \nhome. The home sold in November 2021, and Applicant documented that the mortgage \nwas paid in December 2021. This debt is resolved.

(Tr. 4; GE 4; \nAE A (Atch C)) \nBank Loan-$103,781 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). This debt originated when Applicant took a \njob in the UAE in 2014. He took out a $200,000 loan to establish his family\u2019s household \nin the UAE and pay for private schooling for his children. The terms of the loan provided \nfor a four-year payback period. When Applicant\u2019s company\u2019s contract was cancelled \nafter approximately 18 months and Applicant was required to leave the UAE within 30 \ndays, this loan became immediately due. Applicant received approximately $42,000 in \nseverance pay when he was terminated because of the lost contract. The bank applied \nthis amount against the loan balance. This is what SOR \u00b6 2.b erroneously referred to as \nan amount \u201cfrozen\u201d by the bank due to the delinquent loan. Initially the bank was \nunwilling to accept a payment plan and demanded payment in full. Thereafter, Applicant \ncommunicated with the bank, and it agreed to accept a payment plan for the loan. He \ndocumented making monthly payments from June through September 2021. When he \nsold his home in 2021, he used some of the sale proceeds to pay off this bank loan in \nthe UAE. He provided documentation showing the payoff. Once the loan was paid, he \nclosed all bank accounts in the UAE. He no longer has any bank accounts in the UAE. \nThis debt is resolved.

I find for Applicant on this allegation. \nFederal Taxes Owed for 2014 and 2018-$54,236 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant \nincurred a large tax debt in 2014 because he withdrew funds from his retirement \naccount to pay for his father\u2019s care, which resulted in an early withdrawal penalty and \ncapital gains taxes. He was unable to pay the taxes when due because he had recently \nlost his job in the UAE. He worked out a payment plan with the IRS and began making \npayments in May 2021. The establishment of the plan was delayed because of \ndifficulties reaching the IRS during Covid-19. When he sold his home in December \n2021, he used some of the proceeds to pay all his remaining IRS debt. He documented \nthat he owes no further federal tax debt, and the tax lien was released.

He did not receive timely tax \ninformation from his former employer, which further delayed being able to file his 2015 \nreturn. He initially sent in his 2015 tax return only to have it returned because of a \nmissing healthcare form (1095-A-C).

(Tr. 51, 53, 77, 80-81; GE 6; AE A (Atch \nG), AE C) \nForeign Influence \nAs explained above, Applicant\u2019s sole connection with the UAE arose because of \nhis 18-month employment within the country. That employment ended in late 2015 and \nApplicant has never returned. When he was employed there, he took out a loan from a \nlocal bank to fund his family\u2019s move to the country, establish a home there, and fund his \nchildren\u2019s schooling. He defaulted on the loan when he lost his job. His severance pay \nwas applied to the loan balance and he paid the remaining amount, initially through \nmonthly payments, and finally by using some of the proceeds from his home sale in \nDecember 2021. He closed all bank accounts in the UAE. He has no current financial or \nfamily connection to the UAE.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe evidence showed Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for \n2015-2018, but 2014 was timely filed. He was also indebted to the IRS in the amount of \napproximately $54,200 for tax years 2014 and 2018. The record also establishes that he \nincurred two delinquent consumer debts, his home mortgage became past due, and he \ndefaulted on a UAE bank loan. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant resolved the consumer debts before the issuance of the SOR. He \nultimately resolved his mortgage by selling his home, but before that he exercised good \nfaith with the lender by sending it makeup payments, which were rejected, then he \nattempted to qualify for a mortgage modification, which the lender was dilatory in \nprocessing. He also resolved his bank loan debt in the UAE, first by making monthly \npayments, and then by using his home-sale proceeds to pay the debt. His untimely and \nunexpected unemployment from his UAE position and expenses related to the care for \nhis father contributed to his financial problems, which were conditions beyond his \ncontrol. Under the circumstances, he acted responsibly by resolving these debts as \nquickly as he was able to do. He also participated in financial counseling which has \nimproved his overall financial picture. \nThere is no doubt that Applicant should have responded in a timelier fashion to \nhis tax problems. However, he has now resolved his federal tax-filing issues and he has \npaid what he owed to the IRS. He filed all his delinquent tax returns before the issuance \nof the SOR. There are clear indications that his financial issues are resolved, he timely \nfiled his 2021 federal tax return, and recurrence is unlikely because he now has a firm \nhandle on his finances and assists his wife with the overall management of their taxes. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(d), and 20(g) are all applicable. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business,\nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result\nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they\ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and\ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with the UAE came about because of his employment in that \ncountry from 2014 until December 2015, when his employer\u2019s contract was terminated\nand he lost his position. In order to fund his family\u2019s household in the UAE for the length\nof his expected employment there, he secured a personal loan from an in-country bank.\nHe ended his employment connection with the UAE in 2015 and repaid the loan in\nMarch 2022. He has no further connections with the UAE, personal or financial.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nI \nconsidered \nApplicant\u2019s \nmilitary \nservice, \nhis \ncontractor \nservice, \nthe \nrecommendations from his coworkers and supervisor, and the circumstances \nsurrounding his delay in filing his tax returns and paying his taxes. I\u2019m convinced he will \nact in a timely manner with his taxes from now on, and that he will not incur tax \nproblems in the future. He also formed a plan to address his delinquent debts and \nexecuted that plan. He is on stable financial ground now and he plans to remain so in \nthe future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns and the \nforeign influence concerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 2.a - 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A complete copy \nof the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was provided to \nApplicant, who received the file on July 7, 2022. (Item 2 at 3.) \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant elected not to file objections to \nthe FORM or to submit any additional information. Accordingly, Items 3 through 7 are \nadmitted into the record without objection. Items 1 and 2, the SOR and the Answer, \nrespectively, are already part of the record. The case was assigned to me on October 3, \n2022. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 33 years old, unmarried, and has four children under the age of 13. \nShe received a high school diploma and attended college classes for five months in 2005. \nApplicant has been employed by defense contractors as a security guard since 2008.

In her \nAnswer, Applicant admitted all but one of the SOR allegations under this guideline. The \nexistence and amounts of these debts are also supported by the credit reports in the \nrecord dated November 17, 2020, and June 17, 2022.

Item 6, Applicant\u2019s June 2022 credit report, details 13 student \nloan accounts opened by Applicant during the 2011 to 2015 period. Applicant defaulted \non repaying the loans in or about April or May 2018, based upon the dates of last activity \nreported in her June 2022 credit report in the record (Item 6). Her e-QIP reflects no college \nclasses during the 2011 to 2015 period. In her background interview, Appellant reported \nthat she defaulted because she was between jobs at the time. The e-QIP does not reflect \nany unemployment in 2019 or thereafter. In her Answer, Applicant stated that her loans \nare on \u201cpause\u201d pursuant to Federal policy, and she intends to set up a payment plan when \nthe pause expires.

This debt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 6 at 9; Item 7 at 8.) \n1.g. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $348. In her Answer, \nApplicant admitted this debt and wrote that she was willing to set up a payment plan. She \nhas not asserted that she has set up a plan or made any payments to the creditor. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Item 2 at 6; Item 7 at 8.) \n1.h. Debt placed for collection in 2016 in the approximate amount of $256. In her \nAnswer, Applicant admitted this debt and wrote that she was willing to set up a payment \nplan. She has not asserted that she has set up a plan or made any payments to the \ncreditor.

Debt charged off in 2017 in the approximate amount of $16,238. Applicant \nopened this vehicle loan account with Bank A in February 2016 and defaulted on her \npayments in March 2017. The account was subsequently charged off. In her Answer \nApplicant admitted this debt and wrote that the creditor repossessed the vehicle. She \nbelieved that the balance after the resale of the vehicle should be lower that than the \nalleged amount of the debt. Nevertheless, she wrote that she was willing to set up a \npayment plan to repay the debt. She has not asserted that she has set up a plan or made \nany payments to the creditor. The Government\u2019s credit reports are somewhat inconsistent \non the status of the debt. The November 2020 report (Item 7) states that the outstanding \nbalance is $16,238, but it also states that the debt was settled for less than the full balance \nof the debt. It further reflects that the charged-off debt was paid. The more recent credit \nreport (Item 6) states that the balance is $0 and that the \u201cAccount Was Paid For Less \nThan Full Balance.\u201d Based upon the information in the credit reports, this debt is resolved. \n(Item 2 at 6; Item 6 at 15; GE 7 at 9.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of her \ncriminal conduct, which raises questions about her judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness; and about her ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. In her Answer, Applicant admitted her recent arrest but noted that the charge \nagainst her was dropped. (Item 2 at 3, 6.) \nThe status of the matters set forth in this paragraph of the SOR is as follows: \n2.a. February 2021 arrest on an arrest warrant for Felony Embezzlement issued in \nOctober 2016. Applicant worked as a cashier at a retail chain in October 2016. Her \nemployer accused her of stealing about $340 from her cash register and filed charges \nwith the police. The theft occurred over a period of about eight days. After the last incident \nApplicant failed to appear for her scheduled work shifts and failed to contact anyone at \nher employer. The local police report in the record, which is included as part of Item 5, \nidentifies in detail the complainant, who was a loss-prevention employee of the store \nwhere Applicant worked, and the three dates and amounts of the cash shortages \ndiscovered in Applicant\u2019s registers. The reporting police officer commented in his report \nthat he obtained a felony warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest from a judge and filed the warrant \n\u201cat the warrant desk.\u201d Applicant was arrested on the warrant in February 2021 during a \nroutine check due to her vehicle being improperly parked. The police department\u2019s Arrest \nReport appears in the record. The only information in the record regarding the disposition \nof the charge is Applicant\u2019s statement in her Answer that the charge was \u201cdropped.\u201d The \narrest occurred after she submitted her e-QIP and her background investigation. The \narrest was reported in a DoD Continuous Evaluation Program report, dated June 17, \n2021.

Applicant omitted requested \ninformation in her response to questions about her financial history. In her Answer \nApplicant wrote that she believed that her debts were outside of the seven-year period \ncovered by the e-QIP questions. \n3.a. Falsification in the e-QIP regarding debts. The relevant e-QIP question asked \nApplicant to disclose bills or debts turned over to collection agencies and accounts and \ncredit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failure to pay as agreed. Both \nquestions were limited to such actions taken in the last seven years, i.e., during the period \nOctober 2013 to October 2020. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to both questions, thereby \nfailing to disclose the debts and accounts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i. \nAll of the defaulted obligations were turned over to a collection agency or charged off for \nfailure to pay as agreed during the period 2016 to 2020. Applicant should have listed all \nof the debts and accounts alleged in the SOR. \nIn her Answer, Applicant wrote that she failed to list her debts because she \nbelieved that they arose more than seven years ago. Her excuse for failing to list her \ndebts is not credible. None of the debts became delinquent more than four years prior to \nthe date she signed the e-QIP and certified that her answers were truthful and correct. \nThe deliberateness of her non-disclosure is also evidenced by her failure to disclose her \ndefaults on her Federal student loans within a year or two prior to the date of her e-QIP. \nWhen given the opportunity to voluntarily disclose her defaults on her student loans during \nher November 2020 background interview, she failed to do so. Applicant even went so \nfar as to not disclose in her e-QIP her post-high school education, which was paid by \nthese 13 student loans accounts opened by Applicant between 2011 and 2015. Her non-\ndisclosure of these college courses is evidence that she was actively seeking to conceal \nher defaults on her student loans. (GE 3 at 2.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed a total of approximately \n$46,000 on 13 past-due Federal student loans and 8 other delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s \ntwo credit reports and her admissions in the Answer establish these facts. Accordingly, \nthe foregoing potentially disqualifying conditions are applicable, and the burden of proof \nshifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by her conduct. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions has been established. The debts are \nrecent and cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. She has \nnot provided any evidence of being unemployed or any other reason for her financial \ndefaults that may have been beyond her control. She has not received counseling and \nhas not produced evidence that her financial problems are under control. With respect to \nher Federal student loans, the Federal Government has extended the moratorium on \nstudent loan payments. Applicant has not, however, provided evidence that she has taken \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsteps to rehabilitate her loans. Her delinquencies on her student loans date back to April \n2018. To the extent that the Federal \u201cpause\u201d policy, which was originally instituted in \nMarch 2020, may apply to student loans that were delinquent prior to the institution of that \npolicy and have not been rehabilitated, the policy does not excuse her past inactions in \nthe context of security clearance eligibility. ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. \n7, 2021). Lastly, she has not made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors. \nApplicant has not met her burden to establish mitigation with evidence of steps taken to \nresolve her delinquent debts and to show her current financial responsibility. Paragraph \n1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant has not explicitly denied or disputed that she committed the crime of \nembezzlement. She wrote in her Answer only that the charges were dropped. To the \nextent that this statement can be interpreted as a dispute of the charge against her, the \nGovernment is obligated to establish the underlying facts regarding Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct. The applicable standard of proof for the Government\u2019s evidence is \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d The Appeal Board has defined the term \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019). This standard is less demanding than the probable cause \nstandard applicable in criminal cases. Id. \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d \nstandard that Applicant engaged in the criminal behavior alleged in the SOR because the \nevidence of embezzlement was found to be credible by both the police officer who filed \nthe charges and by the judge who issued a warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest. Accordingly, \nthe record evidence establishes the above potentially disqualifying condition. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis evidence shifts the burden to Applicant to establish mitigation. AG \u00b6 32 sets \nforth four mitigating conditions under Guideline J. The following three mitigating \nconditions have possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been fully established. The criminal \nconduct occurred in 2016 when Applicant began to experience financial difficulties. Some \ntime has passed since then, but the record contains no evidence that such criminal \nconduct is unlikely to recur. Moreover, the criminal conduct casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. The fact that the prosecutor in Applicant\u2019s case \nmay have dropped the charge against her is not reliable evidence that she did not commit \nthe crime. Prosecutors take such action for any number of reasons unrelated to whether \nthe defendant committed the criminal conduct. See, e.g., CAC Case No. 16-01524 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2018). Lastly, Applicant provided no evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAt the time she prepared the e-QIP, Applicant had delinquent debts. She did not \nreport these debts on her e-QIP; but instead denied their existence by answering, \u201cNo,\u201d \nto the relevant questions. Applicant admitted in her Answer that she was aware of her \ndelinquent debts. She did not credibly explain why she believed they occurred outside the \nscope of the queries, particularly as they remained delinquent at the time she completed \nher e-QIP. The record evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant\u2019s denials and \nomissions of her debts were deliberate. The above disqualifying condition has application \nto this case. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions apply to the facts of this case. Applicant \nfailed to make a prompt good-faith effort to correct the denials and omissions before being \nconfronted with the facts. Her material omissions were significant and her effort to conceal \nfrom the Government that she has many delinquent debts cannot be characterized as a \nminor offense that is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s falsifications cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding her financial considerations, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. \nShe has not minimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. Moreover, she has \nnot shown that there is little likelihood of recurrence of her behavior. Overall, the record \nevidence creates questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICA.NT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 49, married his wife in 2013. He was married to his ex-wife, with whom he has two adult children, from 1996 through 2013. His also has two adult stepchildren, one of whom currently resides with Applicant and his wife. Applicant received his high school diploma in 1991. He attended college in the 1990s for three years without earning a degree. He has been employed as an engineer by a defense contractor since April 2018. He was initially granted a DOD security clearance in about 2006. (GE 1; Tr. at 17, 38-46) Applicant attributed his indebtedness to a \u201ctsunami of unfortunate events\u201d over the period between about 2016 and 2018, when he was either unemployed or underemployed and his wife suffered from complications after sustaining a serious injury. His wife\u2019s injury led to her loss of income and extraordinary medical expenses for which she did not have \u201cvery good\u201d medical insurance to cover. Because she was self-employed, she had to close her business and was not eligible for unemployment compensation. In 2018, she briefly worked part time \u201cto help make money for the family.\u201d However, soon after she began her part-time employment, she had to quit due to ongoing health issues that precluded her from performing the duties required of the position.

He was married to his ex-wife, with \nwhom he has two adult children, from 1996 through 2013. His also has two adult \nstepchildren, one of whom currently resides with Applicant and his wife. Applicant \nreceived his high school diploma in 1991. He attended college in the 1990s for three years \nwithout earning a degree. He has been employed as an engineer by a defense contractor \nsince April 2018. He was initially granted a DOD security clearance in about 2006. (GE \n1; Tr. at 17, 38-46) \nApplicant attributed his indebtedness to a \u201ctsunami of unfortunate events\u201d over the \nperiod between about 2016 and 2018, when he was either unemployed or underemployed \nand his wife suffered from complications after sustaining a serious injury. His wife\u2019s injury \nled to her loss of income and extraordinary medical expenses for which she did not have \n\u201cvery good\u201d medical insurance to cover. Because she was self-employed, she had to \nclose her business and was not eligible for unemployment compensation. In 2018, she \nbriefly worked part time \u201cto help make money for the family.\u201d However, soon after she \nbegan her part-time employment, she had to quit due to ongoing health issues that \nprecluded her from performing the duties required of the position. As of the hearing, his \nwife had made progress in recovering from her injury, but remained unemployed due to \nan ongoing medical condition unrelated to her injury. (Answer; Tr. at 28, 67-69) \nWhile working on the same DOD contract from about 2006 through December \n2013, Applicant\u2019s salary increased from about $151,000 to $160,000. In 2013, he decided \nnot to continue working on that contract because it was acquired by an employer with a \nbad reputation. Instead, he found employment with another defense contractor from \nDecember 2013 through April 2014, earning a salary that was not indicated in the record. \nHe then was employed by a defense contractor to work on another government agency \n(AGA 1) contract from April 2014 through about February or March 2016, earning an \nannual salary of $220,000. During his time with AGA 1, his DOD security clearance had \nbeen archived, which he did not realize until he was searching for a new employer. \n(Answer; Tr. at 29-38) \nApplicant remained unemployed through November 2016, when he found an \nemployer willing to sponsor him for a clearance.

While waiting \nfor his clearance to be reinstated, he worked on a contract for another government agency \n(AGA 2) from November 2016 through April 2018, earning an annual salary of $121,000, \nwhich he described as \u201ca very significant cut in pay.\u201d His AGA 2 salary was insufficient to \nmeet expenses that were strained by the loss of his wife\u2019s income, increased \ntransportation expenses due to a longer commute to work, and the $3,000 per month he \ncontinued to pay his ex-wife for alimony and child support. He never missed a support \npayment to his ex-wife, which ended in 2020 when his youngest child turned 20. \nAttempting to stay current with his financial obligations, he relied on credit cards and \ndepleted his \u201clife savings\u201d of over $20,000. Eventually, he fell behind and incurred \ndelinquent debts, including those alleged in the SOR. He began earning an annual salary \nof $151,000 upon being hired by his current employer in April 2018. That salary increased \nover time to $181,000 in about February or March 2022. (Answer; GE 5 at 1; Tr. at 18, \n29-38, 44, 103-104) \nOn July 28, 2020, after he completed his SCA, Applicant was interviewed by an \ninvestigator who confronted him with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, about which he had no prior \nknowledge. On August 5, 2020, after completing his own investigation of those debts, \nApplicant followed up with the investigator to provide the information he learned about \nthem and to profess his intent to pay both debts. He then worked with his wife to develop \na budget and a plan to address their finances. At the hearing, he explained that process: \nI took the credit report, and we started reviewing everything at that point. \nWe \u2013 my wife keeps a running folder of what our accounts are, what the \nbills are, and she also has a notebook of what's due and what the budget \nplan is to pay all these items down, and that's where we kind of did a \nreconciliation of what's what, what needs to be refocused as I started \nmaking more money, and also as things are paid off, taking that money that \nwas, let's say, applied to a car payment that is now paid off, we can take \nthat, let's say, $600 and apply that somewhere else to another bill and pay \ndown faster. (GE 5, Tr. at 48-49) \nIn August 2020, Applicant resolved an unalleged credit card account that had been \ncharged off (for the same reasons described above) in the approximate amount of \n$10,195. He made $600 monthly payments towards the $10,195 debt which reduced the \nremaining balance to $1,095 as of July 2020.

They fell behind in their monthly payments for the \nreasons described above. In April 2021, he paid the debt in full via one lump-sum payment \nusing a portion of a $15,000 gift he received from his mother.

His stepson only attended about one and a \nhalf semesters before disenrolling due to poor performance. Initially, the loan was \ndeferred because his stepson planned to reenroll in a local community college. Then, it \nwas deferred due to COVID-19. When the deferral ended, the loan fell into arrears \nbecause his son was unable to obtain employment due to COVID-19. Prior to his \nNovember 2021 CBR, he made some payments that reduced the remaining balance to \n$20,331. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he continued to make payments further \nreducing the remaining balance to $5,082. After the hearing, he proffered documentary \nevidence to corroborate that he consistently paid $339 per month from November 2021 \nthrough January 2023.

(AE B, G) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro.

(ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has made meaningful progress in addressing the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b have been resolved. Although not yet resolved, \nApplicant initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay SOR \u00b6 1.c. He acted \nresponsibly to address his indebtedness in light of circumstances that were beyond his \ncontrol. He has demonstrated a track record of responsible action that leads me to \nconclude that he will follow through with his plan to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.c. The AGs do not \nrequire an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each debt alleged in the SOR, or to be \ndebt free. Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems and has made \nsubstantial progress implementing his plan. Given the responsible manner in which \nApplicant has addressed his delinquent debts, I conclude that his finances are under \ncontrol, unlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nthe debts alleged in the SOR.

From about 1989 until May 2017, he was employed by another government agency (AGA) in various cleared positions. He was terminated from the AGA in May 2017, and his clearance was revoked soon thereafter, following his arrest and guilty plea for the conduct that is largely the subject of this case.

Though the offenses are dated, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the resulting security concerns, \nalleged under Guideline E (personal conduct) and cross-alleged under Guideline J \n(criminal conduct). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 5, 2019, in \nconnection with his employment in the defense industry. (GE 1) On June 28, 2021, the \nDepartment of Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct). The CAF issued the \nSOR under Executive Order (Exec.

On December 17, 2021, his counsel submitted a related brief (Answer) \naccompanied by exhibits. (Answer Tabs A through E, all of which were resubmitted as \nhearing exhibits.) The case was assigned to me on October 5, 2022. On November 3, \n2022, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be held in person on \nDecember 8, 2022. \nOn December 7, 2022, the day before the hearing, Department Counsel filed a \nmotion to amend the SOR, seeking to add as a cross-allegation under Guideline J (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a), the same conduct alleged under Guideline E \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The basis for the \namendment was a new theory of the case, rather than on new evidence. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel objected to the untimeliness of the motion, noting that his theory in defense was \nbased, in large part, on the fact that the Government had not alleged a Guideline J case \nagainst his client, and that he had prepared his case accordingly. Were Guideline J to \nbe included in the SOR, he would likely request a continuance in order to have \nadditional time to brief the case and gather additional relevant evidence. The December \n7 e-mails between the parties are marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I and the SOR \nAmendment is HE II. \nDuring a conference call that afternoon, I heard brief arguments from counsel, \nafter which I denied the Government\u2019s motion to add the Guideline J cross-allegation as \nuntimely, given the ample opportunities available to the Government to add it earlier. \nThe December 8 hearing was, therefore, to proceed as scheduled. (The conference call \nis summarized at Tr. 7-9) \nLater that same evening, I was injured in an accident at home. As a result, I was \nmedically unable to attend or conduct the in-person hearing scheduled for the next day. \nOn the morning of December 8, I continued the hearing indefinitely, notifying the parties \nby phone. With the hearing continued, Department Counsel promptly renewed her \nmotion to amend the SOR. (HE II, III) \nOn December 19, 2022, I held another conference call with the parties. I granted \nthe renewed motion to amend the SOR, since Applicant now had sufficient time to \nrespond, with no hearing date yet rescheduled. Applicant was given until January 19, \n2023, to answer the added cross-allegation. This was memorialized in a December 19, \n2022 e-mail. (HE IV) Applicant\u2019s counsel filed a timely Answer to the Amendment and a \nlegal brief. (HE V) . \nThe hearing was then rescheduled for February 24, 2023, to occur virtually \nthrough the Microsoft TEAMS platform, by mutual agreement. DOHA issued a hearing \nnotice on January 30, 2023. On February 17, 2023, Applicant\u2019s counsel requested an \nin-person hearing instead of one by TEAMS.

Department Counsel \nsubmitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A, B, C, D-1 \nthrough D-10, and E, all of which were admitted without objection. (AE A is a power of \nattorney and AE B is the SOR). \nI left the record open to enable Applicant to submit additional documentation. He \nsubsequently submitted documents that were marked as AE F and AE G (a letter and \npayment ledger related to his restitution payments) and admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 7, 2023. The record closed on \nMarch 27, 2023. \nAmendment to the SOR \nIn her Amendment to the SOR, Department Counsel added a cross-allegation \nunder Guideline J (criminal conduct) as follows: \n2.a: \nThat information set forth in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, above. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was submitted by counsel. In a signed \ndeclaration (AE C), Applicant addressed the Guideline E allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d), \neach with narrative explanations. (Tr. 70-71) His answers do not contain the phrases \n\u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny.\u201d I nonetheless construe his answers as admissions to most of the \nfactual circumstances alleged, but otherwise take his explanations as denials. I construe \nhis answer to SOR \u00b6 1.c (concerning falsification) as a denial. Through counsel, \nApplicant admitted the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, the exhibits, and the hearing testimony, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree, and \nother certifications. He was married from 1992-2014 and he remarried in January 2021. \nHe has three grown children. From about 1989 until May 2017, he was employed by \nanother government agency (AGA) in various cleared positions. He was terminated \nfrom the AGA in May 2017, and his clearance was revoked soon thereafter, following \nhis arrest and guilty plea for the conduct that is largely the subject of this case. He has \nbeen employed in the defense industry, with the same employer, since May 2017, and \nhe seeks a security clearance through that employment. He does not hold a clearance \ncurrently. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 29-38; 71-72, 92-98, 133-136) He also works a side job as a \ncity housing inspector, on a case-by-case basis, after hours.

Players were required to perform \ncommunity service and keep up good grades. He became close friends with F, a \nwoman whose son was in the program, and whom he had known for many years. They \nhad social contact, but were not dating. She was a city employee. (Tr. 52-53, 64-67, 72\u00ad\n81; GE 2 at 4) \nApplicant\u2019s friend F had two mortgages on her home from Bank S. By 2009, F \nwas behind on her mortgage payments, and in May 2010, a notice of foreclosure had \nbeen filed with the city Recorder of Deeds. In spring 2013, Bank S began foreclosure \nproceedings. (GE 9 at 4; Tr. 109) Through their friendship, Applicant \u201coffered to give her \nsome advice\u201d about selling her home, based on his own experience with a short sale in \nabout 2012-13. (Tr. 52-53, 64-67, 72-81) \nIn October 2013, Applicant allegedly created and then filed fabricated certificates \nof satisfaction with the city Recorder of Deeds for the two liens on F\u2019s home. With the \nliens apparently satisfied, F would own her home \u201cfree and clear\u201d with no amount due \non any outstanding mortgage. F then put her home up for sale. When the house was \nsold, she received 100% of the proceeds from the sale, of about $337,000 \u2013 proceeds \nthat should have gone to Bank S to satisfy the outstanding mortgages. After the sale \nwas completed in December 2013, F split the proceeds with Applicant, who received \nabout $170,000 days later, apparently as a loan, rather than as a gift. He quickly \ndeposited the money into his bank account. (GE 4, GE 9; Tr. 85-86, 109-110) \nIn 2015, Applicant allegedly made a materially false statement on a financial \ndisclosure form that he submitted to his government employer, when he failed to \ndisclose the $170,000 gift or loan from F as required. (GE 9) \nFederal law enforcement authorities opened an investigation into the transaction. \nIn March 2016, Applicant was interviewed as part of their investigation. He denied \npreparing fraudulent certificates of satisfaction, denied knowing what the term \n\u201ccertificates of satisfaction\u201d meant, and denied other activities by which Bank S was \nallegedly defrauded. (GE 4) He denied, for instance, going to the city Recorder of \nDeeds to file the fraudulent certificates of satisfaction, and he denied that the certificates \ncontained his handwriting. (Tr. 84, 92, 141-142) \nIn August 2016, Applicant was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with \nmultiple felony counts, including Conspiracy, Bank Fraud, Wire Fraud, Money \nLaundering, False Statements, and Uttering a Forged Instrument. He was arrested days \nlater.

He was placed \non administrative leave after he was indicted (August 2016) and in May 2017, following \nhis guilty plea, he was terminated from his job. He testified that he tendered a \nresignation, but was then terminated days before his resignation was effective. (GE 1, \nGE 4; Tr. 81, 93-98) (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nApplicant reported the charges, guilty pleas, and sentence on his August 2019 \nSCA. He also noted that he was still on supervised release (though he hoped for early \ntermination). (GE 1 at 32-34) He disclosed that he had been terminated from his job at \nthe AGA, and that his clearance had been revoked as a result. (GE 1 at 16, 37-38) \nIn the Employment section of his SCA, Applicant indicated that he had worked for \nhis current employer since May 2017. (GE 1 at 14; Tr. 98-99) In listing his residences, \nhe disclosed residing at an \u201cFPC\u201d (Federal Prison Camp) in State 1 from August 2017 to \nJanuary 2018. (GE 1 at 10; Tr. 57, 99-104) \nApplicant testified that when he was questioned by law enforcement authorities, \nhe said this was the first he had heard about a \u201ccertificate of satisfaction.\u201d He said the \nauthorities built a case against his friend (F). (Tr. 50, 55) He said a key part of the \nevidence against him was an address listed on the certificates. This was an address he \nhad access to, but he said he had not been there in seven years. That residence was \nowned by a friend of his. He denied at hearing that he knew what that address was. (Tr. \n56, 84-85, 88-89) At his hearing, he denied creating or receiving phony certificates of \nsatisfaction of the liens and asserted he would have been exonerated at trial. (Tr. 82-85, \n138) \nApplicant said he did not want to plead guilty and accept the plea agreement, but \nonly did so with the strong urging of his defense counsel. (AE C) This was confirmed by \na letter from his defense counsel, Mr. B. (AE D-9) Applicant acknowledged that before \npleading guilty, he was provided a copy of the indictment, the Statement of Offense, and \na letter from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office detailing the terms of the plea agreement. (GE 7, \nGE 8, GE 9; Tr. 139-140) He acknowledged stipulating to the Statement of Offense and \nsigning it under penalty of perjury. (Tr. 83, 111-112) GE 8 contains the following \nstatement, under \u201cDefendant\u2019s Acceptance:\u201d \u201cI am pleading guilty because I am, in fact, \nguilty of the offenses identified in this agreement.\u201d By his signature, he also indicated \nthat he had read and understood the entire plea agreement and was entering into it \n\u201cvoluntarily and of my own free will, intending to be legally bound.\u201d (GE 8 at 12) \nAt his security clearance hearing, Applicant said, \u201cI understand that, you know, \nalthough I, you know, was talked into it, that Statement of Offense that I signed in 2017 \nwill always be the record, the official record. And so, going forward, I will acknowledge \nthat as such. . . .\u201d (Tr. 43, 47, 139-140) However, he also asserted that he always \nintended to go to trial and expected to be found not guilty. \u201cAnd, I, to this day, believe in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmy innocence.\u201d (Tr. 44, 110-111, 140) He acknowledged pleading guilty to two of the six \ncounts. (Tr. 50; AE C) \nApplicant also said he accepted responsibility and acknowledged signing the \nStatement of Offense. (Tr. 91-92) He asserted that he was advised by his attorneys \nthat, even if he pleaded guilty, he was likely to be able to keep his job with the AGA and \nhis clearance. (Tr. 45) (The plea agreement letter does not address this.) (GE 8) He \nalso asserted that he was told that one of the charges (money laundering) carried a \nmandatory sentence. He was also concerned for his family and the things in life for \nwhich he was responsible. In the end, \u201cit took a lot to convince me. I took the plea deal.\u201d \n(Tr. 56-57) \nApplicant acknowledged that the Statement of Offense, which he signed, \nincludes an admission that he filed false certificates of satisfaction with the city recorder \nof deeds. (GE 9 at 4) It also states that he \u201ccaused the creation\u201d of the two \u201cphony\u201d \ncertificates. (GE 9 at 4) He acknowledged that F therefore received proceeds from the \nsale that should have gone to Bank S. He acknowledged that the $50,000 loan he \nreceived from F was part of those proceeds and was part of the $170,000 he received. \nHe believes he was not credited with paying that $50,000 back to her, so it should not \nbe part of the restitution. (Tr. 128-131, 138; AE C) \nApplicant also acknowledged that he appeared in federal court, with his counsel, \nbefore the judge who took and accepted his plea, and was questioned extensively about \nwhether he was pleading guilty knowingly and voluntarily, accepting responsibility for \nwhat he did, and with an understanding of the possible punitive consequences. (GE 8 at \n12) He asserted at hearing that he believed he would not get any jail time. He also \nacknowledged that he did not, at least formally, pursue an attempt to withdraw his guilty \nplea. (Tr. 112-118) He asserted that he pled guilty because he was scared, and never \nbeen in trouble before and trusted his attorneys, and \u201cI did what they advised me to do.\u201d \n(Tr. 138-139) The plea agreement letter noted an \u201cEstimated Guidelines Range\u201d for a \nsentence of 24 to 30 months in jail. (GE 8 at 3) \nApplicant testified at the security clearance hearing that he recognized that \ndenying responsibility for the conduct yet also pleading guilty and admitting to the \nconduct in the Statement of Offense is a \u201ccatch-22,\u201d and he does not wish to appear \ndeceptive. (Tr. 61, 91, 110-112, 140) \nApplicant was allowed to \u201cself-surrender\u201d to begin his prison sentence. (Tr. 50) \nHe testified that he did not have to leave his job as a contractor when he reported to \nfederal prison. He said he was on administrative leave while he was in prison. (Tr. 51) \n(It is unclear what, if anything, Applicant told his employer where he was going). \nApplicant\u2019s sentence of one year and one day was reduced due to good behavior \nto about four months in jail. He was released in early January 2018.

He participated in all the required rehabilitative training. (Tr. 58-59, 99-104) His \nperiod of supervised release also ended early, in January 2020. (GE 10; AE E) \nApplicant explained that of the $170,000 in proceeds he received from the sale of \nF\u2019s house, $120,000 went to the NPO basketball team. He said the money went \nprimarily for travel expenses, such as hotels and airline tickets. He used $35,000 for \nhimself (\u201cfor what I wanted.\u201d). He said he later received $50,000 from an uncle\u2019s estate \nwhen his uncle died in about 2014. Applicant said authorities also seized his bank \naccount and kept the funds (about $48,000). (Tr. 53-54, 73, 128-129) \nApplicant asked F for a $50,000 loan in 2013, around the time her house was \nsold. He said he used the money to help his children. He said he repaid the loan in \n2014. (Tr. 127-128; GE 2 at 4) He testified that he did not report the matter on his 2015 \nfinancial disclosure form because he paid it off the year before, and that most of the \nmoney went towards the basketball program, and not to him. (Tr. 89-90, 131-133) The \nStatement of Offense says he deposited the $170,000 into his own bank account. (GE 9 \nat 5) He acknowledged that it was \u201cprobably not\u201d a good idea to ask F for a loan if he \nknew she had credit or financial problems. (Tr. 137-138) \nIn October 2019, Applicant had a background interview in connection with his \nSCA. In SOR \u00b6 1.c, the Government alleges that Applicant made deliberately false \nstatements to the investigator when, in discussing his criminal charges, he asserted that \nhe did not engage in the underlying criminal conduct, despite having pled guilty and \nhaving signed a \u201cStatement of Offense\u201d in which he acknowledged various specific \ncriminal acts. (GE 2 at 5; GE 9) \nApplicant denies the allegation of falsification. He acknowledges \u201cmisstatements\u201d \nthat \u201cdid not correspond or correlate with the Statement of Offense\u201d that he had signed \nin 2017 on the advice of counsel. (AE C; AE D-10; Tr. 38, 61, 90-91, 121-123) He said, \nhowever, that these \u201cmisstatements\u201d were not \u201cfalse statements.\u201d (Tr. 46, 125-126) He \nsaid he did not intend to mislead the government and apologized. (Tr. 40, 46; AE C) \nApplicant also testified that he consulted legal counsel, Mr. D, before meeting \nwith the interviewing agent \u201cbecause I wanted to get guidance on . . . how I should \napproach the questions as they pertain to the incident that transpired in 2013\u201d and to \n\u201cadd to the record\u201d on the matter. (Tr. 41-42. 46; AE C) \nThe lawyer Applicant consulted, Mr. D, met Applicant days before his interview \nwith the investigator. Mr. D wrote, in part: \nWith [Applicant\u2019s] understanding that the statement his attorneys had him \nsign in the 2017 plea agreement would always be the official record, I \nadvised him to tell the DCSA investigator the truth as he knew it and \nthough it would differ from the official record, it would serve as a \nmechanism to get his account of the events that transpired in the Fall of \n2013 in the record.

(AE D-10) \nApplicant did not believe that either he or the interviewing agent (Agent B) had a \ncopy of the Statement of Offense or the Plea Agreement Letter when he had the \ninterview. He adopted the interview summary as accurate in an interrogatory response, \nand only provided an update as to the status of his supervised release. (GE 2 at 8-9; Tr. \n126-127) \nGE 4 indicates that Applicant has been ordered to pay about $337,000 in \nrestitution. He testified that he and F are jointly and severally liable for the full amount, \nbut then said he is responsible only for the $170,000 he received. He is still trying to \nsettle what he owes in restitution but is also making $150 payments regularly on a \nmonthly basis and is current, as of March 1, 2023. Court documentation reflects that he \nis jointly and severally liable for the full amount ($337,105). Almost $105,000 has been \ncollected since 2017, with about $232,000 outstanding. Several line items are blacked \nout, so they may relate to payments by F (though this is unclear).

(Tr. 60; AE D-4, AE D-5, AE D-7, AE D-8) He is no longer involved \nwith the NPO\u2019s basketball program and has not been involved since he was indicted. \n(Tr. 77-78) \nApplicant has had no other arrests or offenses. He had no security violations \nwhen he held a clearance.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. (AG) In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother single guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . any \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; [and] a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations; \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nDepartment Counsel acknowledged that SOR \u00b6 1.a (the charges in the \nindictment) and SOR \u00b6 1.b (the guilty plea and sentence) relate to the same \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncircumstances. (Tr. 145) I will therefore treat them together as a single allegation (and \nthey are cross-alleged as such under Guideline J.) (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nIn 2013, Applicant engaged in a scheme with his friend F to defraud her \nmortgage bank, Bank S, and take the proceeds of the sale of her house \u2013 proceeds that \nrightfully should have gone to Bank S when the home was sold. As he acknowledged \nwhen he affirmed the Statement of Offense and accepted the plea agreement, he had a \nhand in creating two phony certificates of satisfaction for the mortgage liens, filed them \nwith the city Recorder of Deeds, and accepted his share of the proceeds when the sale \nwas completed by depositing the money into his bank account. He also failed to declare \nthose proceeds on his government financial disclosure form in 2015, as required. Even \nnow, Applicant does not want to acknowledge the specifics of what he did, but as even \nhe acknowledges, the record speaks for itself. \nApplicant was indicted, charged, arrested, pled guilty to two of the charges \n(having received legal advice to do so), was sentenced to federal prison, served his \nsentence, and completed his probation (supervised release). He is still paying on the \nseveral hundred thousand dollars in restitution and will be doing so for a long time. \nThe Appeal Board has held that a plea of guilty is an admission not only of the \nfacts underlying the offenses but of the crime itself. ISCR Case No. 11-06937 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2013) However, even though the doctrine of collateral estoppel may \napply to a criminal conviction, Applicant must also be given an opportunity to explain his \nconduct, present it in a meaningful context, and ultimately have an opportunity to \nmitigate it. ISCR Case No. 11-00180 at 7 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2012) \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is implicated by Applicant\u2019s conduct, particularly since he was \nterminated from his job with the AGA as a result. AG \u00b6 16(g) also applies. The general \npersonal conduct security concern (AG \u00b6 15) is also implicated, given Applicant\u2019s poor \njudgment and dishonesty shown by his involvement in the criminal scheme. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) does not apply. There is now a cross-allegation under Guideline J, so \nit cannot be said that his conduct is \u201cnot explicitly covered under any other single \nguideline.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 1.d sets forth the consequences of the conduct (the termination by the \nAGA), rather than the conduct itself (the criminal conduct to which he pled guilty). Thus \nSOR \u00b6 1.d does not constitute disqualifying conduct, since it concerns the AGA\u2019s action \nagainst Applicant, rather that something he did. \nThis leaves SOR \u00b6 1.c. The Government alleges that Applicant engaged in \ndeliberate falsification in denying in his background interview that he engaged in \ncriminal conduct, notwithstanding his guilty plea and acceptance of the Statement of \nOffense detailing what he did, in various specific respects. Applicant denies the \nallegation of deliberate falsification. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed the offense on his SCA, disclosed the subsequent \ntermination and revocation of his clearance, and disclosed that he was still on probation. \nHe also sought legal advice about what to say during the interview, and believed he was \nacting in accordance with that advice at the time. (See mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(b)). \nIt is definitely true that Applicant has had (and continues to have) difficulty accepting full \nresponsibility and acknowledging that he committed any crimes, either generally or \nspecifically. But as to SOR \u00b6 1.c, I conclude that, while he did not accept full \nresponsibility for his criminal conduct, he also did not intend to give false information in \nhis interview. AG \u00b6 16(b) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nI will address the mitigating conditions under Guidelines E and J together, below. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct:  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of the two criminal conduct allegations in SOR \u00b6 \n1 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The security concerns associated with that conduct are largely \naddressed under Guideline E above. Nevertheless, AG \u00b6 31(b) also applies. \nApplicant is still paying restitution and will continue to do so for a long time. \nHowever, he completed his jail term and his period of supervised release and did so \nearly. Thus, AG \u00b6 31(c) (individual is currently on parole or probation) does not apply. \nThe potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E are set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nThe potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline J are set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence that the individual committed the offense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSome mitigation does attach here given the age of the criminal conduct at issue, \nand the fact that Applicant has no other instances of criminal conduct. He pled guilty, \nserved his sentence, and was released early, both from jail and from supervised \nrelease. The conduct occurred about 10 years ago. \nHowever, this was not a single act of poor judgment or lack of impulse control. \nThis was a scheme, one that required planning and malice aforethought, and several \nsteps to accomplish it. At each one of those steps, Applicant could have pulled back \nand decided not to proceed. He did not do that. Further, he held a clearance at the time \nas a longtime, trusted, cleared U.S. Government employee. Put simply, he should have \nknown better. \nFurther, the mitigating effect of the age of the conduct is undercut by Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued insistence that he didn\u2019t do it and that he would have been found not guilty at \ntrial. He pleaded guilty to the two charges and did so with considered advice from legal \ncounsel. He professed to be surprised that he went to jail at all \u2013 when he received less \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthan the recommended term of 24 to 30 months. He claims not to have been involved \neither with the creation of the phony certificates of satisfaction or with filing them with \nthe city, contrary to the specifics of the Statement of Offense, which he acknowledged, \naccepted voluntarily, and signed. He asserted that the basketball team got $120,000 of \nthe money he received, when the evidence says he deposited it into his own bank \naccount. These assertions undercut his acceptance of responsibility for his actions. \nThey undercut a showing that he is fully rehabilitated. And they undercut his credibility \nsince he professes innocence that I simply do not believe. \nEven though I have concluded that Applicant did not make a deliberately false \nstatement in his background interview in claiming not to have engaged in criminal \nconduct, I also conclude that he has never accepted full, unequivocal, unconditional \nresponsibility for what he did \u2013 and for what he pled guilty to. This lack of acceptance of \nresponsibility significantly undercuts any claim of rehabilitation, even ten years on. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 32(a) have some application due to the age of the offenses, but \nthey do not fully apply. The seriousness of the offenses and the fact that he has not \naccepted full responsibility leads me to conclude that his actions continue to cast doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 17(d) has some application, but this is undercut by the fact that \nApplicant has not fully acknowledged his behavior. AG \u00b6 17(g) applies, since Applicant \nhas no further contact with his friend F. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(f) and 32(c) do not apply, as the information is not unsubstantiated, \nand there is reliable information that Applicant committed the offenses to which he pled \nguilty. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies, as Applicant disclosed the offenses on his SCA, and the \ndated nature of the offenses (and the fact that he plead guilty to them in open court) \nmake the possibility of exploitation rather unlikely. \nLastly, AG \u00b6 32(d) is given some consideration. Applicant served his sentence, \ncompleted probation (both early) and has an excellent work record, and a long \ninvolvement in community outreach, as shown by his strong professional character \nreferences. He has no other criminal offenses. Despite the age of the offenses, \nhowever, their serious nature, the fact that he engaged in the conduct while employed in \na cleared position while employed with the U.S. Government, and the fact that he has \nnot accepted full responsibility for his actions precludes full consideration of mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and J in my whole-person analysis. On balance, and in \nconsideration of the evidence as a whole, I conclude that Applicant provided insufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns about his personal conduct and criminal \nconduct. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information.
