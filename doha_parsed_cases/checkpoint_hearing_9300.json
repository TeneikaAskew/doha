Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n\n2\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is unfair because the Judge relied on an\ninvestigative file prepared by persons who did not believe Applicant.  Applicant contends that\nmitigating evidence was not considered, and questions were not posed of the investigative body\nregarding possible weaknesses in the (unfavorable) theory of the case.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe Judge found that Applicant participated in a scheme to exploit her status at a military\nexchange overseas to purchase exchange merchandise for foreign nationals ineligible to make such\npurchases.  He further found that her denials were not credible and constituted the deliberate\nprovision of false information to her employers and the investigators.  The Judge\u2019s adverse findings\nwere based on substantial evidence and are sustainable.  (See Directive \u00b6E3.1.14 and \u00b6E3.1.32.1.)\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the evidence and the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct\nand considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  The Judge reasonably\nexplained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo. Furthermore,  Applicant has not provided a\ncogent reason on appeal to disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  Applicant\u2019s argument on\nappeal about questions the Judge could have asked is unpersuasive.  Applicant elected to have her\ndecision on the written record.  Thus, there was no mechanism for the Judge to ask questions.  Also,\nthe burden is on Applicant to make her case in mitigation, rebuttal or extenuation, not on the Judge\nwho is an impartial adjudicator.  (See Directive \u00b6E3.1.10, \u00b6E3.1.15 and\u00b6 E3.1.25.)\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn December 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nIn an undated answer to the SOR that was received on January 22, 2009, \nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on February 23, 2009. The \nFORM was received by Applicant on March 2, 2009. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not object to the FORM and submitted additional material on March 26, \n2009. Department Counsel did not object to the additional material and it was admitted. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 22, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except 1.q. The Government \nmoved to strike allegations 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p, as being duplicates of 1.c and 1.d. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and other evidence submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in 1997 \nand divorced in 2002. He remarried in 2005. He has two children, ages 11 and 10, and \ntwo stepchildren, ages 15 and 12.  \n \n \nApplicant has more than $19,000 in delinquent debts. In his response to the \nFORM he stated that his financial problems were the result of low paying jobs, lay-offs, \nand an injury. He also stated that during \u201cthis time\u201d he was a single father trying to get \nby. Applicant did not provide detailed information as to the specifics of his financial \nsituation during the \u201ctime frame.\u201d He also did not provide any information about the \nspecifics of an injury or its impact on his financial situation. \n \n \nApplicant explained he was working one full-time and one part-time job during a \nperiod of time and then just one full-time job. He did not explain why he no longer \nworked the part-time job. He stated his wife was going to school and the plan was that \nwhen she graduated and got a job she would help with the finances. She could not find \na job in her field. Applicant failed to provide the time frame that she went to school. He \nfailed to provide information as to whether his wife got a job in another field. He failed to \nprovide information as to what responsible actions he was taking regarding his finances \nduring this time. He did state he contacted some creditors to make payment \narrangements, but was unable to keep up with the payments. He did not explain which \ncreditors he contacted and what specific payments he made towards his debts.  \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM Applicant stated he recently paid off some of his \ndebts and made arrangements with others. He failed to explain why he waited until \nMarch 2009 to take any action on debts that had been delinquent for many years. He \nexplained he received money from family to resolve some of his debts. No information \nwas provided as to whether this money was a gift or a loan that is to be repaid.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owed all of the debts in the SOR except the debt in 1.q \n($130) that he disputes. In his response to the FORM he stated this debt was to his \nchiropractor with whom he had worked out a plan with whereby he would receive the \nchiropractor\u2019s services and as payment Applicant would clean and detail the \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nchiropractor\u2019s cars. He provided a copy of a letter he sent to the creditor on March 16, \n2009, disputing the account and a witness statement verifying the arrangement. The \nlast activity reported on this account on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR) is April \n2004. It does not appear any other action was taken to resolve the account.1 \n \n \nApplicant provided a document verifying that the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($1,167) \nwas paid on March 13, 2009. The date of the judgment was November 2007.  \n \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d ($86, $45, $414, and $402, \nrespectively) are medical debts. Applicant\u2019s stated in his response that he received \nmoney from his family to pay these debts. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d have been \ndelinquent since 2003. The debt in \u00b61.a has been delinquent since 2005 and the debt in \n\u00b61.b has been delinquent since 2006.2  \n \n \nApplicant provided a credit card receipt for $3,506 paid to the collection company \nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.l, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t. (These debts total $3,542.) It is \nunclear if Applicant used this credit card to pay all of these debts. He did not provide \ninformation as to the payment status of this credit card debt. He stated in his answer \nthat he paid all of these debts to this collection company from money he received from a \nfamily member. He provided receipts that the debt in SOR \u00b61.l is paid and four medical \ndebts totaling $1,558 are paid; all as of March 13, 2009.3 \n \n \nApplicant owes approximately $15,456 in delinquent student loans that he took \nout in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The credit reports list the last activity on any of the \naccounts was in 2002. Applicant failed to provide any information for why he failed to \nmake payments on his student loans in the past seven years. He stated in his answer to \nthe FORM that he enrolled in a student loan rehabilitation program to bring his loans out \nof default and into good standing. He provided an unsigned one page document \ndetailing the rehabilitation agreement. He did not provide any proof he has started to \nmake payments into the program.  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.m ($95) is to a video rental store. Applicant stated in the \nFORM that he contacted the creditor and could not reach an agreement on monthly \npayments. He does not have the money to pay the debt in full, but plans on sending the \ncreditor $25 a month. He did not provide proof he has begun paying the creditor. The \ndebt has been delinquent since 2004. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n \n1 Response to FORM; GE 3 and 5 at page 12.  \n \n2 GE 5, 6 and 7. \n \n3 Response to FORM. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG &19 especially the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts dating back to at least 2002. He made some \npayments to resolve some of his debts in the past few weeks, but still owes a \nsubstantial amount of money. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions. I especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant provided proof that some of his delinquent debts were paid in March \n2009. It is unclear if he used a credit card to pay these debts and what the status of the \ncredit card debt is. He stated he received money from a family member to pay some \ndebts, but it is unknown if that money is a loan to be repaid. Applicant still has debts that \nhave not been resolved and therefore mitigating condition (a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nThere is some information that the conditions that resulted in the Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems were beyond his control due to a divorce and injury. However, \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient information regarding the specifics of what \nhappened and how he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Based on the facts \nincluded in the FORM I am unable to apply mitigating condition (b).  \n \n \nThere was no evidence in the FORM that Applicant received financial counseling. \nThere is some evidence that Applicant is getting his finances under control, but without \nspecific information about his current financial situation I can not apply mitigating \ncondition (c).  \n \n \nApplicant has had debts that have been delinquent for many years. It appears he \ndid not take any action on resolving these debts until his security clearance became an \nissue. He provided some proof he paid some of his debts in March 2009. These are \ndebts that have been delinquent for years. He stated he has entered a rehabilitation \nprogram to pay his delinquent student loans, but did not provide a signed agreement or \nproof he has made any payments. I find under the circumstances mitigating condition \n(d) partially applies. I am concerned that the debts Applicant has paid have been by \ncredit card and from money received from a family member. It is unclear if he has \nincurred new debts to pay the old ones.  \n \n \nApplicant disputes one debt stating he had an agreement to provide work for \nservices to his chiropractor. Applicant provided a letter he wrote to dispute the debt on \nMarch 18, 2009. The debt has been delinquent since April 2004. No other information \nwas provided. I find mitigating condition (e) applies to that debt.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were \nyears old before he paid some of them. He did not take action on them until his security \nclearance was an issue. It is unclear if he has incurred new debts to pay his old debts \nand if he has the financial means to pay the new debts. He stated he entered a \nrehabilitation program to repay his student loans, but did not provide proof that he \nsigned the agreement or has made any payments on it. Without a substantial period of \nconsistent payments toward this large debt it is too early to determine that Applicant is \ncommitted to staying financially solvent and consistently pay his bills on time. I do not \nhave any evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial status and his current ability to pay his bills. \nHe provided very little information about why he failed to make payments on his student \nloans for seven years. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.m: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.t: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Cervi, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nThis is a security clearance case in which Applicant contests the Defense\nDepartment\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense\nindustry. The record shows Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties as\nshown by a defaulted student loan with an approximate balance of $77,237. Applicant\nhas not paid, settled, or otherwise resolved this debt, and he does not have a realistic\nplan in place to do so. In addition, he might have other delinquent student loan debt.\nThese circumstances create doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nThe record contains insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security\nconcerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nNovember 30, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit 1. \n2\n Exhibit 1. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on January 26, 2009. The SOR is similar to a complaint as it detailed the\nfactual basis for the action under Guideline F for financial considerations. Also, the SOR\nrecommended submitting the case to an administrative judge for a determination\nwhether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me August 5, 2009. The hearing took place September 23,\n2009. The record was left open until October 7, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit\ndocumentary evidence as he submitted none at the hearing. Applicant made a timely\nsubmission, which consists of a one-page handwritten letter. It is marked and admitted,\nwithout objections, as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. The transcript (Tr.) was received October 1,\n2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked as a\npart-time mail clerk, working about 20 hours per week, since April 2008. His duties as a\nmail clerk may require him to handle and safeguard classified information. His full-time\njob is as a stocker or sales associate for a large, well-known retail store. He has held\nthat job since 2002. It appears that this is Applicant\u2019s initial application for an industrial\nsecurity clearance.  \n2\nApplicant\u2019s educational background includes completing high school. He also\nattended two or three different colleges, but he did not complete the requirements for a\ndegree. His employment history includes less than one year of service in the U.S. Air\nForce. He enlisted in 1982, and he received an entry-level separation in 1983.  He\n3\nmarried for the first time in 2005, and he has no children. His wife is not employed\noutside the home.  \n\n Exhibits 2 and 3. \n4\n Tr. 74\u201376. \n5\n Exhibit A. \n6\n Tr. 81. \n7\n Tr. 77\u201378. \n8\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n9\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties as shown by\ndelinquent accounts in credit reports from 2008 and 2009.  The SOR alleged two\n4\ndelinquent accounts. The first is a medical debt for $1,123 that is now in collection.\nApplicant believes this debt stems from medical treatment he received for a work-\nrelated injury at the store in 2008. \nThe second debt is a defaulted student loan for $77,237. The credit reports\nindicate that a claim has been filed against the guarantor of the loan. The defaulted\nstudent loan stems from money Applicant obtained to attend a school of graphic art and\ncartooning in about 1990\u20131991. In addition, Applicant believes he might owe another\n$80,000 in student loan debt for another college (institute of art) he attended.  That debt\n5\nis not reflected in the credit reports or otherwise established by the documentary\nevidence; also, it is not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant has not presented any documentary proof of payment, settlement, or\notherwise resolving the debts. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that he\ncontacted the creditors, but the proposed terms of monthly payments are more than he\ncan afford.6\nApplicant and his wife budget their money on a week-to-week basis, and he\ndescribes their overall financial situation as living paycheck-to-paycheck.  Applicant is\n7\nwilling to pay these debts, but he agrees he is unable to do so.8\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n9\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\n\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n10\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n11\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n12\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n18\n4\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n10\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n11\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n12\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n13\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n14\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n15\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n16\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.17\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.18\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n19\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n21\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n22\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n23\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n24\n5\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n19\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n20\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n21\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record here shows Applicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back\nseveral years. His well-established history of financial difficulties raises concerns\nbecause it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not\n22\nmeeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are more\n23\nthan sufficient to establish the two disqualifying conditions, and they suggest financial\nirresponsibility as well.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are certain conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns:  \n24\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\n\n6\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none, either individually\nor in combination, are sufficient to mitigate and overcome the security concerns\nstemming from the defaulted student loan with a balance of more than $75,000. With\nthat said, however, I attach no security significance to the single medical debt for $1,123\nthat is now in collection. Experience in the ways of the world suggests that medical debt\nrarely indicates if the debtor is a high risk because (1) many people are uninsured or\nunderinsured, (2) medical-debt collection has become big business with the buying and\nselling of debt resulting in more of it appearing in credit reports, and (3) confusion often\nabounds in medical billing even when a consumer is fully covered by insurance. For\nthese reasons, the single medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is decided for Applicant. \nApplicant does receive some credit in mitigation under the whole-person concept.\nIt is obvious that Applicant is a hard worker who would be willing to pay his just debts if\nhe had the means to do so. He has held down two jobs, working approximately 60\nhours per week, since April 2008. That is no small feat and Applicant is credited\naccordingly. In addition, Applicant was respectful and serious throughout the hearing,\nand that attitude will serve him well as he endeavors to repay his debts. \n  \nBut that credit is not enough to overcome the security concerns stemming from\nthe defaulted student loan. Delinquent student loans, much like delinquent state and\nfederal income taxes and delinquent child-support payments, are viewed with particular\ndisfavor and take on added security significance in light of the nature of the obligation.\nFurther, what is missing here is a plan of action to pay, settle, or otherwise resolve the\ndefaulted student loan. Without a realistic plan and some measurable progress, it is too\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n25\n7\nearly to tell if he will resolve this situation favorably. Looking forward, the likelihood of\nadditional financial problems cannot be ruled out as the situation is not under control.     \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s defaulted\nstudent loan create doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He did\nnot present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns.\nIn reaching this conclusion, I considered the nine-factor whole-person concept  and\n25\nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion\nto obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 9, 2008.\nOn November 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nMarch 23, 2009\n\nThe State statute of limitations for open accounts is three years (A..C. 6-2-37) and for sale of goods under\n1\nthe Uniform Commercial Code is four years (A.C. 7-2-725).\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 21, 2008. (Item 3) She\nsubmitted a notarized, written response to the SOR allegations dated December 8,\n2008, and requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 4)\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on January 27, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nFebruary 3, 2009. She had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She timely submitted a written\nresponse which was received on March 5, 2009. DOHA assigned this case to me on\nMarch 12, 2009. The government submitted seven exhibits, which have been marked\nas Items 1-7 and admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been\nmarked and admitted as Item 4. Her response to the FORM is admitted into evidence.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 8, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.u of the SOR, with explanations. (Item 4) She\nalso provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Id.\nApplicant, who is 36 years old, works as technical writer for a Department of\nDefense contractor. She has held this full time job since May 2008. She graduated from\ncollege with a Bachelor of Arts degree in December 2007. (Item 5.)\nApplicant married her first husband in June 1994 and they divorced in November\n1999. She has a 13 year-old son from this marriage, who lives with his father. She\nmarried her second husband in July 2005. They recently divorced. They have a two\nyear-old son, who lives with Applicant. Applicant also has two step-children, ages 15\nand 11. Applicant does not receive any financial support from her estranged husband.\n(Items 4 and 5; Response to FORM)\nApplicant enrolled in college in 1999. Over the next eight years, she worked part-\ntime and attended school either part-time or full-time. Many jobs did not pay a living\nwage. In May 2005, while a student, doctors diagnosed Applicant with an incurable, life-\nthreatening illness. She did not have medical insurance and incurred significant medical\nbills as she began medical treatment. Through her medical treatment, her illness is\nbeing medically managed. She will require medical treatment for the rest of her life.\n(Item 5; Response to FORM)\nThe record indicates numerous unpaid debts, totaling more than $55,000. These\ndebts accrued over the last seven years. Many unpaid debts are medical bills, totaling\n$8,825. Six of the debts are five years or more older.  These old debts total $7,482,\n1\nincluding $1,536 in medical bills. The October 9, 2008 credit report shows that a car\n\n3\nowned by Applicant and her second husband was repossessed. In her response to the\nSOR, Applicant acknowledges that she still owes $22,850 on this debt. In light of\nApplicant\u2019s admission, I find that this is the amount owed on the debt listed in allegation\n1.n. (Items 1, 4, 6, 7)\nIn December 2008, Applicant retained a credit counseling service. This company\nindicates that it will help her develop a budget and resolve her old debts, including\neliminating debts which are not hers. (Item 4) In her response to the FORM, Applicant\nadvises that she now has a budget and a repayment plan. She also states that she is in\nthe process of contacting her creditors and in a forbearance plan on her education debt.\n(Item 4; Response to FORM) She has not provided a copy of her budget, her letters to\ncreditors, her repayment plan, her forbearance plan, or evidence of payments made.\nThe record does not contain any evidence which shows Applicant\u2019s current earnings\nand current expenses.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt over the last seven\nyears that remains unpaid. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ As Applicant=s\ndebts are recent this potentially mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\n\n5\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from her serious medical problems, her recent\ndivorce, and periods of under employment or unemployment. These factors are beyond\nApplicant\u2019s control. For this mitigating condition to fully apply, Applicant must establish\nthat she acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. The record lacks\nsubstantial evidence that Applicant is resolving these debts. I find this mitigating\ncondition has partial applicability. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant retained a credit counseling service, which indicated\nthe services it will provide. Applicant advises that she has a budget and repayment plan\nfor her debts, but has not provided any documentary evidence that her debts are in a\npayment plan and her finances are under control. Likewise, she has not provided any\ndocumentary evidence that she is making payments under her payment plan and on her\neducation debt. The record lacks evidence that her debts are being resolved and that\nshe is financially sound. I conclude that these potentially mitigating conditions have\nminimal application in this case. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not\napplicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both good\nand bad. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record, not\na single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is shown. A determination of\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for\nspecific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of\n\n6\nrecord to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security\nconcern. \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant accumulated debt partly\ndue to circumstances beyond her control, including health problems, sporadic\nemployment, under employment, and her divorce. (See AG & 2(a)(2).) Since her debts\ncontinue to accumulate, Applicant has not demonstrated a significant change in her\nfinancial management. \nWhile six of her debts are barred from collection under the statute of limitations,\nshe has many newer debts that she has not paid. She recently sought help from a credit\ncounseling service with managing her numerous and voluminous debts. She is just\nbeginning the process of rehabilitating her credit and her finances. She has not yet\ndemonstrated a track record of compliance with the payment plan she has developed\nand compliance with her budget. Given the current status of her debts and the lack of\nevidence that she has started to resolve her debts, a security concern exists. Her\ncurrent debt levels are significant. As the record lacks evidence showing Applicant\u2019s\nefforts to manage her finances, she has not established mitigation. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her finances. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.o:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nNovember 30, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant provided his answer to the SOR on March 27, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on June 3, 2009 for a hearing on June 23, 2009. The hearing was held\nas scheduled. At the hearing, three exhibits (GE I through 3) were admitted in evidence\nwithout objection to support the government's case. Applicant testified and submitted\nnine exhibits (AE A through AE I). The record remained open until July 1, 2009, to allow\nApplicant to submit additional evidence. He submitted seven additional exhibits (AE J\nthrough AE P) within the time allowed to submit post hearing exhibits. The exhibits\nreflect payment receipts showing that certain unlisted debts were completely paid or\npayments were made. DOHA received the transcript on July 7, 2009. The record closed\non July 7, 2009.\nRulings on Procedure\nUnder E3.1.8. of the Directive, an applicant must be notified at least 15 days in\nadvance of the time and place of the hearing. Applicant believed he may have received\nthe hearing notice on June 10, 2009 (Tr. 5), but was certain of a telephone conversation\nhe had with Department Counsel on May 22, 2009, where he agreed to have the\nhearing on June 23, 2009 (Tr. 7). After subtracting May 22, 2009 (when Applicant\nagreed by telephone to the hearing date) from June 23, 2009 (hearing date), I find\nApplicant was notified of the date of the hearing more than 32 days in advance.\nAccordingly, I conclude the government complied with the 15-day notice requirement of\nE3.1.8. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the five delinquent debts listed in the SOR. Applicant is 55\nyears old and has been married since January 1982. He has three children from his\ncurrent marriage and two daughters from a previous marriage. He has been employed\nas an assistant professor of military science since 1997. \nApplicant enrolled in college in 1972 and was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nEnglish in 1976 (Tr. 34). When he could not find a job, he entered the United States\nArmy in 1977 as a noncommissioned officer. In approximately 1986, he applied for and\nwas accepted into Officers Candidate School (OCS) (Id.). Upon completion of OCS, he\ncontinued serving in the Army as a commissioned officer until he retired in 1997; at the\nrank of captain. He seeks a security clearance. \nSOR 1.a. alleges a delinquent medical account amounting to $55. This debt was\nlisted on a November 6, 2008, credit report as delinquent (GE 3). Applicant referred to\nAE I (credit report dated June 2009) and claimed the debt was paid, though AE I\nshowed the debt belonging to a different creditor. Applicant testified that the holder of\nthe account appearing in the SOR was different from the holder appearing in AE I (Tr.\n49-50). Though he stated he had documentation to verify the account was paid (Tr. 54),\nno supplementary information was provided. \n\n He became pastor of the church in 1999 (AE G, first character statement).\n1\n3\nSOR 1.b. is a delinquent student loan account for $246. Applicant obtained this\nloan and the one described in SOR 1.c. to help his two sons pay college tuition (Tr. 52,\n54). He indicated the student loan account was deferred for a year by his wife in March\n2009. Their plan is to resume payments on the account in March 2010 (Tr. 50-51). The\ndeferment was granted because of the loss of income of Applicant\u2019s wife (Tr. 56). AE I\n(credit report dated June 19, 2009) lists this account in deferment. AE O, furnished by\nApplicant to verify both accounts are in deferment, provides different account numbers\nfrom the numbers appearing in AE I. Before SOR 1.b. and 1.c. were placed in\ndeferment in March 2009, they had become delinquent in February 2008 (GE 2).\nSOR 1.c. lists a delinquent student loan account for $535. This loan is also in\ndeferment as verified by AE I. As noted under SOR 1.b., Applicant applied for and\nreceived the two student loans in the 1980s to enable his sons to attend college (Tr. 52,\n54). The sons were not able to keep full-time jobs and Applicant is not confidant they\nwill be able to repay the loans (Tr. 55-56). As noted under SOR 1.b., Applicant plans to\nresume payments on both loans in March 2010.\nSOR 1.d. describes a delinquent account placed in collection in September 2007\nfor approximately $9,308. In August 2002, Applicant cosigned for his daughter\u2019 car so\nshe would have transportation to get to and from work (Tr. 37). For a time, the daughter\nmaintained the payments, but then defaulted in about September 2007, as indicated by\nthe credit report (GE 2). Applicant worked out a repayment plan in March 2009, with the\ncollection agency requiring an immediate $1,000 payment and then regular payments of\n$200 a month (AE E). He claims he paid $1,000 on this account. The only\ndocumentation of payment of this account is a $200 payment in June 2009, to the\ncollection agency in SOR 1.d. (AE C).\nSOR 1.e. is a second installment loan account for approximately $11,134.\nApplicant cosigned for his second daughter\u2019s car so she would have transportation\nbetween home and work (Tr. 37). Applicant worked out an agreement with this creditor\n(no documentary support) in March 2009 to pay $1,000 immediately and $250 a month.\nHowever, AE D reflects a payment of $1,000 to the SOR 1.e. creditor. Applicant claims\nhe is making payments of $220 a month on this account. AE A does not substantiate a\npayment was made, but does inform Applicant when the next $200 payment is due.\nHaving weighed the four exhibits pertaining to SOR 1.d. and 1.e., I find Applicant has\nestablished a payment plan with both creditors and is paying on the plans. \nIn approximately February 2002, one of Applicant\u2019s daughters was living with a\nman who was selling drugs and other paraphernalia (Tr. 59). Applicant was on his way\nto his church  when he received a telephone call recommending he pick up his five\n1\ngrandchildren, ages 8 to 14, from his daughter\u2019s house, rather than have the state\nfamily services organization place the children in foster care (Tr. 58-59). Though\nApplicant did not specifically indicate the reason for the removal of the children, the\ncourt order (March 5, 2003) providing him long term-custody of the grandchildren,\n\n The only delinquent accounts appearing in GE 3 are the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR, and one\n2\ncredit card account that is 60 days past due. \n4\nindicates that his daughter had not complied with a family services case plan (AE F). As\na Relative Care Giver, Applicant has been receiving $1,200 from the state family\nservices organization (Tr. 61). Had his grandchildren not been related to him, the foster\ncare support would have been about four times greater than the $1,200 figure (Id.). \nApplicant earns about $8,400 a month from military retirement, his professor\u2019s\nposition, and his church position (Tr. 62). His wife earns about $4,000 a month as a\nnurse, though her earnings plunged to about $1,400 a month in the last 12 months\nbecause of the national economy and fewer vacationers visiting the area (Tr. 32). \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage is $3,800 (Tr. 29). Because the mortgage is also\ndelinquent, Applicant and his wife are trying to sell the house through a short sale (Tr.\n27). They were also approved for a loan modification, but have not been furnished the\nrequirements for the modification (Id.).\nApplicant had financial counseling several years ago, and learned the importance\nof paying his bills on time (Tr. 79). Applicant has a budget and conducts budgetary\nmeetings with his wife (Tr. 80-81). While his wife makes most of the financial decisions\nsince she is better at handling the finances, Applicant is determined to take a more\nactive role in the financial decisions because two financial managers are better than one\n(Tr. 81-83). \nApplicant is current on his federal and state taxes (Tr. 67). Applicant received\napproximately an $8,000 tax refund from his 2008 taxes. After eliminating some car\ndebt (Tr. 67-68) (no additional information provided), Applicant satisfied or paid on 9 of\n10 delinquent debts between March and June 23, 2009. He provided receipts showing\nhe paid $3,546 in satisfaction of five delinquent accounts (AE K through AE N, and AE\nP).  As a result of paying off delinquent accounts, Applicant\u2019s net monthly remainder is\n2\ncurrently about $1,500 (Tr. 82-83).\nCharacter Evidence\nWitness A testified that he was an instructor with Applicant between 1994 and\n1997 at the university where Applicant still teaches (Tr. 20-21). Witness A rated\nApplicant\u2019s job performance as outstanding (Tr. 22). Since his return to the area in\n2001, Witness A has joined Applicant\u2019s church. He has become a deacon (Tr. 19) and a\nclose friend based on their shared desire of helping people (Tr. 23). Witness A is aware\nApplicant owes for a car and is trying is trying to eliminate the debt (Tr. 23-24). \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that one of the two cars identified in SOR 1.d. and 1.e.\nwas repossessed, and the other was damaged and returned before the lease ended (Tr.\n29). Applicant\u2019s wife also testified that she and Applicant purchased their home in 2006,\nand began paying a mortgage of $3,800 a month. Because of the depressed state of\n\n5\nthe economy in the last year caused fewer vacationers to visit the area (Tr. 32-33), his\nwife\u2019s earnings dramatically decreased and the mortgage became delinquent (Tr. 27).\nApplicant furnished five character statements (AE G). The first endorsement is\nfrom the mayor of the city where Applicant lives. According to the mayor, Applicant has\nbeen active in community affairs for the past 15 years. He has been the pastor of one of\nthe city\u2019s churches where he has administered several youth programs for the past 10\nyears. \nThe second reference comes from a professor at the school where Applicant is\nemployed. He commended Applicant for the latter\u2019s devotion to duty and detail (Id.). The\nprofessor considers Applicant a real leader. \nThe third character statement is from Witness A\u2019s wife. She has known Applicant\nfor 15 years and is a member of his church. She believes he has earned a sterling\nreputation in the community because of his activities in the church and his devotion to\nhis family, specifically his five grandchildren (Id.). \nThe fourth character endorsement is from a state judge of nearby county. The\njudge commented favorably on Applicant\u2019s honesty and dedication to the community.\nThe judge found Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to be unparalleled (Id.). \nThe fifth character statement was written by a pastor from another church in the\ncity where Applicant resides. The pastor believes Applicant is an effective minister who\nis well respected by his congregation (Id.).\nOn June 19, 2009, Applicant received an award from the university where he\nteaches. The award congratulated him for making significant contributions to the goal of\ndeveloping future leaders fo the military (AE H). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on common sense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" Finally, the Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nParagraph 18 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) sets forth the security concern\nrelated to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\n\n7\nThe financial guideline lists two disqualifying conditions that may be applicable to\nthis case:\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of failing to meet financial obligations).\nApplicant has approximately $21,000 in delinquent debt for a medical account,\nstudent loans, and two cars. He is unable to pay the delinquent accounts. Before the\nstudent loans (SOR 1.b. and 1.c.) were deferred, they had become delinquent in\nFebruary 2008. The installment loans (SOR 1.d. and 1.e.) became delinquent in 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay the debts make AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) applicable.\nThe financial guideline identifies four mitigating conditions that may apply to the\ncase:\nAG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment); and \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control, and the person acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances); and\nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control); and\nAG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough the debts became delinquent only recently, I sincerely doubt the\ncircumstances will recur because Applicant comprehends how his altruism has\ndamaged his finances. He will think carefully before he applies his name in a co-\nsignature capacity. Applicant receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) based on the\nresounding character evidence about his trustworthiness, and the positive impact he\nhas had in his community for about 15 years.  \nApplicant is entitled to considerable mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Having a family\nof 5 in February 2002 suddenly double to a family of 10 was clearly an unanticipated\nevent that Applicant was not ready to handle immediately. Suddenly having to assume\nthe payments on two student loans and two car installment loans in the last two years\nhas clearly complicated Applicant\u2019s financial responsibilities. However, Applicant has\nprovided persuasive evidence that he is acting responsibly under the circumstances to\ntackle these debts. In March 2009, his wife was able to defer payments on the loans.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s plan is to resume payments in March 2010. Regarding the two cars that\nwere returned to the dealers, Applicant has provided satisfactory evidence he has paid\n$1,000 to each creditor, and is paying between $200 and $220 a month on both\ndelinquent accounts. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies.\nApplicant has received financial counseling and meets with his wife regularly to\naddress the debts. Applicant has convinced me that he is going to take a more active\nrole in his finances. AG \u00b6 19(c) applies as there are clear indications the delinquent\ndebts are being resolved. Applicant\u2019s documentation showing payments to the SOR 1.d.\nand 1.e. creditors, together with his documented evidence of paying off five of nine\nunlisted creditors entitles Applicant to mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). The mitigation\nApplicant receives under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) overcomes the negative\nevidence under financial considerations guideline. \nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThough Applicant is ultimately responsible for all five debts listed in the SOR, his\nfinancial problems were caused by his commendable decision to do the right thing for\nhis daughter and her five children in February 2002. Though he could have simply\nallowed his five grandchildren to be placed in the state\u2019s foster care program, he felt\nmorally obligated to help his daughter and her children by keeping them in the family.\nThis kind of willingness to help others is the primary reason Witness A became\nApplicant\u2019s close friend. I sincerely doubt that he was immediately ready to absorb the\nadded expense of raising five additional children between the ages of 8 and 14.\nHowever, it appears he has made the appropriate adjustments. \nWhen Applicant cosigned for his daughters\u2019 two cars, he wanted to make sure\nhis daughters had adequate transportation. Rather than avoid his secondary liability for\nboth cars, he demonstrated financial responsibility by working out a plan with both\ncreditors, and is making payments under the plan. \n\n9\nApplicant has had financial counseling, but understands he must participate more\nin the financial affairs of his household. I am confidant he will show the attention to his\nfinancial obligations as he has shown in his teaching position at the university, where he\nrecently received an award for outstanding service. After careful consideration of the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the context of the whole person concept, I\nconclude Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under the financial considerations\nguideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and E for Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 17, 2008.

However, in July of 2001, he again filed for the protection of\nBankruptcy (Id, and AppX L).  He was eventually discharged of his debts in February of\n2005 (Id).  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor P for an outstanding\njudgement in the amount of about $833.  This debt was included in Applicant\u2019s\nBankruptcy petition and was discharged, as evidenced by Applicant\u2019s Bankruptcy\ndocumentation (TR at page 42 line 19 to page 43 line 8, and AppX L).\n1.q. and 1.z.

I find the Applicant successfully disputed this debt.\n1.s.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor S in the amount of\nabout $7,625 (GX 6 at page 3).  The Applicant disputes this debt (TR at page 44 line 8\nto page 45 line 3).  This was the voluntary repossession of a truck, towards which he\navers he owes nothing further (Id).  His on-line law firm notes this account as being in\ndispute since \u201c04/16/07\u201d (AppX I at page 3).  I find this debt to be in dispute.\n1.t. and 1.u.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor T for two\ndebts, one for about $275 and the other for $1,760.  The Applicant disputes these\nphone bills, and his on-line law firm notes the smaller debt is \u201cunder review,\u201d and the\nlarger debt as being in dispute since \u201c06/13/07\u201d (TR at page 45 line 6 to page 47 line 3,\nand AppX I at page 2).  These debts do not appear on the Government\u2019s most recent\nFebruary 2009 CR (See GX 6).  I find these debts to be in dispute.\n1.v.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor V in the amount of\nabout $420.  The Applicant denies this debt, and it does not appear on the\nGovernment\u2019s most recent February 2009 CR (TR at page 47 lines 4~8, and See GX 6).\nI find the Applicant does not owe this debt.\n1.w. and 1.x.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor W for two\ndebts totaling about $488.  The Applicant disputes these debts as having been \u201cpaid,\u201d\nand his on-line law firm notes that these debts have been \u201cdeleted\u201d (TR at page 47 lines\n11~21, and AppX I at page 2).  These debts do not appear on the Government\u2019s most\nrecent February 2009 CR (See GX 6).  I find the Applicant successfully disputed these\ndebts.\n1.y.  Lastly, it is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor Y in the amount\nof about $320.  The Applicant dispute this debt as having been paid (TR at page 47 line\n24 to page 48 line 14).  This debt does not appear on the Government\u2019s most recent\nFebruary 2009 CR (See GX 6).  I find the Applicant successfully disputed ths debt.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nIn answer to Sections 28.a. and 28.b. on his May 2008 e-QIP, the Applicant\nfailed to disclose his delinquent debts in excess of 90 and 180 days (GX 3 at pages\n26~27).  The Applicant testified, credibly, that he was in hurry to complete the e-QIP,\nand had no intention to withhold information from the Government (TR at 56 line 2 to\npage 59 line 8).  His character is attested to by those who know the Applicant in the\nworkplace (AppXs G and H, see also AppXs B~F).  I find this not to be a wilful\nfalsification.\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\nsome obligations for a period of time.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Under AG & 20(d) where the evidence\nshows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,@ may be mitigating.  Here, the Applicant has a positive monthly cash flow\nof about $700.  I have given the Applicant the benefit of the doubt as to the numerous\ndebts that are still in dispute; and despite the undersigned giving the Applicant more\nthan two months to address his remaining past due debts, his debts to creditors B, C\nand O remain outstanding.  These are not insignificant debts, but total in excess of over\n$2,000.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nI find no disqualifying conditions applicable in this case, as Applicant\u2019s omissions\nin answering Sections 28.a. and 28.b. were not \u201cdeliberate\u201d as required under AG &\n26(a).  I find no willful falsification.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his Financial Considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.a.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 23, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 10, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 11, 2009. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on March 5, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. The Government also offered Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I as a demonstrative exhibit. There was no objection and it was considered. \nApplicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through F. Department Counsel did not \nobject and they were admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nMarch 23, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 2.b, and 2.c. He \ndenied the remaining allegations and did not respond to 1.p. His admissions to the \nallegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 53-year old budget analyst who has worked for a federal contractor \nsince August 2008. He has a college degree in business education and also earned an \naccounting certificate.1  \n \nApplicant is married, but has been separated from his wife since July 2005. He \nhas a ten-year-old son. He pays $842 a month in child support. The child support order \nwas not implemented until November 2005 and Applicant was required to pay back \nsupport from July 2005. Therefore, an additional $100 for the arrearage was added to \nhis monthly payment. At the time of the order, Applicant was earning approximately \n$70,000 a year. In December 2005 Applicant lost his job and was employed as a \n\u201ctemporary employee\u201d until August 2008. He would be employed in short term contracts \nand was only paid while under contract. When the contract expired he would not be paid \nand would have to wait to be assigned to another contract. His temporary employment \nstatus reduced his annual income. He did not have benefits, including health insurance, \nduring the period of temporary employment. He could not pay all of his child support \nduring this time and got further behind. When he was working full-time he paid the full \namount of child support. He has experienced periods of unemployment. Applicant \nstated he has approximately $1,800 remaining to pay in arrearages. He did not provide \ndocumentation to support this amount. He stated he has been saving his expendable \nincome each month and hopes to pay $1,000 toward this debt in the near future. The \nSOR 1.n. alleges his arrearages are $4,000. The documentation that Applicant provided \nshows he has arrearages of approximately $4,000.2 \n \nApplicant has a medical condition and the prescribed medication costs \napproximately $300-$400 a month. When he did not have health benefits he was \nrequired to pay this from his income. He estimated his out of pocket medical expenses \nduring this period were approximately $4,000. Since starting work with his new \nemployer he has health insurance and his prescriptions are covered.3  \n \n1 Tr. 29. \n \n2 Tr. 28, 41-54; AE D and F. \n \n3 Tr. 35-41. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe debt in SOR 1.a is to a jewelry store ($2,160). Applicant purchased a \ndiamond bracelet in 2006 or 2007. He made a partial payment in cash and put the \nremaining amount on his credit card. He can not recall how much the original price was. \nHe still has the bracelet. He made some payments and then stopped. He has not paid \nthis debt.4 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.b is a medical debt ($422). He stated in his answer to the \nSOR that he was working on paying it. It is owed to his doctor. He is trying to work out a \npayment schedule, but has not made any payments toward this debt.5 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.c is a medical debt ($374). Applicant thought his mother paid \nthis debt. It was incurred when he did not have health insurance. He found out his \nmother did not pay it. He has not paid this debt.6 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.d is a cell phone debt ($279). Applicant terminated the \ncontract, but believed he did not owe a termination fee. He spoke to the creditor and \nthey were to credit him an amount. They did not credit an amount. He has not spoken to \nthe creditor since before he received the SOR and has not followed-up on the debt.7 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.e is a medical account debt ($197). Applicant stated he paid \nthe debt, but did not provide proof of payment.8  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.f is a medical debt ($151) that Applicant thought he had paid, \nbut did not. He has not paid the debt.9 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.g is a credit card debt ($4,868) that Applicant plans to pay in \nthe future. Part of the amount of the debt was incurred by Applicant and part by his wife. \nThe credit card is in Applicant\u2019s name. He could not recall when he stopped making \npayments on the debt, but remembered he had the credit card before he separated from \nhis wife. He has not contacted the creditor recently.10 \n \nThe debts in SOR 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k ($116, $893, $692, $90) are all to a bank \nwhere Applicant used to have accounts. When he failed to make complete child support \npayments, his bank accounts were levied, thereby causing overdrafts on his savings \n \n4 Tr. 55-57. \n \n5 Tr. 57-58. \n \n6 Tr. 58-59. \n \n7 Tr. 59-61. \n \n8 Tr. 61-64. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Tr. 64-67. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nand checking accounts. The amounts reflect overdraft fees and overdrafts. He has not \ntaken any action to resolve the accounts. He stated \u201cI just don\u2019t know where to begin.\u201d \nHe no longer has active accounts with this bank.11 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.l is for medical services ($50). Applicant stated he paid this \ndebt and does not know why it is on his credit report. He tried to contact the creditor. He \nstated he learned the creditor went out of business.12  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.m is a judgment for medical services ($169). Applicant does \nnot remember what services were incurred. Applicant stated he attempted to contract \nthe creditor, but because he could not find a copy of the bill he could not contact the \ncreditor. He admitted he did not look in the telephone book, or on the internet, or review \nthe credit report which provides a contact number. He stated he intends on contacting \nthe creditor in the future.13  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.o ($6,549) Applicant believes is the same debt as in 1.g. He \ndid not provide any credible evidence or documentation to support his position. He \nnever contacted the creditor to confirm the debt or see if it was a duplicate. He also did \nnot contact the creditor in SOR 1.g. 14  \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.p is a student loan debt ($3,704). He stopped making \npayments on his student loan sometime in 2006. He was offered a settlement by the \nloan company on February 12, 2009 to pay $1,894 in 30 days to resolve the debt. \nApplicant stated he will pay that amount this week. He testified he would use the money \nhe saved to pay the debt. When questioned about his statement that he was going to \nmake a lump sum payment of $1,000 toward his child support, he admitted he had not \nconsidered that payment.15 \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.q is a credit card debt ($14,000). He incurred this debt prior to \nseparating from his wife. He stated he agreed to allow his wife to put some of her \nmother\u2019s medical debts on the credit card. He stopped making payments on the credit \ncard around 2006. He can not recall when he last contacted the creditor. In his answer \nto the SOR he stated he would make arrangements to pay the debt. He has not taken \nany action on the debt.16  \n \n \n11 Tr. 67-71. \n \n12 Tr. 71. \n \n13 Tr. 71-74. \n \n14 Tr. 75-78. \n \n15 Tr. 78-81. \n \n16 Tr. 85-91. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe debt in SOR 1.r is for a repossessed car ($14,686) Applicant purchased in \nOctober 2005. He stopped making payments in January or February 2006. The loan \nwas for five years. He was unfamiliar with how the financing worked and realized most \nof his monthly payments were applied to the interest and not principal of the debt. He \nreturned the car to the dealer and was told he would be contacted when it was \nauctioned. He stated he has not heard from the creditor.17  \n \nApplicant has not had financial counseling recently. He and his wife attended \nsome financial counseling in 2000 or 2001, but learned that the counselors were trying \nto sell them something.18  \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d on his security clearance application (SCA) to sections \n27 and 28, which inquired if he had any judgments against him in the last 7 years that \nhad not been paid; if in the past 7 years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s); and if he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s).  \n \nApplicant has more than $53,000 in delinquent debts. Applicant testified he did \nnot know he was 180 days or 90 days delinquent on his debts. Applicant explained \nwhen he completed the SCA he was embarrassed he had debts, but did not realize how \nold the debts were when he answered \u201cno.\u201d He stated he should have said \u201cyes\u201d and he \nnever meant to mislead. He also failed to list he had a car repossessed. He stated the \nreason he did not list the repossession was because he failed to read the whole \nquestion.19  \n \nApplicant admitted he was contacted by collection companies about some of his \ndebts. He told them he wanted to \u201cmake good on the debts.\u201d He also received calls from \ncollection companies after he was separated from his wife in approximately early 2006. \nHe also received inquires by telephone and by mail.20  \n \nI find Applicant deliberately and intentionally failed to list his delinquent debts and \njudgment. He did not contact the investigator prior to his interview and divulge his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nApplicant does not intend to file bankruptcy and wants to pay his delinquent \ndebts. He stated he is applying for a security clearance not a credit card and he does \nnot believe he is a security risk.21 \n \n \n17 Tr. 91-96. \n \n18 Tr. 105. \n \n19 Tr. 105. \n \n20 Tr. 96-99, 108-109. \n \n21 Tr. 110-111. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nA team member from Applicant\u2019s office who has worked with him for eleven \nmonths provided a statement that he is an essential member of their team. He has \ndemonstrated the utmost professionalism and has repeatedly proved himself as a \nquality analyst. He is considered responsible and trustworthy.22 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n22 AE B. I have considered all of the documents provided by Applicant. \n\n \n7 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has numerous delinquent debts that remain unpaid and unresolved. He \nhas been aware of the debts and failed to contact some of the creditors. He failed to \nprovide reliable proof of his assertions that he paid certain debts and owes less than \nalleged. I find both disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAppellant has many debts he has not resolved and remain unpaid. In some \ncases he has not contacted the creditor to attempt to find out the status of the debt or \nresolve it. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply because Applicant has not \nprovided sufficient evidence to lead me to believe the circumstances are unlikely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant experienced periods of unemployment and underemployment. During \nthese periods he did not qualify for health benefits which impacted his finances. I find \nmitigating condition (b) partially applies because these were conditions beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. However, for the full application of (b) Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. I find he did not. Applicant provided little evidence \nto show he has contacted his creditors and attempted to resolve his delinquent debts. \nApplicant has not attended any meaningful financial counseling despite being aware of \nhis financial problems. He has failed to initiate good-faith efforts to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve his debts. He disputes some debts, but has not provided \nany proof of his actions. Applicant claims he is $1,800 in arrears on his child support, \nbut the documentation he provided refutes his claim. I find mitigating conditions (c), (d) \nand (e) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following:  \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant was unemployed and underemployed for a period of time. He was \naware he was not receiving health benefits. He had medical bills. He had difficulty \npaying his child support. He also admitted to receiving notices and phone calls from \ncollection agencies about his delinquent debts. He admitted when he completed his \nSCA he was embarrassed about his financial delinquencies. I find Applicant intentionally \nand deliberately failed to divulge the required information on his SCA. I find disqualifying \ncondition (a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nApplicant did not make an effort to correct the omissions and falsifications on his \nSCA before being confronted. His actions can not be considered minor because he \nfailed to divulge information that was pertinent to his security clearance investigation \nthereby casting doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. No evidence \nwas presented to confirm he has taken steps to reduce his vulnerability. I find none of \nthe mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant experienced periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. He was not receiving health benefits and \nincurred medical debts. Applicant intentionally did not acknowledge his financial \nproblems on his SCA, despite being aware of them. He disputed certain debts, but \nfailed to provide evidence to substantiate his dispute. He has failed to meet his burden \nof persuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Edmunds. Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA) on June 9, 2008.\nOn December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\nAugust 14, 2009\n\n Applicant referred to the consolidation plan as debt counseling. However, there is no evidence she received\n1\nfinancial counseling. \n2\nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on January 20, 2009, and requested\na hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March\n20, 2009 for a hearing on April 8, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the\nhearing, three exhibits (GE 1 through 3) were admitted into evidence without objection\nto support the government's case. Applicant testified and submitted fourteen exhibits\n(AE A-AE N). DOHA received the transcript and the record closed on April 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains eight allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant denied the allegations. The total amount of debt as of the date of the SOR\nwas $37,282. Her answers are incorporated into the following factual findings. \nApplicant is 44 years old. She has been married since July 2001. She has a 22-\nyear-old stepchild. She has been employed by her current employer since July 2005\n(GE 1). According to Section 26 of her SCA, she had a security clearance while working\nfor a previous employer in 1985 (Id.). She seeks a security clearance. \nApplicant testified she had some financial issues in 1998 and took action to\neliminate the issues (Tr. 36-37). She placed an unknown number of accounts in a debt\nconsolidation plan and paid $600 a month under the plan until she no longer had to\nmake payments (Tr. 38, 45).  She claimed she joined the plan so she would have to\n1\nmake only one payment, not because she was having difficulty meeting her financial\nobligations. (Tr. 39). She thought she had completed the plan before she broke her arm\nin 2000 when she received disability compensation (Tr. 38). Applicant indicated she\npurchased a house in 2003 and refinanced it in 2005. There were no indications she\nhad any delinquent debts during either transaction (Tr. 31).\nApplicant testified that to her knowledge none of the listed debts belonged to her\n(Tr. 27). The first time she found out about the delinquent debts was in June 2008 just\nbefore she certified and submitted her SCA. (Tr. 28). Even though she did not believe\nthe accounts belonged to her, she transferred the information about four delinquent\naccounts from her current credit report (also listed in the SOR) to her SCA under\nquestion 28a. She testified, \u201cThat I reported them because you need to go back 10\nyears and they were on the report and that I wasn\u2019t aware of them, but I wrote them\ndown because the form said to put them on the report (Tr. 45-46). In addition, even\nthough question 28a. refers to a seven-year window, Applicant testified she received\ncomputerized instruction to include debts within the last 10 years when answering the\nquestion. (Tr. 54-55). When asked why she did not deny the delinquent debts she listed\non her SCA, Applicant stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I had to do that.\u201d (Tr. 43-43)\nBetween June and November 2008, Applicant testified she called the listed\ncreditors by telephone, but received no response (Tr. 35). Prompted by a letter dated\n\n The credit report shows no delinquent accounts. \n2\n3\nOctober 14, 2008, that she received from her mortgage company stating that a former\nemployee of the company had stolen her personal identification, Applicant sent letters\non October 23, 2008, to two credit agencies warning that her personal information may\nhave been stolen by a \u201cnow ex-employee\u201d of her mortgage company (GE 2), and that\nshe was formally disputing the creditor identified in SOR 1.f. She also advised the\ngovernment in her interrogatory responses that she had the other accounts removed\nfrom her credit report or that she was disputing. (Id.)\nOn January 20, 2009 (same date as her answer to the SOR), Applicant sent a\ncertified letter to each one of the listed creditors indicating she did not recall opening the\naccount, and asking the creditor to provide information about the account (AE M). She\nreceived no response from any of the creditors (Tr. 31), and the accounts have been\nremoved from her credit report dated March 13, 2009 (AE N).  \n2\nAccording to Section 9 (living locations) of her SCA (GE 1), Applicant lived at\n\u201c[address] Carver Street\u201d in a city in Pennsylvania from November 1964 to November\n2001. From November 2001 to approximately January 2003, she lived at \u201c[address]\nBlair Mill Road\u201d address in a city in Pennsylvania north of her previous address (Tr. 43).\nFrom January 2003 to August 2004, she returned to live at the Carver street address.\nFrom August 2004 to the present, she has lived at \u201c[address] State Road [number],\u201d in\nFlorida (Id.). GE 3, the credit bureau report dated June 24, 2008, lists the Carver street\naddress and her current State Road address in Florida. \nThe eight delinquent debts listed in the SOR, that are based on the information in\nGE 3, shall be discussed in the order they appear in the SOR. \n\u00bb SOR 1.a. $2,762, rental debt, described as an individual installment account\n(GE 3). The credit report also reflects the last activity on the account before it became\ndelinquent was in August 2004. Applicant recalled renting the unit from the landlord\nbetween 2001 and 2003 at the Blair Mill Road address under a two-year lease that she\nindicated was converted to month-to-month (Tr. 39-40). She left her security deposit to\ncover the last period of rent, however, she vacated the premises without determining\nwhether she had a balance due (Id.). She still owes the debt. \n\u00bb SOR 1.b. $3,500, credit card, described in GE 3 as an individual revolving\naccount. The last activity on this account before it fell delinquent was in May 2002 (GE\n3). Applicant remembered having a checking account, a savings account, a certificate of\ndeposit, but no credit card account with this bank (Tr. 42). Applicant owes this account. \n\u00bb SOR 1.c. $2,200, credit card, described as an individual installment loan\naccount (GE 3). The last activity on this account was in November 2001 (Id.). Just\nbefore filling out her SCA (GE 1) in June 2008, Applicant obtained a credit report and\ntransferred information about this account from her credit report to question 28a. as one\nof her accounts over 180 days delinquent in the last seven years. As noted at the outset\n\n4\nof the factual findings section, she did not deny the debts she listed in her SCA because\nshe did not realize she had to do that (Tr. 43-44). I do not find her explanation credible. \n\u00bb SOR 1.d. $4,700, credit card, described as an individual revolving account (GE\n3). The account was opened in November 1986. The last activity on this account before\nit became delinquent was in July 2002. Exactly as she had done with SOR account 1.c.,\nApplicant listed this account under question 28a. of her SCA (GE 1) as being a second\naccount over 180 days delinquent. She recalled having a credit card from this company\nin the 1980s, but claimed she was never delinquent on the account (Tr. 46-47). She\nowes the account. \n\u00bb SOR 1.e. $8,500, credit card, described as an individual revolving account (GE\n3). The account was opened in September 1985. The last activity on the account before\nit became delinquent was in January 2003. Applicant listed this account under question\n28a of GE 1, but then claimed she never had an account with the creditor. She still\nowes the account. \n\u00bb SOR 1.f. $6,656, loan, described as an installment account. The last activity on\nthe account before becoming past due was in December 2006. Even though Applicant\ncontends she never had an account with the creditor, I do not find her claim credible.\nApplicant still owes the account. \n\u00bb SOR 1.g. $3,703, loan, described as individual open. The last activity on this\naccount before it converted to a delinquent account was in November 2001. Applicant\nlisted this account under question 28a. of GE 1, but testified she never had an account\nwith this creditor (Tr. 48). She still owes the account. \n\u00bb SOR 1.h. $5,261, credit card, incorrectly described as an individual installment\naccount. The last activity on this account was in November 2001. Applicant recalled\napplying for the card, but complained to the credit card official that she never received\nthe card (Id.). She still owes the account. \nThe combined salaries of Applicant and her husband allow them to pay all\nexpenses, and are the reason they have no delinquent accounts at the present time (Tr.\n32). They earn approximately $4,416 a month, and after monthly expenses and\nmortgage payments are subtracted, Applicant and her husband have a net monthly\nremainder of $1,161 (GE 2). Their net worth over $100,000 (AE L) will enable them to\npay all the delinquent accounts if proof is presented to her (Tr. 32-33). \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations from 2005 through 2008 reflect successful\nratings. Seven character statements from colleagues or supervisors describe Applicant\nas a real professional who applies her excellent work ethic at all times. Witness A, who\nalso provided a character statement (AE A), has worked with Applicant for three years\nand is impressed with her honesty and trustworthiness (Tr. 20-24). Applicant told him\n\n5\nshe has not incurred any additional debt while working for him, and tried hard not let her\nfinances get out of control when she was younger (Id.). She also informed him that after\nfinding out she had inaccurate entries on her credit report, she had the information\nremoved (Tr. 25).\nWitness E, who also prepared a character statement (AE E), is employed as an\nadministrative assistant just like Applicant. She testified that their jobs involve expense\nreporting, meeting schedules, making travel arrangements, and conducting accounting\nfunctions. Witness E considers Applicant trustworthy and dependable (Tr. 14). Applicant\ncollected almost $4,000 for Witness E\u2019s son after his house was destroyed by fire (Tr.\n15). Witness E believes Applicant wrote letters to certain creditors and the accounts\nwere cleared (Tr. 17). \nCredibility Findings\nConsidering the entire record as a whole, I find that GE 3 contains accurate\ninformation about Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts. This finding is based on fact that the\npersonal information in her credit report (GE 3) matches the personal information\nprovided by Applicant in her June 2008 SCA (GE 1). Also, information which Applicant\nprovided in her June 2008 SCA about four of her delinquent accounts is very similar to\nthe information appearing in her credit report (GE 3). \nHaving observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and conduct as she testified, I find her\ncredibility undermined in several areas of her testimony. In her answer and initial\ntestimony, she denied all debt allegations. On cross-examination she recognized at\nleast two of the debts. Regarding the debt consolidation plan in 1998, she claims she\nenrolled in the plan to reduce the number of payments to her creditors to one monthly\npayment, not because she had problems paying her creditors. Though she transferred\ninformation about four delinquent accounts from her credit report to her June 2008,\nSCA, she believed the accounts were not her responsibility, yet she did not dispute the\naccounts in her SCA because she did not think she had that option. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on common sense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" Finally, the Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\n\n6\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nParagraph 18 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) sets forth the security concern\nrelated to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\n\n7\nThe government has established its case under the financial guideline. Applicant\nopened eight credit card or installment loan accounts at various times in the 1980s,\n1990s, and between 2000 and 2002. I believe her financial issues in the late 1990s\nwere financial problems manifested by an inability to pay her debts, and constituted the\nreason she joined the consolidation plan. The existence of the listed debts today\npersuades me to conclude she did not successfully complete the plan. \nWhen she filled out her SCA in June 2008, she dutifully listed the delinquent\ndebts as she knew they were her responsibility. After Applicant submitted her SCA and\nbefore she provided interrogatory responses in November 2008 (GE 2), she concluded\nthe debts were not her responsibility. She formally disputed the SOR 1.f. creditor in\nOctober 2008, and, as she had done with the other listed creditors, had all the\ndelinquent accounts removed from her credit report by March 2009 (AE N). The debts\nstill are Applicant\u2019s responsibility even though they are legally unenforceable. Both FC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC\nDC \u00b6 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply to the circumstances of this\ncase.\nFive of the six mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case: FC mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20.a. (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness,\nand good judgment); FC MC \u00b6 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances); FC MC \u00b6 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control); FC MC \u00b6 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts); and, FC MC \u00b6 20.e. (the individual\nhas a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause\nof the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue). \nThough the listed debts have been delinquent for a lengthy period of time,\nApplicant still owes the eight debts totaling $37,282. Applicant\u2019s ongoing refusal to\naccept responsibility for the debts continues to cast doubt on her current reliability and\njudgment. FC MC \u00b6 20.a. is not applicable. \nFC MC \u00b6 20.b. provides mitigation for unanticipated circumstances that are not\npresent here. First, the mitigating weight to be applied to Applicant\u2019s broken arm in 2000\nis dramatically diminished by the passage of more than eight years after the injury.\nApplicant has been employed by her current employer since 2005. The only action by\nher to address her delinquencies was to have the debts removed from her credit report\nin 2008 and 2009. I do not interpret Applicant\u2019s actions as falling within the last clause of\nthe mitigator (and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\n\n8\nFC MC \u00b6 20.c. is inapplicable to this case. While Applicant referred to her debt\nconsolidation plan as debt counseling, there is no evidence she had financial\ncounseling. Her failure to at least accept responsibility for her delinquent debts that are\nno longer enforceable, continues to raise security concerns about her judgment that\nhave not been overcome by her favorable character evidence. Her readiness to pay the\ndebt if presented with proof is not mitigating.  \nFC MC \u00b6 20.d. does not apply because the mitigator calls for a good-faith,\naffirmative action, including bankruptcy, by the individual to resolve her indebtedness.\nApplicant\u2019s decision to avoid paying her debts because they are unenforceable is a legal\ncourse of action. However, it does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve her\ndebts as contemplated under FC MC \u00b6 20.d.\nFC MC \u00b6 20.e. does not apply as I have concluded Applicant was not disputing\nthe validity of the listed debts. I have concluded her reason for seeking removal of the\ndebts, as exemplified by her identification of the SOR 1.a. creditor which she admitted,\nwas because the statute of limitations had run. I have carefully evaluated the\ncommendable reputation she has built with her employer. Aside from the delinquent\ndebts that are no longer enforceable, she has no current delinquent debt. Considering\nthe evidence as a whole, I still find she has not satisfied her ultimate burden of\npersuasion under the financial guideline. \nWhole Person Concept\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\nAG\u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nIn 1998, Applicant was 33 years old and had financial problems. She exercised\ngood judgment by seeking help through a debt consolidation plan. However, the\ncontinued existence of the debts infers she did not complete the plan. More than eight\nyears has passed without any action by Applicant in addressing the debts. \nAt some point after she submitted her SCA in June 2008 and before she\nprovided her interrogatory responses in March 2009 (AE N), she had all the listed\n\n9\ncreditors removed from her report. See also, GE 2. In obtaining the removal of the listed\ncreditors from her credit report, it is clear that Applicant employed the statute of\nlimitations to handle her debt rather than working out a plan to either pay the creditors\nor seek relief through the bankruptcy laws. Notwithstanding the favorable character\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s job performance and stable financial position, she cannot be\ngiven credit for waiting out the statute of limitations when she has had resources to pay\nthe indebtedness. She has furnished no evidence of repayment of the listed creditors for\nover eight years. She does not demonstrate the trustworthiness, reliability or good\njudgment required under the financial guideline. Accordingly, the financial guideline is\nresolved against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On April 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J \n(Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 17, 2009. She requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 26, \n2009. I received the case assignment on May 27, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on June 5, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 23, 2009. \nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through K, without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting the date of \n\u201cSeptember 8, 2008\u201d in Subparagraph 1.a. and substituting therefore the date of \u201cApril \n25, 2007.\u201d  Applicant had no objection to this amendment because it inserted the correct \ndate of her arrest on child endangerment charges for an erroneous date.  I granted the \nmotion. (Tr. 9-11) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR, with explanations. She also provided additional information to support her request \nfor continued eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old, divorced in 2009 from her husband, and the mother of \ntwo minor children. The first child was born in 2004, and the second daughter in 2007. \nApplicant married her husband in November 1994, during her first semester of college. \nShe graduated from college in 1998 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics. Since \nthen, she has worked for a defense contractor. (Tr. 34, 40-45, 60; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband worked while she attended college. After she became \nemployed upon her graduation, he became a non-working husband from 1999 until his \narrest in September 2006. He was arrested on the accusations of his daughter from his \nfirst marriage that he had molested her. Her husband\u2019s daughter lived with them from \n1999 to 2006. He was convicted on his guilty plea, and sentenced to five years \nconfinement. Applicant filed for divorce from him in October 2008, and the divorce was \ngranted in March 2009. Applicant would file for a protective order if her former husband \nattempted to contact her or their children. The divorce decree prohibited contact \nbetween Applicant\u2019s children and her former husband. (Tr. 40-44, 50-52, 69, 70; \nExhibits 1 and 2) \n \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s husband was arrested in 2006, the police searched the house \nfor evidence on the molestation charge. During that process, they found animal feces \nfrom the three dogs and one cat Applicant\u2019s family maintained, though Applicant only \nrecalls feces in the basement area.  The police reported seeing a cockroach crawl from \ndiapers to be used for Applicant\u2019s infant daughter. Applicant admits cockroaches \ninfested her house for months before the arrest, but she never saw any near her \ndaughter. She attempted to kill the cockroaches with insecticides from the hardware \nstore, but was unsuccessful. The arresting officers also reported piles of debris \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthroughout the house, making the house interior messy. Applicant\u2019s husband took care \nof the dogs, but did not clean up after them. He also did some cooking, but never \nwashed the dishes. He was a compulsive buyer of various objects including beads for \nhis jewelry making hobby, clothes he never put away neatly, and many other items \nwhich were never used or stored properly, resulting in the messy appearance of the \nhome. Additionally, the police reported a repugnant odor throughout the house which \nApplicant claimed she did not smell. Finally, there were prescription medications kept in \nchild-proof containers but within the reach of Applicant\u2019s daughter and step-daughter. \n(Tr. 36, 47-57, 77, 78; Exhibits 2-4)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was diagnosed as bi-polar in 2003 and used prescription \nmedications to treat his condition. He also controlled and manipulated Applicant from \nthe date of their marriage until his arrest by limiting her contact with her family and \nfriends, and exerting other forms of control over her activities.  Applicant did not \nrecognize the situation because it occurred gradually over time.  She tried to keep the \nfamily together by working all day, taking care of the children, including home-schooling \nher step-daughter, and doing what work she could around the house without upsetting \nher husband.  She described her actions as \u201cwalking on egg shells\u201d when dealing with \nhim. (Tr. 22, 30-39, 54, 66, 73, 81) \n \n \nApplicant was charged in April 2007 with two counts of felony endangerment of a \nchild under state law. She turned herself into the police to respond to the charges.  She \nretained an attorney. The first charge referred to the endangerment of her step-\ndaughter, and the second to her only child at that time, her daughter. The \nendangerment allegations were that she did not maintain a residence fit for human \nhabitation. In April 2008, Applicant pled guilty to both felonies.  She pled guilty to avoid \nbeing sentenced to jail. The state court sentenced Applicant to 90 days home \nconfinement on the first charge, and five years confinement on the second charge. \nHowever, the confinement was suspended and Applicant was sentenced alternatively to \nfive years probation, attendance at parenting classes, psychological evaluation and \ntreatment as directed by the probation services in her state, and adherence to any other \ndirectives issued as part of her probation. Applicant has now served 18 months \nsuccessfully on her probation. Applicant completed the parenting classes swiftly. She \ncleaned her house and sold it.  She purchased another one, and regained custody of \nher oldest daughter whom the state had placed in foster care for six months. (Tr. 24, 53, \n64, 65, 84, 88; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant consulted with a marriage counselor in 1997 and 2000. She also went \nto a family counselor in 2006. She read books on setting personal boundaries, and \nconsulted with friends on personal relationships. Applicant had psychological counseling \nin 2006 and early 2007 pursuant to court order. She testified that counseling found only \nher parenting skills needed improvement. Now Applicant contends her prior lack of good \njudgment will not recur, and she has learned and changed much in the past three years \nsince her arrest.  In Applicant\u2019s own opinion, she provides a good household for her \ndaughters, and will not allow herself to be manipulated. Her mother\u2019s testimony is that \nApplicant is so organized that she prepares and freezes the meals for the upcoming \n\n \n4 \n \n \nweek each weekend. Applicant does not want to do anything to risk losing her children \nto foster care again. She is better organized and focused since her divorce.  (Tr. 23, 25, \n68-70, 77, 78, 84-87)  \n \n \nFrom 1998 to the present time, Applicant had a \u201csecret\u201d security clearance. She \ndid not have any security violations reported in that 11-year period. In 2006, Applicant \nearned $75,000 from her job. She graduated from college \u201csumma cum laude.\u201d \nApplicant made a well-organized and articulate presentation of her case. (Tr. 45, 46, 60, \n64) \n \n \nApplicant submitted 11 character letters. Her Answer to the SOR included a \ncharacter letter from her job\u2019s team leader. This character letter describes Applicant as \nsincere and dedicated to her job. Applicant is recognized as someone who maintains \ndiligently the security of classified information. He reports that in the past Applicant had \nsome instances of \u201cpoor performance within the team\u201d that he ascribes to her domestic \nsituation at the time. In the past two years, her performance has steadily improved.  She \nalso kept him and other supervisors informed about her situation. Applicant\u2019s brother \nsubmitted a letter discussing the family situation and how it has improved after \nApplicant\u2019s husband was arrested and she divorced him. The remaining character \nletters praise Applicant for her honest and competent work. One letter was submitted by \nthe foster parents of Applicant\u2019s child in 2006 and 2007. They make announced and \nunannounced visits to Applicant\u2019s home, and report it is clean and safe, as are her \nchildren.  (Exhibits A to K) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.  Of these conditions, three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant pled guilty to two state felony charges of child \nendangerment. Her sentence included five years of probation, starting in April 2008. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant remains on probation at the present time. Thus, these three conditions are \nsupported by the facts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides five conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Three \nmitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nThe facts of Applicant\u2019s child endangerment charges occurred during an \noppressive marriage to a controlling and physically lazy man. Applicant earned the \nhousehold income, maintained the house, and home-schooled her stepdaughter, \nrepeating this process each day. Her husband was arrested in 2006 for child \nmolestation and convicted. His sentence of five years confinement allowed Applicant to \nbreak free from his control. She divorced him, sold their former home, bought a new \none, and regained custody of her child. She will obtain a protective order to keep her \nformer husband away from herself and her children. Applicant has learned to make her \nown decisions and be responsible for her own actions. Her character statements show \npersuasively that her family situation has improved greatly. During all the home turmoil, \nApplicant continued to perform well at her job. AG \u00b6 32 (a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant is intelligent and well-educated. However, she lacked personal strength \nto recognize that her marital situation was destructive and that she was too subservient \nto her husband. Her husband controlled every aspect of her life within the marriage. The \npressures her husband exerted on her are gone and will not return.  She divorced him \nand he resides in a state penitentiary for five years until 2012. AG \u00b6 32 (b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant reformed her life. She took control of it, although it took state criminal \naction and her step-daughter\u2019s complaint against her husband to start the reform \nprocess.  Applicant accepted responsibility for her actions by pleading guilty to two child \nendangerment charges for not maintaining her house in a habitable condition. She \nexpressed remorse for her actions during her marriage, and emphasized her \ncommitment to her children. She vowed not to do anything in the future to jeopardize \nher custody of them. Her brother and mother presented evidence of Applicant\u2019s marital \nhistory and how that environment in her home has dramatically improved. Applicant \nattended parenting classes, and completed all probationary requirements, other than \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe time period imposed by the court. Her supervisors\u2019 character statements show \nApplicant is well-regarded in her company for her work ethic and product. AG\u00b6 32 (d) \napplies. \n \n Guideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying.  One of these conditions applies to Applicant\u2019s child endangerment \nsituation and felony convictions: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to maintain a healthy home environment for her child, and her \nstep-daughter, coupled with her continued failure over 12 years to recognize the \ncontrolling environment created by her husband and his molestation of his daughter, is \npersonal conduct by Applicant that made her vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress.  In addition, Applicant was exploited, manipulated, and placed under duress by \nher husband during the duration of their marriage. For an intelligent and educated \n\n \n8 \n \n \nperson to have acted in such a way causes serious concerns about her judgment and \nher ability to be manipulated easily. AG \u00b6 16 (e) applies. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  Four of these \nmitigating conditions could apply: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nThree years have passed since Applicant\u2019s husband was removed from her life \nby his arrest and conviction for child molestation. She divorced him in 2009 and has not \nresumed any contact with him, and does not want to do so. She transformed her life, \nand provides a healthy and happy environment for her two daughters. While in the \nmarriage, she attempted to do all the work in the house and earn the family income, but \nfailed to recognize the gradual and systematic control her husband exerted over all the \nfamily members. Her judgment was overwhelmed by her husband at home.  Her \nreliability and trustworthiness were not at issue in the work environment, nor was her \njudgment. ( AG \u00b6 17 (a) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted her failure to keep the house and children clean, and allowing \nher husband to accumulate things which cluttered the house. She admits the house was \na mess. Now she has her own home without her husband, and the character witnesses \nwho have been in that home state that the children and home environment are neat and \nclean. Applicant participated in the court-ordered counseling, and obtained more \ninformation on her own in the past three years. The divorce prevents Applicant from \ncontinuing her past behavior, and it is unlikely to recur based on the significant changes \nand honest admissions Applicant made. AG \u00b6 17 (d) applies. \n \n \nApplicant divorced her husband and acknowledges the manipulative control he \nexercised over her during their marriage. She strongly asserts she is now in control of \nher life, and will not allow the same situation to recur. She is credible in that assertion.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nIt is bolstered by her demonstrated commitment to her children\u2019s welfare. AG \u00b6 17 (e) \napplies.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce removes her from the person who committed criminal activity, \nher former husband. He contributed largely to the mess in their house which created the \nunhealthy environment for Applicant\u2019s children. He also committed the criminal child \nmolestation acts upon his daughter from his first marriage. Applicant has now removed \nherself totally from that unhealthy environment. She is committed to keeping her former \nhusband away from her and her children. AG \u00b6 17 (g) applies.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that each case be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an educated mature \nadult when the unsanitary environment was created. She was not emotionally strong \nenough to assert herself against her husband\u2019s control, and allowed the situation to \ncontinue. Her actions were not appropriate but understandable in the context of the \ncontrolling aspects of her marriage. She has changed her behavior, admitted her \nwrongdoing, taken corrective action, and removed the potential for coercion, pressure, \nexploitation, or duress within her personal relationships. Her past behavior is not likely \nto recur.   \n \nFurthermore, Applicant has had a security clearance for 11 years without any \nsecurity violations. She kept her personal situation separate from her work relationship.  \n \nApplicant realizes she made harmful mistakes that hurt herself and children by \ncontinuing her marriage to a controlling and manipulative man.  She was not an equal \n\n \n10 \n \n \npartner in that relationship. The total environment contributed to the endangerment \nsituation that led to criminal charges. Now Applicant has corrected the problem. Her \nfamily and friends know of her past problems, and gave letters of support showing the \nrehabilitation Applicant has done.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s presentation was credible and persuasive on all the salient and \nrelevant issues. She did not contest the felony charges placed against her, which is part \nof her rehabilitative efforts. She has clearly made the well-being of her children \nparamount in her life.  She is successfully participating in the probation the state court \nimposed as her sentence on the second felony child endangerment charge.  Applicant \ninformed her supervisors of her situation, and she has been allowed to retain her job. It \nhas been three years since her husband was arrested and removed from the home.  \nApplicant has used that time to her advantage to acknowledge her past errors and \nchange her behavior to benefit her children and herself. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her criminal conduct \nand personal conduct.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\nMay 29, 2009\n\n The job termination is not alleged in the SOR. \n1\n2\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 14, 2009. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on March 23, 2009 for a hearing on April 7, 2009. At the hearing,\nthree exhibits (GE I through 3) were admitted in evidence without objection to support\nthe government's case. Applicant testified and submitted nine exhibits (AE A-AE I). In\nthe time allowed for him to furnish additional documentation, he submitted AE J through\nQ. DOHA received the transcript on April 15, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 32 years old and single. He is employed as a senior systems\nengineer, and has held that position since he was hired by a defense contractor in\nOctober 2007. As a senior systems engineer, Applicant designs visual systems, locates\ntrouble in the system, and repairs the systems. He seeks a security clearance \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent accounts totaling $23,309 under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. All but SOR 1.g. became delinquent in 2005 and 2006. SOR\n1.g. fell delinquent in June 2007. Applicant\u2019s denial of SOR 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g., is\nbased on the debts being paid or settled through his credit negotiating firm. He admitted\nthe other debts in the SOR have not been resolved. Applicant\u2019s admissions shall be\nincluded in the following factual findings.\nApplicant was employed as a sales manager in 2004. He was misusing a\ncompany credit card to purchase personal items. After his employer discovered the\ncredit card misuse, Applicant made restitution, then he was fired (Tr. 35; GE 1).  \n1\nApplicant immediately found another job, though the earnings were markedly\nlower. He fell behind on credit card payments, and tried unsuccessfully to sell his house.\nThe creditors did not want to negotiate with him. Then, he decided to keep paying his\nmortgage, and let the credit card payments lapse until he could obtain a better paying\njob. He kept looking for employment that paid more, and eventually found a job in\nJanuary 2007 that allowed him to begin addressing his delinquent debts.\nIn April 2007, Applicant entered into a contract with a debt negotiating firm, and\nbegan paying $370 a month to the firm for payment of his debts (Tr. 32; GE 2). The firm\nmaintains Applicant\u2019s monthly payments in an account until it is determined enough\nmoney has been collected to settle a delinquent account. Then the firm contacts the\ncreditor/collection agency to negotiate a settlement. Applicant paid off four creditors\nbefore receiving the SOR. He settled a bank credit card in November 2007 for $570, a\ndelinquent account from a home improvement store in January 2008 for $477, a golf\nequipment account for $624 in April 2008, and, a listed account for $236 in May 2008\n(GE 2). He began paying the SOR 1.a. collection firm about $100 a month in January\n2008 (Tr. 38; GE 2, AE A, AE Q4-Q13).\n\n There has been no action taken on this account either for the reason furnished in SOR 1.c.\n2\n3\n# SOR 1.a. $6,904, bank credit card. This is the only account that is not included\nin the debt firm plan. Applicant has been paying the collection firm $100 a month since\nearly 2008 (AE A, Q4-Q 13). He has made 11 payments, but does not know the balance\nowing. \n# SOR 1.b. $1,050, credit card. Applicant\u2019s debt firm negotiated a settlement of\n$734 that was to be paid over three payments of $149, $435, and $149 (AE B).\nApplicant\u2019s debt negotiating firm made the payments, and the debt is extinguished (AE\nJ1, J2, J3). \n# SOR 1.c. $3,991, credit card. The debt firm has taken no action on this account\nbecause it has probably not collected enough funds to negotiate with the creditor. \n# SOR 1.d. $3,323, credit card.2\n# SOR 1.e. $517, discount clothes credit card. As noted in GE 2 and AE J4, this\naccount was settled on May 12, 2008 for $236. \n# SOR 1.f. $2,434, bank credit card. First, a stipulation was entered on\nSeptember 1, 2008 to settle the account in three payments (AE H). After Applicant met\nthe payment schedule, an Order for Dismissal was entered on October 17, 2008,\nremoving him from further obligations under the stipulation (Id.).\n# SOR 1.g. $169, insurance premium. Applicant was notified on February 24,\n2009 that he paid the delinquent premium in full (AE D).\n# SOR 1.h. $4,921, home improvement store credit card. Applicant\u2019s debt firm\nhas taken no action on this account. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly remainder after subtracting his expenses ($1,400) and debt\npayments ($1,967) from his monthly net income ($3,807) is $440. He owns his home\nthat is currently valued at about $150,000 (Tr. 46), with a mortgage of $1,249 a month\n(Tr. 48). He owns a 2003 vehicle, and is currently making monthly payments of $280\n(Tr. 46-47). He has no other outstanding debts, and is current on his federal and state\ntaxes (Tr. 47). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded in\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b618. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s job loss in 2004 caused him to fall delinquent to several creditors. He\ndeveloped a history of debt problems that totaled $23,309 by the time the SOR was\npublished in February 2009. FC disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b6 19.c. (a history not meeting financial\nobligations) apply.\nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n\u00b6 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment). FC MC \u00b6 20.a. applies even though\nApplicant\u2019s firing occurred less than five years ago, and involved a breach of trust\nbetween Applicant and his former employer. Applicant has convinced me with his\nconduct since October 2004 that he will not commit this kind of poor judgment in the\nfuture. He wasted no time in securing another job, and then launching a plan in April\n2007 to pay off the delinquent accounts. After six months of regular payments to the\ndebt settlement firm, Applicant resolved an unlisted, delinquent bank account for $570.\nHe settled this account and three additional accounts before the SOR was published in\nFebruary 2009. FC MC \u00b6 20.a. applies.\nApplicant\u2019s financial misfortune was due to conditions within his control. His\nmisuse of the company credit card was a voluntary choice leading to his termination\nfrom his sales position. FC MC \u00b6 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control and individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances) applies where the financial problems were caused by\nunanticipated rather than anticipated events. Applicant knew or should have known\nwhen he used the company credit card for personal needs that he risked severe\ndisciplinary action. Applicant receives no mitigation under FC MC \u00b6 20.b., even though\nhe exercised good judgment in steadily eliminating his financial problems since April\n2007.\nFC MC \u00b6 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol) is inapplicable as far as financial counseling is concerned. The record is silent\non the subject. However, Applicant\u2019s enrollment in the debt negotiation plan in April\n2007, and the documented progress he has made in repaying delinquent creditors\nconstitutes persuasive evidence Applicant is gaining control over his financial problems.\nFC MC \u00b6 20.c. applies.\nApplicant also receives considerable credit under FC MC \u00b6 20.d. (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) for\nsuccessfully settling obligations to the creditors in SOR 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and also four\nunlisted creditors. See, AE P. He has made 11 payments of $100 to the SOR 1.a.\ncreditor since early 2008, and intends to continue with his plan until all past due debts\nare resolved. Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation prevails over the adverse evidence of\nfinancial irresponsibility.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nIn 2004, Applicant took advantage of his relationship with his employer by\nconverting a company credit card for his own purposes. He was caught and dismissed\nafter providing restitution. Losing a job under these circumstances raises unavoidable\nquestions about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability. However, as indicated in his\nSCA (GE 1), Applicant did not attempt to hide his termination. At the hearing, he was\nunequivocal about his firing. Given his forthrightness during the security investigation,\nand his documented efforts in repaying the listed and unlisted creditors, while regularly\naccumulating the necessary funds through the debt firm since April 2007 to pay off the\nremaining creditors, he has demonstrated his suitability for security clearance access. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g. \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement) that Applicant used marijuana about five or six times per year from December 2004 to December 2007 (SOR 1.a) and that he used the prescription drug Vicodin on various occasions when it had not been prescribed for him (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted the abuse of marijuana. He also acknowledged he had used Vicodin when it had not been prescribed for him, but only on a single occasion. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old senior help desk technician who has worked since late June 2008 as a contractor on a military installation (Ex. J, Tr. 86). He stayed on in his position when the contract was taken over by another defense contractor in February 2009 (Ex. J, Tr. 87). He seeks a secret security clearance for his present employment (Tr. 91). Applicant graduated from high school in June 1996. From July 1996 to November 1997, he was a sales associate in electronics for a discount retailer. In November 1997, he enlisted in the U.S. military with the hope of making his career in the service (Tr. 63). On February 12, 1998, he completed a security clearance application (SF 86) for a security clearance for his duties in electronic warfare (Ex. 2).

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant smoked marijuana about five to six times yearly from December 31,\n2005, to December 31, 2007. He also took the prescription drug Vicodin at least once in\n2006 when it had not been prescribed for him. Applicant has not abused any drugs\nsince he started working for a defense contractor, and he intends no future involvement.\nClearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on November 20, 2008. On January 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant detailing the\n1\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H that provided the basis for its preliminary decision\nto deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nSeptember 9, 2009\n\n2\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nIn answers to the SOR dated February 19, 2009, and March 30, 2009, Applicant\nrequested a decision based on the written record. The government requested a hearing,\nand on May 15, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. On June 2, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for June 30, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and\n14 Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-N) were entered into evidence without any objections, and\nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on July 9, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement) that Applicant used\nmarijuana about five or six times per year from December 2004 to December 2007\n(SOR 1.a) and that he used the prescription drug Vicodin on various occasions when it\nhad not been prescribed for him (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted the abuse of marijuana.\nHe also acknowledged he had used Vicodin when it had not been prescribed for him,\nbut only on a single occasion. After considering the evidence of record, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old senior help desk technician who has worked since late\nJune 2008 as a contractor on a military installation (Ex. J, Tr. 86). He stayed on in his\nposition when the contract was taken over by another defense contractor in February\n2009 (Ex. J, Tr. 87). He seeks a secret security clearance for his present employment\n(Tr. 91).    \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1996. From July 1996 to November\n1997, he was a sales associate in electronics for a discount retailer. In November 1997,\nhe enlisted in the U.S. military with the hope of making his career in the service (Tr. 63).\nOn February 12, 1998, he completed a security clearance application (SF 86) for a\nsecurity clearance for his duties in electronic warfare (Ex. 2). He was granted a top\nsecret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information in about July 1998\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 90).\nApplicant and his spouse married in November 1998. They had two children\nwhile Applicant was in the military, sons born in August 1999 and March 2001 (Exs. 1,\nJ). Applicant had medical issues through most of his four-year enlistment term. Due to\nhis specialty code, his duty was extended after September 11, 2001, until November\n2002 (Exs. 1, J, Tr. 62). \nFollowing his release from active duty, Applicant and his family returned home.\nApplicant collected unemployment until October 2003, when he got a job as a manager\nfor a video company (Ex. 1, Tr. 63). In or before March 2005, he and his spouse bought\n\nAccording to his SF 86, Applicant has resided at the same residence since March 2005 (Ex. 1). Yet\n2\nApplicant\u2019s father indicates that Applicant and his spouse bought their home in February 2004 (Ex. J). The\ndate that Applicant purchased their current residence is significant, given his testimony (correcting earlier\nrepresentations of an initial use of marijuana on December 31, 2004) that he did not begin smoking marijuana\nuntil after his brother moved into their home in November 2005. Since Applicant had been unemployed from\nNovember 2002 to October 2003, it is difficult to see where he would have been financially able to buy a home\nin February or March 2004. Applicant\u2019s father corroborated the November 2005 date as when Applicant\u2019s\nbrother moved from his home and began residing with Applicant. The available information tends to support\nan initial usage of marijuana by Applicant on December 31, 2005.\n3\ntheir current residence (Ex. 1, Tr. 59, 63).  Applicant\u2019s brother, who was a user of\n2\nmarijuana, began to \u201chang out\u201d with his friends at Applicant\u2019s new home. In November\n2005, his brother was thrown out of their parents\u2019 home because of his \u201cantics\u201d and\n\u201cdisreputable\u201d associates (Ex. J). Applicant and his spouse took him into their home (Tr.\n63). On or about December 31, 2005, while under the influence of alcohol at a party,\nApplicant succumbed to peer pressure and smoked marijuana with his brother (Tr. 60,\n63-64). With little in the way of career plans at that time, Applicant used marijuana while\nsocializing with his brother and at times also with his brother\u2019s friends on an estimated\nfive to six occasions per year through December 31, 2007 (Exs. 1, 3, Tr. 92). Applicant\u2019s\nmarijuana use was limited to circumstances where it was offered to him and he did not\nseek out the drug (Tr. 97). His spouse, who did not smoke marijuana, did not approve of\nhis use (\u201cShe knew and she yelled at me day in and day out about it.\u201d Tr. 117).\nApplicant knew it was \u201cwrong\u201d for him to smoke the marijuana (Tr. 64).\nIn the summer of 2006, while helping his parents put in a pool, Applicant injured\nhis back where he could not get off the couch. His mother gave him one of her\nprescription Vicodin pills for pain (Tr. 108-09. 118-19).\nIn October 2006, Applicant was terminated from his job for reasons unrelated to\ndrug use, and he started college studies toward an associate degree in science (Ex. 1,\nTr. 64). In June 2007, he began working part-time as a customer service representative\nfor a bank while continuing to pursue his studies full-time at night in electronics (Exs. 1,\nJ, Tr. 65, 100). Applicant declined some, but not all, offers from his brother to smoke\nmarijuana (Tr. 106). Applicant did not use marijuana while he was studying, when he\nhad to work, or if his children were around (Tr. 95-96). As he was entering his last\nsemester of college, Applicant realized that he needed to provide a \u201cgood foundation\u201d\nfor his children and family. He resolved to forego any future involvement with marijuana.\nHe finished his studies in March 2008 (Ex. 1, Tr. 86), and in May 2008, he graduated on\nthe Dean\u2019s List with a cumulative grade point average higher than 3.6. He was elected\nto a national honor society (Exs. B, C, Tr. 65-66).\nIn late June 2008, Applicant started working as a defense contractor on a military\nbase. He was required to take a drug test on commencing his employment and it was\nnegative for all substances tested (Tr. 87).\nOn June 20, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP that he subsequently signed on\nNovember 20, 2008. He responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 24.a on the e-QIP concerning any\nillegal drug use in the last seven years, and disclosed \u201coccasional infrequent use\u201d of\n\nApplicant now recalls that his first use of marijuana was on December 31, 2005, rather than on\n3\nDecember 31, 2004, as he had previously reported (Tr. 59-60). He does not recall using marijuana with his\nbrother until after he and his spouse had taken his brother into their home, which they purchased in March\n2005 (Tr. 93).\nThe investigator reported the following with respect to Applicant\u2019s involvement with Vicodin:\n4\nTHE SUBJECT HAS TAKEN PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATION, SPECIFICALLY VICODIN, ON\nVARIOUS OCCASIONS (EXACT AMOUNT UNKNOW N). AFTER INJURING HIS BACK W HILE\nHELPING HIS MOTHER MAINTAIN A RESIDENCE, THE SUBJECT ACCEPTED THE\nPRESCRIPTION MEDICATION FROM HIS MOTHER IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE BACK PAIN.\nTHE SUBJECT DID NOT PAY FOR THE DRUG AS HE W AS GIVEN THE DRUG\nCOMPLEMENTARY. (Ex. 3).\nApplicant asserted at his hearing that he told the agent about the one-time use, which he had failed to recall\nwhen he completed his SF 86. He denies that he took it more than once and has no explanation for why the\nagent had indicated he used it on various occasions (Tr. 123). Applicant had the opportunity to review the\ninvestigator\u2019s report in October/November 2008. Asked why he did not correct the record to accurately reflect\nthat he had used the Vicodin only once, Applicant responded, \u201cI may have missed that part.\u201d (Tr. 126).\nW hether or not Applicant took one pill or more than one, the record evidence shows it was limited in time.\n4\nmarijuana between the estimated dates of December 2004 and December 2007 (Ex.\n1).3\nOn August 25, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his illegal drug involvement. Applicant related that on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2004, he\naccepted an offer of marijuana from his brother, who was a regular user of the drug.\nApplicant estimated that between December 2004 and December 2007, he smoked a\nmarijuana cigarette about five or six times per year on holidays and social gatherings at\nhis home. Applicant denied any purchase of marijuana. He averred that he stopped\nusing marijuana after New Year\u2019s Eve 2007 as he decided to pursue employment with\nthe U.S. government or a government contractor and knew that it would not be\ntolerated. Applicant admitted that he still socialized with his brother and brother\u2019s friends\nwho use marijuana but he denied any intent to use marijuana himself. Applicant\nindicated that in the last seven years, he had accepted his mother\u2019s offer of her Vicodin\nmedication after he had injured his back while helping her. He did not consider his use\nof the drug to constitute abuse under the circumstances (Ex. 3).4\nApplicant\u2019s brother was a source of stress in the family household. He paid rent\nand helped out with caring for Applicant\u2019s children, but his unreliability and lying led\nApplicant to \u201cevict\u201d him from the home several times (Ex. J, Tr. 72, 107). Because he\nwas family, Applicant gave him second chances and took him back in. As of November\n2008, Applicant\u2019s brother was living in Applicant\u2019s home but with the understanding that\ndrug use or being under the influence of drugs would not be tolerated in the household\n(Ex. 3, Tr. 107). In response to DOHA interrogatories about his drug use, Applicant on\nNovember 4, 2008, indicated that he used marijuana from December 2004 to December\n2007, when he stopped in order to secure a more stable future and reliable income for\nhis family (Ex. 3).\n\n5\nIn November 2008, Applicant was placed on medications for diagnosed insomnia\nand sleep apnea (Tr. 77-78). He understands that any illegal drug use would be\nincompatible with his medications and is not willing to risk his health \u201cjust for a few\nhours of entertainment\u201d (Tr. 78).\nAs of February 2009, Applicant\u2019s brother had been \u201cevicted\u201d from Applicant\u2019s\nhome. He was around the household only when he was watching Applicant\u2019s children.\nHe had completely removed his personal belongings from Applicant\u2019s home as of\nsometime in March 2009 (Answer, Tr. 112). As of late June 2009, Applicant\u2019s brother\nwas no longer watching his children for him (Tr. 113).\nIn February 2009, the company employing Applicant lost the contract for the\ninformation technology services at the military base. Applicant\u2019s employment was\ntransferred to a new defense contractor. He was required to again submit to a drug test,\nwhich he passed (Tr. 87). On February 19, 2009, Applicant executed a statement of\nintent to not abuse any drugs in the future with the understanding that his clearance\nwould be automatically revoked for any violation (Ex. A).\nAs a member of a 20-person department, Applicant proved to be highly\ncommitted, focused, and reliable. Due to his \u201cunique skill sets,\u201d Applicant worked on\nseveral projects for a rear admiral for six months. The admiral, aware that Applicant had\nused an illegal drug on several occasions while he was pursuing his associate\u2019s\ndegree, believed it appropriate to view Applicant\u2019s drug use \u201cas a single event\u201d to be\nweighed against an otherwise solid career (Ex. D).\nIn the spring of 2009, Applicant was selected as one of a handful of individuals\nprivileged to attend a three-week training class in systems security (Ex. E). He has the\nsupport of supervisory personnel and colleagues, including his immediate and second-\nlevel supervisors, who have found his performance \u201cnothing less than stellar.\u201d (Exs. F,\nG, M, N). Applicant has not held a security clearance so he has accessed no classified\ninformation, but he has appropriately safeguarded the private information of more than\none thousand customers (Ex. F). In May 2009, Applicant received positive feedback for\nhis support during an academic accreditation assessment. The information resource\ndepartment was recognized for providing excellent service to the assessment team and\nthroughout the organization (Ex. K).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\n\n6\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n\n7\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant smoked marijuana with his brother on an estimated five or six times per\nyear from December 31, 2005, to December 31, 2007, while his brother lived with him.\nApplicant also took Vicodin that had not been prescribed for him in 2006 after he injured\nhis back helping his parents. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies.\nApplicant did not seek out the marijuana or the Vicodin. He used marijuana only\nwhen it was offered to him by his brother or his brother\u2019s friends with whom he was\nsocializing at the time, and his mother gave him the Vicodin which had been prescribed\nfor her. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d applies only in the\nlimited sense that Applicant can be said to have had physical custody or possession of\nthe drugs when he ingested them.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana and Vicodin may reasonably be characterized as\ninfrequent. However, his last involvement with marijuana is still relatively recent. His\ncase for mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is likely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is\nnot particularly persuasive.\nConcerning whether Applicant has demonstrated an intent to forego future drug\nabuse sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in\nthe future,\u201d he understood as of early 2008 that he could no longer use any marijuana if\nhe was to pursue employment with a defense contractor or with the government. Yet,\ndespite rocky relations with his brother and the stress his brother caused in the\nhousehold, Applicant allowed his brother to return to the house after he had evicted him.\nHe had made it clear to his brother that no illegal drugs would be tolerated at the house,\nbut at the same time, Applicant was aware that his brother and brother\u2019s friends were\nstill active drug users. As recently as August 2008, Applicant admitted to a government\ninvestigator that he was continuing to associate with his brother and brother\u2019s friends,\nwhom habitually used marijuana. As of November 2008, his brother was still residing in\nhis home, although by then his brother was spending less time there. By February 2009,\nApplicant\u2019s brother was in the process of moving out. He had all his belongings\nremoved from the premises by late March 2009. As of late June 2009, Applicant had\nlittle contact, if any, with his brother. Applicant has completely dissociated himself from\nhis brother\u2019s friends, but it is difficult to fully apply AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts,\u201d because of the fraternal relationship and the fact\nthat he has given his brother second chances in the past.\n\n8\nA demonstrated intent may also be shown by \u201cchanging or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used.\u201d (AG \u00b6 26(b)). Applicant\u2019s drug use took place in\nhis own home, but the environment has changed in that the opportunity to use illegal\ndrugs is no longer present since his brother moved out. Even before his brother\nvacated, Applicant had made it clear that his home was no longer an environment\nwhere drugs would be permitted. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies.\nIn February 2009, Applicant signed a statement of intent to refrain from drug\nabuse with the understanding that any violation would result in automatic revocation of\nhis security clearance. AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation,\u201d clearly applies, although it could mean little if\nunaccompanied by substantive changes reflective of a drug-free lifestyle. As Applicant\nentered his final semester in college, he resolved that marijuana use was incompatible\nwith his family\u2019s future. He completed his studies with a high academic average and\nthere is no evidence that he has used any illegal drugs since he went to work for a\ndefense contractor. It is debatable whether 18 months is \u201can appropriate period of\nabstinence\u201d (AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), given he used marijuana with his brother, in his own home,\nand despite the disapproval of his spouse. But he also passed two drug tests. He\nregrets his past drug use, and understands it is incompatible with his obligations to his\nemployer, the government, and his family. Recent medications for his insomnia and\nsleep apnea could pose a risk to his health if combined with marijuana, and his health is\na significant factor that makes him even less likely to abuse any drug in the future.\nBased on all the evidence, AG \u00b6 26(b) applies.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant showed poor judgment in using marijuana, even if it was limited to no\nmore than five or six times a year over a two-year span. While he apparently did not\nrealize that his misuse of his mother\u2019s Vicodin prescription was a problem, he knew that\n\n9\nhis marijuana use was \u201cwrong\u201d and incompatible with his obligations to his spouse and\nchildren. As Applicant became focused in his college studies and began to envision a\nfuture career in government or government contract work, he gave up his social use of\nmarijuana.  He has demonstrated maturity and reliability in the performance of his duties\non the military base since June 2008 to where his supervisors and colleagues are\nconfident that he can abide by the responsibilities of a security clearance. Based on all\nthe circumstances, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s financial considerations security\nconcern. Clearance is denied.\nOn February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 30, 2009, and admitted all of the\nallegations except SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.o. She requested a\nhearing, and the case was assigned to me on May 13, 2009. On June 4, 2009, a notice\nAugust 24, 2009\n\nSOR subparagraphs 1.d and 1.m are duplicates.\n1\n2\nof hearing was issued scheduling the case for June 23, 2009. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. I received five government exhibits, nine Applicant exhibits,\nand Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open at the end of the\nhearing for her to submit additional exhibits. She timely submitted six additional exhibits\nthat I incorporated into the record. The transcript was received on June 29, 2009.\nPreliminary Ruling\nAt the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel stipulated that Applicant\nsatisfied the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.o, totalling $4,563. I\nresolve these allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old single woman with no children. In 2004, she earned an\nassociate\u2019s degree in microcomputer technologies (Tr. 28). Before then, she had earned\napproximately a year and a half of credit toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in early childhood\ndevelopment. \nApplicant works for an information technology defense contractor specializing in\nnetwork security management. She travels to various military bases across the country\ninstalling computers and integrating systems information (Tr. 28). She has been working\nfor this employer since 2006 (Exhibit 1 at 10). She also does some independent\nconsulting for personal clients in her spare time (Tr. 33).\nBefore Applicant began working with her current employer, the majority of her\nprevious jobs were low-paying. She did not earn more than a minimum wage salary until\n2005 (Tr. 84). She had frequent periods of unemployment including three to four months\nin 2005, eight months in 2004, and four months in 2001 (Tr. 82, 90; Exhibit 1 at 18).\nHer employment outlook gradually stabilized after she earned the associate\u2019s\ndegree in 2004. Nevertheless, by 2008, she had accrued approximately $17,000 of\ndelinquent debt.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b are utility bills, collectively totalling\napproximately $580. Applicant accrued the debts after a roommate moved from their\nshared apartment without paying her portion of the bills (Tr. 70). \nSOR subparagraph 1.c, another utility, is a duplicate of 1.e (Exhibit B).\nApproximately $250 is outstanding.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.d  and 1.k are medical bills for different medical services\n1\nthat Applicant received from the same medical provider (Tr. 50). The amount due is\napproximately $500 (Tr. 67). Applicant consolidated the accounts, and is paying the\n\n3\ncreditor approximately $100 monthly (Tr. 67). The debts should be satisfied in five\nmonths.\nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f is a credit card account that is\ndelinquent in the approximate amount of $9,875. By February 2009, Applicant had\nnegotiated a settlement agreement and begun making sporadic monthly payments\n(Exhibit C at 5; Tr. 105). The current balance is $9,575 (Id.).\nThe record is unclear as to the identity of the creditors listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.i and 1.l. These bills total approximately $300. They remain unpaid.\nThe creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.n is a collection agent whom Applicant\nowes $951. The amount due constitutes the amount that Applicant had overdrawn on\nan old checking account, in addition to penalties (Tr. 93). On June 25, 2009, Applicant\nnegotiated a settlement agreement for $475 (Exhibit N). Under the payment plan,\nApplicant is to pay the creditor $40 monthly (Id.).\nIn January 2009, Applicant began consulting with a credit counselor (Tr. 70).\nWith the counselor\u2019s help, Applicant developed a budget and a payment plan (Exhibit\nE). Applicant has been satisfying the SOR debts under the plan. Specifically, Applicant\nhas started with the larger debts such as SOR subparagraph 1.f. When the larger debts\nare satisfied, she will then address the smaller ones such as SOR subparagraphs 1.i\nand 1.l (Tr. 70-72). Applicant has met with the credit counselor four times since their first\nmeeting (Tr. 70). At each session, they review Applicant\u2019s budget and discuss her day-\nto-day spending habits (Tr. 72). Applicant contends that naivete about debt contributed\nto the accrual of her delinquencies. With the help of the credit counselor, she now\nmanages money more responsibly (Tr. 105). \nCurrently, Applicant has satisfied approximately one-third of the debts listed in\nthe SOR. However, a car that Applicant leased was recently involuntarily repossessed\n(Tr. 93). She owes the creditor $10,000, the deficiency remaining from the resale (Tr.\n94; Exhibit 2 at 3). She has notified her credit counselor of this debt, and is negotiating a\nsettlement arrangement (Id.)\nApplicant earns approximately $2,115 of net monthly income. After expenses are\npaid, she has approximately $256 remaining (Tr. 104). She has been applying this\namount to the debts listed in the SOR (Id.). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were caused, in part, by her inability to find a\nsecure job. Also, a former roommate moved from a shared apartment, and did not pay\nher share of the bills. Applicant\u2019s job options improved after returning to school and\nearning an associate\u2019s degree. Also, she has consulted a credit counselor, organized\nher finances, and began satisfying her delinquencies. She has paid nearly a third of the\ndebt listed in the SOR.\nApplicant admits that lack of education about credit contributed to the accrual of\nher financial delinquencies. Also, the debts that she incurred when her roommate\nreneged on her joint responsibility to pay joint bills constituted only a small portion of\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not\napply.\n\n5\nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s efforts at rehabilitating her finances, including retaining\na credit counselor and developing a payment plan, are sufficient to trigger the\napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem . . . , and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThroughout the early part of this decade, Applicant struggled with low-paying,\nunstable jobs. Realizing that she was neither growing professionally, nor thriving\nfinancially, she returned to school and earned an associate\u2019s degree. As her\nemployment marketability improved, the quality of her jobs improved, enabling her to\nbegin satisfying her debts. The initiative she demonstrated weighs in her favor.\nApplicant also deserves credit for organizing her finances, seeking professional\ncredit advice, and implementing a payment plan. I am not convinced, however, that her\nfinances are under control. Although she organized a payment plan for one of her most\nsignificant debts (SOR subparagraph 1.f), she has made sporadic payments. Also,\nsince the issuance of the SOR, Applicant\u2019s automobile was repossessed. Consequently,\nApplicant\u2019s effort at rehabilitation constitutes a step in the right direction, but it is too\nsoon to conclude that her financial condition no longer poses a security concern.\nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is\nbased on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, as set forth in the\nDirective, to the evidence presented. Should Applicant be afforded the opportunity to\nreapply for a security clearance in the future, she may well demonstrate persuasive\nevidence of her security worthiness. Presently, however, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n6\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs1.g - 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i - 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 17, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated December 19, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on January 15, 2009, and \nthe case was assigned to Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross on January 22, 2009. It \nwas reassigned to me on January 23, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of \nHearing was issued on January 28, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on \nFebruary 10, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, seven Government exhibits and one Applicant exhibit were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on February 13, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and she is seeking \nto obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged. She previously \nheld a SECRET security clearance from about 1991 until 2002, while employed by \nanother defense contractor.1 With the exception of a period from February 2002 until \nApril 2005, when she was a stay-at-home homemaker, and a one month period in 2008, \nwhen she was laid off,2 Applicant has been gainfully employed since 1991. She has \nbeen employed by the same defense contractor, or a successor corporation, since May \n2008, and currently serves as an administrative assistant.3 \n \nApplicant was married in 2001, and divorced in 2005.4 She has one child, born in \n2001.5  \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated May 28, 2008), at 15, 27.  \n \n2 Id. at 12-13, 15. \n \n3 Id. at 12. \n \n4 Id. at 18. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nIn 1997, Applicant\u2019s debts, consisting primarily of credit card debt, were \ndischarged in bankruptcy under Chapter 7.6 Over subsequent years, Applicant, either \nindividually or jointly, has financed and purchased a number of family residences \nwithout difficulties. In July 2003, she received a $201,622 home mortgage from Chase. \nThat mortgage was paid until July 2004, when the account was closed as paid.7 \n \nIn November 2004, she applied for mortgage financing from Wachovia on a new \nresidence. Applicant and her boyfriend jointly applied because they were living together. \nHe was apparently not eligible, so the mortgage lender simply put the mortgage in her \nname, but using their combined salaries. She was advised by the lender that she could \nafford the type of mortgage they were offering her, provided it was broken down into a \nbasic adjustable rate 1st mortgage and a 2nd mortgage or home equity line of credit.8 \nShe put $50,000 down9 and secured a mortgage in the amount of $311,250 with an \naccompanying home equity or 2nd mortgage in the amount of $62,250, for a total of \n$373,500.10  \n \nApplicant dutifully paid her monthly mortgage without any difficulty for an \nunspecified period of time.11 At some point, that mortgage adjusted and her monthly \npayment increased. In an effort to hold her expenses down, Applicant refinanced her \nresidence with Countrywide in the amount of $356,000.12 The Wachovia mortgage was \nsatisfactorily paid off and the account was closed.13 \n \nIn January 2007, she refinanced her residence again, this time with \nHomecomings Financial, a subsidiary of GMAC, and received a fixed rate 1st mortgage \nin the amount of $360,000,14 and a 2nd mortgage in the amount of $67,500, with an \ninterest rate of 10.25 per cent.15 The Countrywide mortgage was satisfactorily paid off \n \n5 Id. at 21. \n \n6 Government Exhibit 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 19, 2005), at 2. \n \n7 Government Exhibit 3 (Combined Credit Report, dated July 1, 2008), at 5. \n \n8 Tr. at 27-28. \n \n9 Id. at 29. \n \n10 Id.  Applicant seemed to recall the purchase price of the home as $400,000, but the credit report indicates \nthe combined total of the two mortgages was actually $373,500.

The \ntaxes were supposed to be included in the escrow to be paid monthly, but because of \nan oversight on the part of the mortgage lender, the provision was not originally \nincluded.18 As a result of her complaint, the matter was \u201cstraightened out\u201d by the \nmortgage lender, but the result was a higher monthly payment for Applicant.19  The \nmonthly payment was increased from nearly $1,518 to nearly $3,076.20 \n \nAt some point, not otherwise specified, Applicant and her boyfriend split up and \nhe moved out of the residence.21 The loss of his rent contribution and the unanticipated \nhigher monthly payment made it more difficult for Applicant to maintain her payments \ncurrent. To do so, she withdrew money from her retirement account to make up the \ndeficit.22  She started to come up short, and distraught over the situation, discussed her \nalternatives with the mortgage lender.23 Aurora Loan, the new holder of the 1st \nmortgage, advised her to either sell the property at a pre-foreclosure or \u201cshort sale,\u201d or \nlet it go into foreclosure.24  After struggling with the increased payments for about two or \nthree months, she moved out of the house.25 \n \nIn mid-2008, Aurora Loan commenced the foreclosure process on the 1st \nmortgage, now totaling $363,000.26 At about the same time, Homecomings Financial \nplaced the 2nd mortgage, with a principal balance of $67,500 and an outstanding \nbalance of principal, interest, and late charges totaling nearly $6,393, into collection.27  \nThe residence has been vacant since she left.28 \n \n \n16 Government Exhibit 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 7, 2009), at 2. \n \n17 Tr. at 47-49. \n \n18 Id. at 48-49. \n \n19 Id. at 49-50. \n \n20 Government Exhibit 2 (Escrow Account Statement, dated July 1, 2008), supra note 15. \n \n21 Tr. at 32. \n \n22 Id. \n \n23 Id. at 33. \n \n24 Id. at 36. \n \n25 Id. at 32. \n \n26 Government Exhibit 7, supra note 16, at 3. \n \n27 Government Exhibit 2 (Account Statement, dated June 13, 2008), supra note 20. \n \n28 Tr. at 36-37. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n \nApplicant and her son now reside in a rental apartment.29  Her monthly net salary \nis $2,245, and after severely curtailing her monthly expenses down from $2,362 to \n$1,509, she has a net remainder of $1,821 for discretionary spending.30 With the \nexception of the purported mortgage deficiencies, all their other accounts and expenses \nare now current.31 \n \nThe SOR identified the two purportedly continuing mortgage deficiencies and an \nallegation that Applicant had a negative monthly net remainder. Those three allegations \nlisted in the SOR, and their respective purported current status, according the credit \nreports, financial records and correspondence, as well as Applicant\u2019s comments \nregarding same, are described below: \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTYPE DEBT OR ALLEGATION \nAMOUNT \nSTATUS \n1.a. \n1st mortgage \n$363,000 \nForeclosure process \n1.b. \n2nd mortgage \n$72,131 \nForeclosure process \n1.c. \nMinus monthly net remainder \n-$629 \nImprovement to +$1,821 \n \nApplicant has been characterized by current and former colleagues and \nsupervisors in extraordinarily favorable terms: organized, efficient, extremely competent, \nresponsible, reliable, dedicated, high integrity, trustworthy, well liked, self-motivated, \ngreat asset, \u201ccan do\u201d attitude, organized, and exhibits the highest standards of ethics \nand conduct.32 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \n                                                          \n29 Id. at 35. \n \n30 Personal Financial Statement, dated December 19, 2008, attached to Response to SOR.  In an effort to \nreduce her expenses, Applicant tightened her belt, ceased taking one medication, cancelled her house telephone, \nreduced cable television and utility expenses, reduced car expenses, and generally lowered her lifestyle to where she \nis \u201csurviving.\u201d \n \n31 Tr. at 41. \n \n32 Applicant Exhibit A (Character references and assorted Performance Review and Planning Forms, various \ndates). \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d33 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \n \n33 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns as well. The evidence is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \nAs noted above, with the exception of a period from February 2002 until April \n2005, when she was a stay-at-home homemaker, and a one month period in 2008, \nwhen she was laid off, Applicant has been gainfully employed since 1991. In 2004, she \nobtained financing for her residence, and subsequently refinanced it several more \ntimes, each time, hoping to lower her monthly mortgage payments. Each time she \napplied for a mortgage, Applicant presented her financial background as part of her \napplication for the mortgage loan. Unfortunately, a combination of circumstances \nsubsequently served her poorly, and she found her most recent 1st mortgage provisions \nin error (caused by the mortgage lender). When they were corrected, her monthly \npayments skyrocketed from nearly $1,518 to nearly $3,076. She was soon unable to \ncontinue to pay her monthly mortgage payments.  Unable to generate a pre-foreclosure \nor \u201cshort sale\u201d in the non-existent real estate market, she followed the mortgage lender\u2019s \nadvice and abandoned the residence to possible foreclosure. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nWhen \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., the loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d is also potentially mitigating under AG & 20(b). \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is \npotentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@34 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \n \n34 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply. \n \nAs noted above, the normal overriding concern pertaining to financial \nconsiderations in the security clearance context is that \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. . . .\u201d \n(emphasis supplied).  But these are not \u201cnormal\u201d times, for the world in general, and the \nUnited States in particular, is faced with economic chaos, plummeting real estate \nvalues, tightened credit, corporate layoffs and bankruptcies, diminished savings and \nretirement accounts, financial institution failures and takeovers, and soaring \nunemployment.  \n   \nWe no longer think in terms of millions or even billions of dollars when describing \ndeficits, for in this new world order, trillions of dollars have become the new standard.  \nWe are in economic turmoil, with posturing and corporate greed running rampant; where \ncredit is unavailable; where thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of otherwise \ninnocent bystanders have become victims by losing their homes to foreclosure and their \njobs to these uncertain times; and where the popular responses are to point the fingers \nof blame and throw unprecedented amounts of money, characterized as stimulus funds, \ninto the abyss with the hope of success.  \n   \nThis economic catastrophe appears to be the \u201cperfect storm\u201d where the \nconfluence of greed, irresponsible risk-taking, regulatory failure and inadequate \noversight, malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance on the part of some segments \nof corporate America, our financial institutions, and political institutions, has resulted in \nunintentional consequences or \u201ccollateral damage\u201d to the innocents.  In the past, these \nunconscionable actions were overlooked in the race for enrichment.   \n   \nTo determine if an applicant is such an unintentional victim or a willing participant \nand complicit, in an otherwise unwise or irresponsible monetary scheme, or a person \nwith poor self-control or lack of judgment, an analysis of the individual\u2019s original \nintentions and actions is essential. In this instance, since her 1997 bankruptcy, \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and actions reveals no evidence of poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or a willingness to abide by rules and regulations. To the contrary, her sole \ngoal was to obtain a mortgage with an affordable monthly payment, and when the \nmortgage payments adjusted upward, she refinanced to again obtain a lower monthly \n \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \npayment.  Her efforts were responsible and disciplined. Applicant\u2019s current situation was \ncaused by other factors, including an error by an apparently knowledgeable but \ncareless, and possibly unscrupulous, mortgage lender.  \n   \nIn January 2007, aware of Applicant\u2019s inability to pay the monthly mortgage \npayments to Homecomings Financial without the contributions of her boyfriend, that \ninstitution, nevertheless, appraised her residence and found she qualified for a \n$360,000 1st mortgage and a $67,000 2nd mortgage, although the real estate value of \nher home had already started to plummet. Rather than ignoring the facts, it should have \nanticipated the result.  It was evident that she could not afford the new mortgage, for \nshe did not lie or represent her financial status in her application for the mortgage. It \nwas seemingly another example of a disregard of lending guidelines. \n \nWhile the foreclosures are in the process, they are apparently on hold and have \nnot actually taken place, despite the residence being unoccupied for about one year. \nThis situation presents an interesting conundrum, for if the foreclosures do occur, under \nstate law, Applicant may not be liable for either the unpaid mortgages or the \ndeficiencies, and the lien holders would be limited to the property. Under California law, \nthere is a provision called the Anti-Deficiency Statute,35 which states in relevant part: \n \nNo deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property \nor an estate for years therein for failure of the purchaser to complete his or \nher contract of sale, or under a deed of trust or mortgage given to the \nvendor to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price of that real \nproperty or estate for years therein, or under a deed of trust or mortgage \non  a dwelling for not more than four families given to a lender to secure \nrepayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the \npurchase price of that dwelling occupied, entirely or in part, by the \npurchaser. \n \nUnder this section, generally if there is a foreclosure on a dwelling and there is a \ndeficiency, the lender has no recourse regarding \u201cpurchase money loans,\u201d also called \n\u201cnon-recourse loans,\u201d the amounts set forth in both the 1st and the 2nd mortgages used \nto finance the dwelling purchase. The collateral or dwelling is considered full \nsatisfaction. In addition, there is another pertinent law, called the One Form of Action \nRule,36 which states in relevant part: \n \nThere can be but one form of action for the recovery of any debt, or the \nperformance of any right secured by mortgage upon real property.  \n \nConsidering the unusual circumstances of today\u2019s economy in general, and the \nseries of events involving Applicant\u2019s mortgage loans in particular, Applicant\u2019s actions \nand her otherwise good financial status, there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s \n \n35 Cal.

The evidence \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e), and partially 20(b)37 because the \ncircumstances are unusual and unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant met with a mortgage \nlender at Homecomings Financial where she presented her financial background as part \nof her application for the mortgage loan. She, alone, was qualified for a particular loan, \neven though her boyfriend\u2019s salary was considered, and it was granted to her. She was \ntold the provisions of the instrument were identical to those in the Countrywide \nmortgage, and her monthly payments would be lower. However, she discovered there \nwas a problem when she received her first tax bill because the taxes were supposed to \nbe included in the escrow to be paid monthly, but because of an oversight on the part of \nthe mortgage lender, the provision was not included in this mortgage. The mortgage \nlender \u201cstraightened out\u201d the error, but the result was a higher monthly payment for \nApplicant, with the monthly payment increasing from nearly $1,518 to nearly $3,076. \n \nThe loss of her boyfriend\u2019s rent contribution and the unanticipated higher monthly \npayment made it more difficult for Applicant to maintain her payments so she withdrew \nmoney from her retirement account in an effort to make up the deficit. The new holder of \nthe 1st mortgage, advised her to either sell the property at a pre-foreclosure or \u201cshort \nsale\u201d or let it go into foreclosure.  After struggling with the increased payments for about \n \n37 For the purposes of my analysis, in this instance, I have considered both the tax escrow error of the \nlending institution, Applicant\u2019s split from her boyfriend and intended co-purchaser, and the general global economic \nproblems, to be such conditions which justify, at least, partial recognition. \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ntwo or three months, she moved out of the house. (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), 2(a)(5), \nand 2(a)(7).)  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether Applicant\u2019s mortgage debts are \nresolved; it is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to \nhold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, \nmight put Applicant\u2019s credit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various \naspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely \nperformed a piecemeal analysis.38 Considering the circumstances behind the mortgage \nloans given to her by the mortgage lenders, her employment history, her otherwise \noutstanding reputation, the decline in real estate values, and her continuing good-faith \nefforts, the security concerns are mitigated. (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(8), and 2(a)(9).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant timely answered the SOR, and\n2\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 2 October 2009, and I convened a\nhearing 28 October 2009. DOHA received the transcript 3 November 2009. \nSeptember 28, 2010\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 3.c. He is a 37-year-old\nsystems engineer employed by a defense contractor since December 2007. He seeks\nto retain the security clearance he first obtained while serving in the military.\nIn 1994, Applicant graduated from a prestigious engineering school with a degree\nin electrical engineering. In May 1994, he entered the military and served eight years on\nactive duty, and one year in the reserves. He held a clearance and handled classified\ninformation without incident while in the service. He married in January 1997 and has\ntwo children.\nIn October 2007, Applicant worked for another defense contractor, physically on-\nsite at the military command that contracted with his company. On 31 October 2007\nApplicant installed two unauthorized software programs on his unclassified government\ncomputer to bypass the firewall the command had installed to protect the computer\nsystem. By so doing, Applicant deliberately violated company regulations, industrial\nsecurity program regulations, and military agency regulations regarding information\ntechnology (IT) systems. Although, Applicant\u2019s government computer permitted internet\naccess, the agency firewall blocked access to some sites. Blocked sites included some\npopular web-based email sites that Applicant wanted to access. He researched the\ninternet for suitable programs, and downloaded two popular freeware programs to\nbypass the firewall. His system administrator privileges allowed him to install the\nsoftware.\n Applicant used the unauthorized software to tunnel through the agency firewall\nand access email and other sites that would otherwise have been blocked by the\nfirewall. The software allowed Applicant to access these sites through his home\ncomputer. He used the software for several days, usually connecting between his home\nand work computers when he got to work in the morning, and leaving the connection\nopen all day. According to Applicant, the software was uni-directional\u2014able to connect\nwork to home, but not home to work.\nAppellant\u2019s unauthorized activity came to light on 7 November 2007, when\nmilitary IT security personnel detected the tunneling activity between Applicant\u2019s work\nand home computers. They notified Applicant\u2019s command of the activity; but, in the\nmeantime, internet connectivity between the command and other organizations was\nshut down pending investigation of the potential security breach.\nIn response to a general inquiry begun by Applicant\u2019s command, on 8 November\n2007 he notified his internet administrator that he had been \u201cpinging\u201d his home\ncomputer from his workstation. His workstation was taken off the network. Applicant\nhoped this would be the end of the incident. When he realized that it would not be, on 9\nNovember 2007 he notified his supervisor that he had also loaded unauthorized\nsoftware on his work computer. The command suspended Applicant\u2019s access on 14\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n3\nNovember 2007, and his company fired him on 20 November 2007 because the\ncontract that employed him required him to have access.\nApplicant knew his conduct was unauthorized and violated command IT rules,\nbut did it anyway specifically to avoid the firewall. When the tunneling activity was\ndiscovered, Applicant deleted one of the programs because he was concerned about its\nbeing discovered. Later forensic examination of his work computer showed the two\nunauthorized programs, but also showed evidence of reformatting that suggested\nApplicant had acted to remove other incriminating evidence from his computer. The\nforensic examination concluded that no classified information was on Applicant\u2019s work\ncomputer.\nApplicant\u2019s work and character references consider him an outstanding\nemployee who is honest and trustworthy. His current co-workers consider him an\nexcellent employee, and believe he can be trusted with classified information. However,\nneither of them appears to be aware of the security concerns raised by the Government.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to be used to evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and\nsituation presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense\nconsideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case can be measured against\nthem, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline M (Use of Technology Systems), K\n(Handling Protected Information), and E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\n\n\u00b6 40. (b) illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation, or denial of access to information,\n4\nsoftware, firmware, or hardware in an information technology system; (c) use of any information technology\nsystem to gain unauthorized access to another system . . . ; (e) unauthorized use of a government or other\ninformation technology system; (f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software or\nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules,\nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations;\n\u00b6 34. (g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information;\n5\n\u00b6 16. (b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to [a] . . . security\n6\nofficial . . . or other official government representative; (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative\nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information; (d) credible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself\nfor an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information. . . ;\n4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline M, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant deliberately researched the\nmeans to avoid the command firewall, deliberately installed those means on his\ncommand computer, and then deliberately used those means to access sites the\nfirewall was intended to block.  He did this for his personal convenience. His misconduct\n4\nis recent, did not occur under unusual circumstances or work exigency, and was neither\nunintentional nor inadvertent. Consequently, none of the mitigating conditions apply.\nThe Government established case for disqualification under Guideline K, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Although, the computer system\nApplicant potentially compromised was the unclassified system at work, the rules\nApplicant violated were designed to protect the integrity of the computer system as a\nwhole and protect information which, if not classified, was potentially operationally\nsensitive.  Again, Applicant\u2019s misconduct is recent, did not occur under unusual\n5\ncircumstances, and was not due to improper or inadequate training. Arguably, Applicant\ndemonstrated the same positive attitude (contemplated by the mitigating factors) toward\ndischarge of security responsibilities before and after the misconduct. Consequently,\nnone of the mitigating conditions apply.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. When Applicant\u2019s breach of the\ncomputer system was first discovered, he was not fully candid with government security\nofficials. Not until it became clear that the incident was not going to die down on its own\ndid he disclose the full extent of his misconduct.  Although his misconduct was\n6\ninfrequent, it was recent, not minor, and did not occur under unusual circumstances. His\nmisconduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, and\n\n5\ndespite his claims that he will never do it again, it seems as likely than not that it will.\nFurther, Applicant was over 35 years old when this misconduct began, hardly an age\nwhere the conduct might be attributed to youthful indiscretion. I resolve Guideline E\nagainst Applicant.\nAlthough this case is alleged under Guidelines M, K, and E, its core is a whole-\nperson analysis. Despite the recommendation of his work and character references,\nApplicant\u2019s poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness argues against a whole\nperson analysis in his favor. He planned his misconduct and used his technical skill and\nfiduciary position to execute his misconduct. He did so for his own personal\nconvenience, not for any business or government exigency, and then tried to keep the\nfull extent of his misconduct from government representatives. In effect, Applicant used\nhis position of trust to engage in conduct he was expressly hired to not engage in. He is\nnot suitable for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing   \n(e-QIP) on August 14, 2008. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                \nOn August 21, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \n \nApplicant signed his notarized Answer on October 7, 2009. He admitted both \nallegations under Guideline H and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 6, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on November 16, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December \n11, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 6, 2010. Government \ncounsel offered two exhibits, which I admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of two witnesses. He \nalso offered five exhibits. I marked and admitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D. \nDepartment Counsel objected to parts of AE E. I admitted AE E, reserving my decision \non its weight. DOHA received the transcript on January 13, 2009. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E is a report from a private polygrapher that contained the \nfollowing: the polygrapher\u2019s description of Applicant's pre-polygraph interview, listing his \nquestions to Applicant and Applicant's responses (pages 1 and 2); the polygrapher\u2019s \nopinion as to Applicant's truthfulness (page 2); results of Applicant's polygraph (page 3); \nApplicant's identifying information (page 4); polygrapher\u2019s license (page 5); \npolygrapher\u2019s curriculum vitae (pages 6 - 13); and the polygrapher\u2019s identification card \n(page 14).  \n \nDepartment Counsel objected to the portion of page 2 that contains the \npolygrapher\u2019s opinion as to Applicant's truthfulness; and to page 3, the technical results \nof the polygraph. The Appeal Board has held that an applicant\u2019s statements made \nduring the course of a polygraph examination are admissible, while polygraph results \nand the polygrapher\u2019s opinion of a subject\u2019s veracity are not admissible.3 Accordingly, I \nassign no weight to that portion of page 2 containing the polygrapher\u2019s opinion of \nApplicant's truthfulness, and no weight to the polygraph results on page 3. As to the \nremainder of the exhibit, I found that the admissible portions did not substantively \ncontribute to the case, and accorded them little weight. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n3 See ISCR Case No. 02-31428 (App. Bd.

This is his first application for a security \nclearance. (GE 1; Tr. 49-50) \n \nApplicant stated in his Answer that he used ecstasy at a friend\u2019s house between \n2000 and 2002. In his Answer and at the hearing, he stated that it occurred \u201cin what I \nbelieve was 1999.\u201d He adjusted the date because he realized he used it during \nvacation, before he graduated college in December 1999. This was the only time he \nused Ecstasy. (GE 2; AE A; Tr. 78-79) \n \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant listed five uses of marijuana \nbetween 1999 and 2008. In his Answer and at the hearing, he clarified that he was \nexposed to marijuana five times, but only smoked it himself on three of those occasions. \nIn 1999 and in the spring of 2001, Applicant was exposed to marijuana when he was \ndriving with friends. He stated that he did not use marijuana himself on either of these \noccasions, and no longer associates with these friends. In the summer of 2001, while at \na beach party, Applicant accepted an offer to \u201ctake a drag from the bong.\u201d He stated in \nhis Answer that, \u201cThis was actually the first time I ever inhaled.\u201d In 2002, while on a \ncruise, he shared a marijuana cigarette that was passed among his friends. He did not \nknow the man who offered him the cigarette, and he has not seen him since then. His \nlast use of marijuana occurred in July 2008. Applicant was at a friend\u2019s house preparing \nto leave for a kickball game. He was offered a joint and accepted it, taking one \u201cdrag.\u201d \nHe has not seen this friend since the winter of 2008. (AE A; Tr. 49-58)  \n \nApplicant denies purchasing or selling either marijuana or ecstasy. He used \nmarijuana in response to peer pressure. His employer and his parents are aware of his \ndrug use. Applicant has not participated in drug counseling or a drug treatment \nprogram, but was evaluated by a drug counselor in November 2009. He took three drug \ntests, administered by prospective employers, all of which were negative. He no longer \nassociates with any of the friends with whom he used drugs. Applicant has had no \ninvolvement with law enforcement related to illegal drug use. He disclosed his drug use \non his security clearance application, during his security interview, and in his \ninterrogatory responses. He admits that he made bad decisions when he decided to use \nillegal drugs. He has no intent to use illegal drugs in the future. He submitted a signed \nstatement declaring this intent, aware that future use could result in revocation of any \nsecurity clearance that he is granted. (GE 1, 2; AE A, D; Tr. 28-47, 62-63, 87-88) \n \n\n \n \n4 \n                                                \n \nApplicant's current supervisor testified on Applicant's behalf. He has supervised \nApplicant since April 2009. Applicant informed him of his drug use in approximately \nAugust 2009. He has never seen Applicant under the influence of drugs or alcohol. \nApplicant's performs well at his job. His supervisor finds him reliable and trustworthy, \nand recommends him for a security clearance. (Tr. 19-25) \n \n \nIn November 2009, Applicant contacted a drug counselor to obtain an evaluation. \nAt the hearing, the counselor offered his professional opinion of Applicant's current drug \nstatus.4 The witness holds a master\u2019s degree in counseling, and has been a state-\nlicensed professional counselor since 1997. He is a nationally certified master addiction \ncounselor, and is certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a substance \nabuse professional. He has been in practice 12 years. He is also the director of an \noutpatient mental health and substance abuse practice. He conducted an in-depth \ninterview of Applicant, a urinalysis, and substance-abuse testing. He found that \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use stemmed from curiosity and peer pressure. Applicant's \nconduct does not meet the definition of either drug abuse or dependence, as defined by \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Based on his evaluation, he concluded \nthat there is \u201ca very low probability of [Applicant] using again\u201d in the future. (Tr. 28-47) \n \n \nApplicant's project manager, who has known Applicant for two years, submitted a \nnotarized affidavit in which he stated that Applicant has never shown any indication of \nillegal drug use. Applicant informed him of his drug use when they both submitted \nsecurity clearance applications in 2008. The affiant noted that Applicant has been \ndiscrete in his handling of sensitive information. He believes Applicant to be honest and \ntrustworthy. Applicant's former project manager, who has also known Applicant for two \nyears, submitted a notarized affidavit stating that Applicant informed him in 2008 of his \nillegal drug use. As the witness holds a security clearance, he is aware of the \nresponsibility to report risks posed by others. He believes Applicant to be honest and \ntrustworthy, and has never seen him engage in questionable behavior. (AE B, C).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised AG.5 \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of \nthe Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \n \n4 Department Counsel had no objection to the witness\u2019s qualifications to provide an expert opinion. (Tr. \n40) \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n5 \n                                                \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement). \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nOf the eight disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 25, the following are relevant:  \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \nApplicant did not purchase illegal drugs, but admits illegally using marijuana and \nEcstasy. He used Ecstasy once, and marijuana between 3 and 5 times from 1999 to \n2008. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use demonstrated poor judgment and willingness to \nbreak the law. Both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 includes three mitigating conditions that warrant consideration in \nrelation to these facts:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, \nsuch as:  \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused;  \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare \nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n \n \nApplicant used ecstasy one time in approximately 1999. I consider this use \ndistant in time and experimental. He used marijuana three to five times in nine years, \nbetween the years of 1999 and 2008. I find this use to be infrequent. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he ended his marijuana use in July 2008, one-and-one-half years ago. \nSince 2007, he has been working steadily at a full-time, professional position. \nAccording to his supervisor, he is performing responsibly, and is trustworthy and \ndependable. These facts support a finding of current trustworthiness and reliability. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \nMitigation is also available under AG \u00b6 26(b) (1), (3) and (4). Applicant no longer \nassociates with the friends with whom he used drugs. He has abstained from illegal \ndrugs for approximately one-and-one-half years. This is not an extensive period of \nabstinence, but in light of the other favorable factors, it is an additional positive \nindication of his commitment to avoid illegal drugs. The drug tests administered by \nthree prospective employers were negative. In addition, Applicant submitted a \nstatement that he will not use illegal drugs in the future, with the understanding that any \nuse would jeopardize his security clearance. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \n \n \nPartial mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition \ninvolves completion of a drug treatment program, which does not apply to Applicant. \nHowever, it warrants discussion because Applicant did undergo an evaluation by a \nqualified medical professional. In the expert opinion of the drug counselor, Applicant \ndoes not meet the DSM criteria for drug abuse or drug dependence, and has a very \nlow probability of using illegal drugs in the future. I consider his testimony to be a \nfavorable prognosis. Mitigating condition 26(d) applies in part.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the guideline in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant used Ecstasy once between eight and ten years ago. He used \nmarijuana three to five times. Most of the marijuana use occurred between 1999 and \n2002, with a single use in 2008. Most of his illegal drug use is distant in time. Although \nhis 2008 use is more recent; and does not represent an extensive period of abstinence, \nI evaluate it in conjunction with his other conduct: his dissociation from his drug-using \nassociates, his supervisor and co-workers\u2019 opinions of his trustworthiness, his intent to \n\n \n \n8 \navoid future use, and the expert\u2019s opinion of a very low likelihood of recurrence. \nApplicant demonstrated maturity by realizing that he made poor decisions when he \nused illegal drugs, and by fully disclosing his drug use during the security clearance \nprocess. He now holds a responsible, full-time job where he has performed dependably \nfor more than two years. His conduct reflects positively on his current trustworthiness.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. for all these reasons, I conclude applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the drug involvement guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant denied allegation \u00b6 3.a.   \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1971. She is divorced and has four children (Tr. 104). She has worked in\na professional capacity for more than 30 years. She has been with her current employer\nsince April 2008 (GE 1).\nApplicant admits using crack cocaine in 1987 until at least November 1988. She\nwas divorcing her husband after an abusive marriage in 1987, and this was a stressful\ntime in her life. She was befriended by a coworker who introduced her to crack cocaine\n(Tr. 105). Applicant and her friend used the illegal drug on weekends. She admits an\nimmediate addiction to cocaine (Tr. 108).\nThe coworker with whom Applicant used cocaine was embezzeling money from\ntheir employer. Applicant was recruited into a fraudulent scheme. Applicant also began\nto write checks and submitted false, fictitious, and fraudulent claims for medical and\nhealth insurance benefits. She obtained payments from checks she cashed (GE 6).  \nApplicant was arrested in November 1988, and charged with conspiracy to\ncommit embezzlement from an employee benefit plan, a felony (GE 5). She pleaded\nguilty and was sentenced to five years supervised probation, drug and alcohol\ncounseling, and restitution in the amount of $27,934 (GE 4). The reason she stole from\nher employer was she said she needed this money to support her crack cocaine\naddiction. She was cooperative with the criminal investigation, and agreed to testify\nagainst two coworkers who were involved in the thefts (Tr. 110).\nIn November 1988, Applicant sought intensive outpatient treatment and was\ndiagnosed as a crack-cocaine addict. Applicant attended approximately 32 weeks of\ngroup counseling (GE 7). She attended some Alcohol Anonymous (AA) groups for\nwomen, although Applicant did not have a problem with alcohol. There were few\nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) groups available at the time and Applicant needed to attend\na support group for her recovery (Tr. 116). \nIn June 1990 until at least April 1991, Applicant received care from a\npsychologist for her drug addiction. She attended 36 psychotherapy sessions (GE 8).\nThe therapist reports that she was motivated to remain drug-free. She was extremely\n\n3\nconscientious in her attendance. The therapist initially described Applicant as insecure\nand prone to have relationships with men who treat her badly, abuse her, or take\nadvantage of her. In his report, the therapist noted that Applicant\u2019s involvement with the\nfraudulent scheme was a function of her basic personality structure, combined with\nimpaired judgment secondary to cocaine use. The therapist was optimistic she would\nremain drug free because she opined that Applicant is a moral, responsible person.\nFrom 2000 until at least May 2007, Applicant admits using marijuana. She was\ndating someone who was growing marijuana (Tr. 127). She smoked the illegal drug\nwhen he brought it to her house. She was arrested in May 2007, when the police\ndiscovered a small amount of marijuana that she had in her vehicle (Tr. 128). She\ndecided at that point not to use it any longer. She had concerns about health issues.\nShe no longer associates with her boyfriend who was using marijuana (Tr. 131).\nApplicant was in her car and was stopped at a routine police checkpoint in 2007.\nHer son was driving the car but when he saw the checkpoint ahead, he told Applicant\nhe did not have a driver\u2019s license and he was scared he would get into trouble. She\ndecided to switch to the driver\u2019s seat (Tr. 133). When the police stopped the car, they\nsmelled marijuana. She told the police that there was some in her backpack (Tr. 133).\nShe also had an open container in the vehicle. Applicant had a bottle of whiskey that\nhad been opened (GE 2). She took it from her home for the trip but had not consumed\nany in the car.\nAs a result of the May 2007 arrest, Applicant was charged with (1) possession\nmarijuana, (2) possession paraphernalia, and (3) open container. She pleaded guilty\nand was sentenced to four days in jail, placed on one year of probation, ordered to\nattend a drug and alcohol awareness course and fined (GE 2). Applicant successfully\ncompleted her probation in May 2008. \nIn June 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator (GE 2). The investigator questioned her about the May 2007 arrest\nconcerning marijuana and the open container charge. Applicant discussed her\ntreatment from May 2007. She was not questioned about any other incidents (Tr. 157).\nShe was candid and forthcoming during the interview.\nIn February 2009, Applicant completed a set of DOHA interrogatories (GE 3).\nShe disclosed her use of cocaine in 1988, and her subsequent treatment program. She\nalso listed the 2007 arrest for possession of marijuana and the disposition of the case.\nShe acknowledged that she drinks alcohol but only once in a while. She stated that she\ndoes not drink to the point of intoxication. She elaborated that she submits to random\ndrug or alcohol testing at work.\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that she has never received therapy or\ntreatment for alcohol abuse or dependency. She tried to retrieve records from the\ntreatment center to prove that she was treated for her crack-cocaine addiction and not\nfor alcohol. She was credible in her testimony that she has never had any problems with\nalcohol. Her current alcohol use is minimal at best. She does not drink by herself (Tr.\n\n4\n136). Applicant also testified credibly that she has not drunk alcohol to intoxication since\n1999 (Tr. 138). She explained that she was shocked to see allegations about alcohol\nabuse on the SOR. Other than the open container issue in 2007, Applicant had no legal\nproblems or personal problems with alcohol.\nApplicant\u2019s brother testified that Applicant worked for him in 2007. Applicant\u2019s\nbrother, a physician with training in alcohol counseling and treatment, believes that\nApplicant does not have any alcohol consumption problems. She lived with his family for\nsometime, and he describes her as a social drinker (Tr. 43). He never discussed\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use with her (Tr. 41). \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law describes Applicant as trustworthy. She has never\nobserved a problem with Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol in the social setting or in her home.\nShe trusts Applicant to watch her children (Tr. 59).\nApplicant\u2019s former senior manager/supervisor testified by telephone on behalf of\nApplicant. He describes Applicant as one of the most reliable people on his team.\nApplicant worked for him in the 1990s. He is trained in areas of drug recognition in the\nworkplace and has never observed any indication of a problem with alcohol.\nA coworker who has known Applicant for 25 years describes Applicant as\nreliable. She had no knowledge of Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine or marijuana. She\nsocialized with Applicant and never saw any alcohol consumption problems (Tr. 93).\nA current coworker describes Applicant as a dedicated and diligent worker, who\nis an outstanding performer (Tr. 98). He had training while in the military concerning\ndrug and alcohol abuse. He has never seen any indication of such problems. He has\nobserved Applicant in social settings and saw her have one drink. He recommends\nApplicant for a clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor describes Applicant as a hard worker. He has\nnever observed any problems with Applicant. He describes her drinking as \u201csocial.\u201d He\nrecommends her for a security clearance (Tr. 53).\nIn 2009, Applicant was evaluated by a psychiatrist who testified as an expert\nwitness at her hearing. The psychiatrist saw Applicant over a three-month period (Tr.\n19). Applicant received a clinical evaluation. He also made multiple phone contacts with\nApplicant on a random basis. The psychiatrist found Applicant rehabilitated as to the\ncocaine use. He also opined that Applicant did not have any signs of alcohol abuse (Tr.\n38). In fact, he was emphatic that, in his professional opinion, she has never had any\nissue with alcohol abuse. He gave a diagnosis of adjustment reaction with anxiety and\ndepression (Tr.73). \nThe expert testified that he was not concerned about the open container in her\ncar in 2007. She was not drinking, she was not stopped due to erratic driving, and there\nwas no sign that she had used alcohol earlier in the day.\n\n5\nAccording to the expert, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was casual. He did not\nbelieve it was addictive for Applicant because she only used it with her boyfriend. She\nspent time in jail, and he believes that she clearly does not want to use it again. He\nbelieves sufficient time has passed to say that, with a high degree of certainty, she is\nnot likely to use marijuana again. Nor does he recommend any treatment. He also\nelaborated on the fact that the security clearance process is stressful and Applicant has\nnot shown any signs of reverting to any illegal drug at this time. \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations consistently rate her as meeting\nexpectations. She exceeds expectations in a few areas (AE B). She has successfully\ncompleted 27 training courses (AE A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\n\nAG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner\n1\nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including:\n2\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled\nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants,\nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substance. See Sch. I(c)(9). See also Gonzales v.\nRaish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford,\n449 F.3d 860, 861 (8  Cir. 2006). Cocaine is a Sch. II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine).\nth\n6\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@  is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\n1\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.2\nApplicant admitted her use of marijuana in varying amounts and frequency spanning a\nperiod from about 2000 until May 2007 when she was arrested. She also admitted using\ncrack-cocaine in 1987 and 1988. \nUnder \u00b6 AG 25(d) \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence\u201d and\nAG 25(e) \u201cevaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social\nworker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program\u201d, are applicable.\n\n7\nApplicant received intensive outpatient treatment for an addiction to crack cocaine from\n1988 until 1991. She attended NA groups during that time. These disqualifying\nconditions apply in this case.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ There are no\nbright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. The determination must be\nbased on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record. If the evidence shows a\nsignificant period has passed without evidence of misconduct, then the administrative\njudge considers whether that period demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct\nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. \nApplicant=s last illegal drug use was in May 2007, when she was arrested for the\npossession of marijuana. She was a mature adult. She used marijuana as a result of the\ninfluence of her then boyfriend. She smoked the marijuana for almost seven years on a\nweekly basis. She had not used any other illegal drug since the cocaine in 1988. She\nhad already received treatment for crack-cocaine addiction. She had attended NA\nmeetings and was aware of the issues involved in illegal drug use. She was yet again\ninfluenced by someone to use an illegal substance. This shows poor judgment and lack\nof trustworthiness. \nUnder all the circumstances, security concerns cannot be alleviated without the\npassage of more time and because doubts about her current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment are not sufficiently resolved. Despite her good intentions, Applicant\nended her marijuana use in May 2007 when she was arrested. Her motivations to stop\nusing illegal drugs are evident. She understands the adverse effects from drug abuse.\nShe successfully completed one drug program and did not use any illegal substance for\nseveral years. However, she has not shown a sufficient track record of refraining from\nmarijuana use to authorize her access to classified information.  \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d \n\n8\nApplicant was charged with possession of an open container of alcohol in her\nvehicle in May 2007. This is the only incident involving alcohol. Applicant drinks on a\nsocial basis. She does not drink to the point of intoxication. She has never received a\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. She was credible that she was never treated\nfor abuse of alcohol. Applicant has taken responsibility for her past excessive alcohol\nconsumption.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has an outstanding work record spanning 30 years. She is\nrecommended for her fine work. She had a single, isolated alcohol-related incident. It is\nunlikely to recur. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption concerns under AG \u00b6\n23(a). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n9\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 16(a), a disqualifying condition exists when there is\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 16(b), a disqualifying condition exists when \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d\nApplicant was credible that she did not mislead the investigator in her interview in 2008.\nThe investigator asked her questions about her use of marijuana and the 2007 arrest.\nShe did not avoid any discussion of her cocaine use or treatment 20 years ago. She\nwas candid and forthcoming. She did not falsify any material facts regarding treatment\nor counseling. AG \u00b6 16(a) and (b) do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that they are not\nsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. She has a good employment record. She received treatment for crack\ncocaine and never used this illegal drug after her treatment in 1991. She disclosed her\nuse of crack cocaine and her use of marijuana from 2000 until 2007. She stopped using\nmarijuana in May 2007. She is a hard worker who has raised her family as a single\nparent. She is loyal to the United States. There is no proof that Applicant used any\n\n10\nillegal drugs at work. She was credible in her statement that she would not use\nmarijuana in the future. \nApplicant used crack cocaine with a coworker in 1987 and 1988. This led to\ninvolvement with an embezzeling scheme to defraud her employer. She cooperated\nwith the authorities but was convicted of conspiracy to defraud. She decided to use\nmarijuana in 2000 with her boyfriend who grew the illegal substance. She was again\ninfluenced to use an illegal drug after many years. She used marijuana at least once a\nweek for a period of seven years. She was arrested in May 2007 for possession of\nmarijuana. She has not received any drug treatment for her marijuana use. Her poor\njudgment placed her at risk and she had a misdemeanor level conviction for possession\nof marijuana and drug paraphernalia.\nIn conclusion, I am impressed with Applicant\u2019s sincerity and commitment to\nrefrain from using illegal drugs. If she continues to abstain from illegal drug use, and\navoids any other conduct that raises a security concern, a security clearance might be\neventually approved for her.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the fact and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug involvement at this time. Overall, the record\nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment,\nand suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant, who is 23 years old, started working for a Department of Defense contractor on June 30, 2008 as a business development analyst. Her current supervisor praises her work skills, honesty, and integrity. She advises that Applicant\u2019s hiring drug screen was negative. 1 Applicant graduated from high school in 2004 and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business marketing. She is single and currently lives with her parents.2 When Applicant completed her e-QIP, she acknowledged using marijuana between 2003 and 2008. Applicant began experimenting with marijuana while a high school student. Her high school boyfriend asked her if she wanted to smoke marijuana. She decided to try it. She smoked marijuana with him twice. When she ended this relationship, she continued to smoke marijuana occasionally at the homes of friends.3 In college, Applicant increased her marijuana usage. As a freshman, she smoked marijuana four or five times a month, usually with her roommate, who was also her best friend. She stated that they smoked marijuana to ease boredom and for entertainment.

The Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing security concerns under Guideline H on March 17, 2009. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJuly 29, 2009\n\nGE 1; AE B; Tr. 22-23.\n1\nGE 1; Tr. 22-23.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 24.\n3\nTr. 24-26, 33.\n4\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 24, 2009. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 10, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. DOHA received the request on April 13, 2009. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on May 14, 2009, and I received the case assignment on May 15,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 27, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on June 18, 2009. The government offered two exhibits (GE) 1 and 2,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one\nwitness testified on her behalf. She submitted two exhibits (AE) A and B, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on June 18,\n2009. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. She also provided additional information to\nsupport her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant, who is 23 years old, started working for a Department of Defense\ncontractor on June 30, 2008 as a business development analyst. Her current supervisor\npraises her work skills, honesty, and integrity. She advises that Applicant\u2019s hiring drug\nscreen was negative.  \n1\nApplicant graduated from high school in 2004 and received a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin business marketing. She is single and currently lives with her parents.2\nWhen Applicant completed her e-QIP, she acknowledged using marijuana\nbetween 2003 and 2008. Applicant began experimenting with marijuana while a high\nschool student. Her high school boyfriend asked her if she wanted to smoke marijuana.\nShe decided to try it. She smoked marijuana with him twice. When she ended this\nrelationship, she continued to smoke marijuana occasionally at the homes of friends.3\nIn college, Applicant increased her marijuana usage. As a freshman, she smoked\nmarijuana four or five times a month, usually with her roommate, who was also her best\nfriend. She stated that they smoked marijuana to ease boredom and for entertainment.\nDuring her sophomore and junior years of college, Applicant increased her marijuana\nusage to eight to ten times a month. In her senior year of college, she began decreasing\nher marijuana usage as she was moving into the job market and away from her college\nlife. She last used marijuana on May 8, 2008 with her then boyfriend to celebrate the\ncompletion of college.4\n\nResponse to SOR attachment; Tr. 26, 34.       \n5\nTr. 26-27, 30.\n6\nId. at 27\u201328, 31-32.\n7\nId. 17-20.\n8\nAE A.\n9\n3\nApplicant has no intent to use marijuana in the future because the school\nenvironment is different from her present environment. She describes her marijuana use\nas a phase in school life. She has no plans to revisit that part of her life. Her career and\nher family are her current focus. On April 10, 2009, she signed an automatic revocation\nletter should she violate the Directive.5\nFriends or her college boyfriend provided most of the marijuana she smoked.\nOccasionally, she provided her boyfriend with money to purchased marijuana for their\nuse. She did not actually purchase any marijuana from any drug dealer. She never used\nany other illegal drugs. When offered other illegal drugs, she said \u201cno\u201d and left the\nroom.6\nApplicant denied habitual use of marijuana when she completed her e-QIP. Upon\nreflection at the hearing, she acknowledged that she habitually used marijuana in\ncollege. Her college boyfriend is no longer in her life. Except for her best friend, she no\nlonger associates with her college friends who used marijuana. Her best friend no\nlonger smokes marijuana.7\nA friend testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant\u2019s good friend since seventh\ngrade opined that Applicant is a very honest and trustworthy person with good integrity.\nHer friend knew about Applicant\u2019s marijuana use in college and high school. She also\nknew that Applicant had not used marijuana since the spring of 2008. She stated that\nApplicant had her priorities straight and would not use marijuana after college. Because\nthey are good friends, she knew Applicant no longer used marijuana.  \n8\nAnother very long-time friend wrote a letter of recommendation on behalf of\nApplicant. She described Applicant as honest and candid. She stated Applicant does\nnot lie, even when knowing negative consequences can occur for telling the truth.\nApplicant is a supportive, kind, and caring friend.9\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n10\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE3.1.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n10\n\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a Peoples Republic of China\nrelated Applicant, and then decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why\ncredibility determinations and ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to\nthe judge who makes witness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11\n(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse\nhearing-level judicial decisions and recommending remand of cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and\nISCR Case No. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is\nrequired. See United States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318\nF.3d 242, 247-248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va.\n2003)(explaining standard of review).\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n\n6\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances.\n(b) Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nApplicant used marijuana, an illegal drug, throughout her college years and\noccasionally in high school. Appellant gave her boyfriend money to purchase marijuana,\nbut did not actually purchase it herself.  Because she smoked marijuana, she\npossessed it. The government has established its case under these disqualifying\nconditions.\nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\nApplicant no longer associates with her college boyfriend and her college friends\nwith whom she generally used marijuana, except for her best friend. She is no longer in\nthe college environment, but living at home with her parents and working in the\nbusiness world, where marijuana use is not part of her everyday environment. She has\nnot used marijuana in more than 13 months and does not intend to use it in the future.\nHer best friend also stopped using marijuana after college. Finally, she signed a\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of a clearance for any violation. She\nchanged her lifestyle and looks forward to developing her career in the business world.\nShe does not feel the need to spend her time smoking marijuana. She has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6 26(b). Because she has changed her daily\n\n7\nenvironment from college student life to the business world, her college use of\nmarijuana is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) has some applicability.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. As a high\nschool student, Applicant experimented with smoking marijuana on a few occasions.\nWhen she entered college, she began smoking marijuana on a more regular basis,\nsometimes out of boredom. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) As a college senior, Applicant decided\nto reduce her marijuana use and to quit upon graduation. She realized that she would\nbe entering the business world and this conduct needed to cease. She showed maturity\nby making this decision. She no longer associates with most of her college friends as\ntheir lives and residences are different. She continues to spend time with her best\nfriend, who also stopped smoking marijuana now that she is out of college. Applicant\nalso signed the automatic revocation, knowing that she can lose her clearance and job if\nshe returns to smoking marijuana, another sign of her maturity. Her testimony about her\ndecision to stop smoking marijuana and to focus on her career and family is credible.\nShe made decisions in college which brought her to a hearing. She, however, has made\n\n8\nimportant decisions in the short time since her college graduation which reflect a good\nlevel of maturity and a move in the proper direction for the rest of her life.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her past drug use. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 29, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 13, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge ignored record evidence\n\nfavorable to Applicant and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a technical order librarian for a Defense contractor.  She\nretired from the Air Force after twenty years of service, and she has worked as a contractor ever\nsince.  She has held a security clearance since the beginning of her Air Force career, without incident\nor concern.  Applicant\u2019s husband is also retired from the Air Force.  He worked in the airline\nindustry, suffering a diminution in salary following the September 11, 2001, attacks.  He currently\nperforms maintenance work.\nAt the time they married, Applicant\u2019s husband had significant debts.  The couple have\nresolved his debts, though in doing so they neglected Applicant\u2019s.  In addition, Applicant and her\nhusband have provided financial assistance to their daughter, who was raising children. \nApplicant herself has significant delinquent debts, for such things as a car repossession,\nmedical bills, and commercial credit accounts.  Although she has paid off some of her debts, the\nJudge concluded that the remaining ones posed security concerns which Applicant had failed to\nmitigate.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge ignored evidence which, she believes, demonstrates that\nshe had resolved her medical bills.  She believes that the Judge substituted an unfavorable opinion\nfor record evidence.  We have examined the Judge\u2019s detailed discussion of Applicant\u2019s medical\ndebts.  We find no basis to conclude that her findings on these matters were not based upon\nsubstantial record evidence.  Furthermore, the conclusions which she drew from these findings were\nreasonable, principally that the record did not explain the circumstances underlying many of these\ndebts.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met her burden of persuasion as to mitigation,\nwhich was a reasonable interpretation of the record.  \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008).  In this case, the Judge discussed evidence which tended to show that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were, to a certain extent, a result of circumstances outside her control, and that several of\nher debts had been satisfied, either by having been paid off or having been forgiven by the creditors.\nHowever, she also provided a reasonable explanation for her conclusion that Applicant had failed\nto demonstrate a track record of debt repayment or otherwise mitigate the remaining debts.  \nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on May 23, 2008. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F\non May 29, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 4, 2009. She answered the\nSOR in writing on June 20, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nJanuary 13, 2010\n\nApplicant and Department Counsel marked the additional submissions as 1 through 10. I have marked these\n1\ndocuments to be consistent with Applicant exhibits admitted at the hearing. Number 1 has been remarked as\nAE D. Numbers 2 through 10 are remarked as AE H through AE P. I marked the November 17, 2009 credit\nreport as AE Q. \nW hen  SOR allegations are denied, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient to\n2\nprove them. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the government must establish by\nsubstantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took place. Second, the government\nmust establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and events and a legitimate security\nconcern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd.

Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on August 31, 2009, and I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 25, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on October 20, 2009. The government offered six\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and\none witness testified. Applicant submitted seven exhibits (AE) A through G. Except for\nAE D, her exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 29, 2009. I held the record open until\nNovember 19, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters and to obtain copies of\nAE D. Applicant timely submitted 10 additional documents and copies of AE D.  AE D\n1\nand AE H through AE Q are admitted without objection. The record closed on\nNovember 19, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.c, 1.bb, and 1.cc of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the remaining factual\nallegations in the SOR.  She also argued that many of the debts listed in the SOR are\n2\nbarred from collection under the statute of limitations in the state where she lives\n(hereinafter State).   \n3\nApplicant, who is 54 years old, works as a technical order librarian for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. Applicant retired from the United States Air Force in\nJanuary 1997 after 20 years of service. She began working as a contractor in April\n1997. She held a security clearance while on active duty, without incident. She has held\na security clearance as a contractor since 1997, without incident.4\nApplicant married her first husband in 1983 and they divorced in 1992. She has\ntwo adult children from her marriage, who are 29 and 26 years old. Her daughter and\nson live independently from her. She married her present husband in 2001.5\n\nId. at 14.\n6\nAE C; Tr. at 14-16, 29.\n7\nTr. 17.\n8\nAE B; AE C.\n9\n3\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began around 2000 with the pregnancy of her then\n15-year-old daughter. For many years thereafter, Applicant supported her daughter and\ngrandchildren, who are now 9, 5 and 4. Her daughter no longer lives with her and\nApplicant is not providing financial support for her daughter and grandchildren.\nApplicant\u2019s son is married and does not live with Applicant.6\nWhen the events of September 11, 2001 occurred, Applicant\u2019s husband worked\nfor a United States airline company. Because all airlines were grounded for a period of\ntime in September 2001, his company laid-off or reduced the pay of its employees.\nApplicant\u2019s husband continued to work at a salary one-third less than his pay before\nSeptember 11, 2001. Her husband retired from the airline in 2007. He does not receive\nretirement income from the airline company, but can fly, without charge, anywhere the\nairline flies. He now works 25 to 30 hours a week in maintenance work, earning $12 an\nhour. He is also retired from the United States Air Force and receives retirement\nincome.  \n7\nAt the time Applicant and her husband married, he had significant debt and\nfinancial problems. After September 11, 2001 and his significant loss of pay, he\ncontacted a debt counseling service. With the assistance of this service, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband resolved his earlier debt issues. They concentrated their efforts on resolving\nhis debt problems to the detriment of her finances. As a result, Applicant failed to pay all\nof her monthly expenses.8\nApplicant\u2019s monthly income from her job and military retirement totals $3,635.\nHer husband\u2019s monthly income from his military retirement and part-time job totals\n$2,238 for a total monthly household income of $5,918. They live in a trailer they own,\nand they rent the lot where their trailer is located. Although Applicant has not sought\ncredit counseling, she and her husband have developed a detailed monthly budget,\nusing his knowledge from his past debt-counseling experience. Their budget detailed\nthe allocation of their income each month for debt payment, including some debts listed\nin the SOR. Their budgeted monthly expenses total $4,624.Their budget does not\ninclude food costs and miscellaneous expenses. I estimate these expenses at $500 a\nmonth. Applicant has approximately $800 a month remaining after paying her bills listed\nin her budget. The record evidence does not contain information which would indicate\nthat this money equates to payroll deductions.9\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes more than $45,000 to creditors. The\ncreditor in SOR allegation 1.a obtained a judgment against Applicant in 2006. The\n\nAE D; AE H; Tr. 34-35.\n10\nAE A; AE I; Tr. 24-27.\n11\nGE 3; AE Q; Tr. 38-44.\n12\n4\ncreditor collected the judgment by garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages. The judgment has\nbeen paid in full. This debt is the same as the debt alleged in allegation 1.aa.10\nSOR allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e concern four tax liens filed against\nApplicant by the State. Applicant\u2019s son became emancipated in 2005, and thus,\nApplicant could no longer claim him as a dependent for tax purposes. Applicant and her\nhusband did not change their tax withholding information to reflect this change. As a\nresult, they owed additional taxes to the State. Prior to their marriage, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband also owed taxes to the State revenue service. Applicant and her husband\nbegan repaying the state tax debt in October 2008. By the hearing date, they had paid\n$2,600 on their state tax debt, which totaled more than $6,000. The two smaller tax\nliens were paid when the Internal Revenue Service forwarded their tax refund to the\nState. After the hearing, they paid the remainder of their state tax debt.11\nApplicant suffered from migraine headaches from 2003 until 2005. She sought\nmedical care at a hospital emergency room on many occasions. She provided the\nhospital with her insurance information. She had then, and still has, two health\ninsurance policies with two separate insurance companies. Her primary insurance\ncompany is through her job and her secondary insurance company is as a military\nretiree. Her insurance carriers paid the hospital bills. She believed that medical bills\nlisted in SOR allegations 1.f to 1.l, 1.q to 1.z, and 1.ff to 1.kk are bills from the\nemergency room physicians, who worked under a contract with the hospital. These bills\nshould have been paid by her insurance plans. She spoke with a representative from\nher secondary carrier, who advised that the bills had not been submitted for payment.\nShe also believed that the physicians\u2019 medical practice is no longer operating.\nApplicant\u2019s husband contacted the collection company. The collection company\nrequested payment and suggested Applicant then submit the medical bills for payment.\nApplicant\u2019s husband told the collection company to submit the bills for payment as is the\nnormal process. The collection company stopped its contact with them after this\nconversation. The medical bills listed in the SOR total $4,487. Several debts may be\nduplications of other listed debts, but the evidence is unclear on this issue. The medical\nbills listed in SOR allegations 1.q to 1.y remain on Applicant\u2019s credit report and total\n$2,600. Because the other medical debts are no longer on her credit report, Applicant\nbelieves that the debts have been paid by her insurance companies. She has not\nprovided documentation that these debts are paid.12\nApplicant developed a payment plan with the creditor listed in SOR allegation\n1.bb. She began paying $294 a month in June 2008. She has paid this amount monthly\nand currently owes less than $3,000 on this judgment. She expects to pay this debt by\nNovember 2010. Applicant also began a payment plan with the creditor in SOR\n\nAE E; AE J; AE M; AE N; Tr. 51-53.\n13\nSOR allegations 1.m and 1.dd are for the same car repossession debt. Allegation 1. dd reflects the current\n14\nbalance as $3,247. See AE Q (Credit Report, dated November 17, 2009). \nAE L; Tr. 45-46.\n15\nId.\n16\n5\nallegation 1.n. She pays $260 a month on this debt and currently owes less than $1,300\non this debt. She anticipates full payment of the debt by April or May 2010. The creditor\nin SOR allegation 1.ee forgave Applicant\u2019s debt. The creditor reported the debt\nforgiveness amount of $5,758 to the IRS and the state revenue service as income for\nApplicant. Just prior to the hearing, Applicant received a notice of proposed tax\nassessment from the State for the debt forgiveness. The State revised her income for\nthe tax year 2005 and requested a payment of $490 by November 15, 2009. Applicant\npaid the taxes due on the debt forgiveness on November 13, 2009.13\nTwo large debts remain unpaid (SOR allegations 1.m, which is the same as\n1.dd,  and 1.p). These debts total approximately $11,000. One debt occurred when\n14\nApplicant\u2019s son failed to pay his monthly car payment and the car was repossessed.\nAfter the creditor sold the car, Applicant and her son owe $3,247 on this debt. Although\nshe co-signed the car loan, Applicant believes this debt belongs to her son, who has not\nmade arrangements to pay the debt. The remaining credit card debt is hers. Applicant\u2019s\nfather-in-law died in March 2009. Her husband anticipates receiving an inheritance from\nhis father and indicates the money will be used to resolve these two accounts.  \n15\nSOR allegations 1.n and 1.o involve the same cell phone account, which\nbelonged to Applicant\u2019s daughter. Applicant believes she paid this account in full in\n2003, but she has not requested the creditor or the credit reporting agency to\ninvestigate her belief, nor has she provided proof of her payment.  \n16\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n6\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 (App.Bd. Sept. 26, 2006)\n17\n7\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was unable to\npay her obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries did\nnot arise under such unusual circumstances that these worries are unlikely to recur.\nRather, the circumstances causing her financial problems could recur. Her financial\nproblems are recurring and ongoing. This mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), disqualifying conditions may be mitigated when Athe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2000 and 2001 with\nher daughter\u2019s pregnancy and her husband\u2019s significant loss of income. To their credit,\nshe and her husband worked to resolve his debt problems after his income declined.\nThis decision negatively impacted her finances, which continue to be problematic. Since\n2008, Applicant and her husband have worked to gain control over their finances. This\nmitigating condition has some applicability in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). While Applicant has not sought credit\ncounseling, she and her husband are using the knowledge that he learned from his past\nexperience with debt counseling to gain control over their finances. They developed\nrepayment plans in 2008 for their state tax debt, one judgment, and one credit account,\nand have complied with their payment plans. In addition, one debt was paid through\ngarnishment and one debt has been resolved through loan forgiveness.  This mitigating\n17\ncondition applies to allegations 1.a-1.e, 1.aa-1.cc, and 1.ee.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) can apply where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nApplicant developed debt payment plans following tax liens, judgments, or threat of\ncourt action, not on her own initiative. While she has paid or is paying these debts, her\ndecision to pay the debts under these circumstances does not constitute good faith.\nThis mitigating condition is not applicable.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not raised in this case. Applicant has not filed formal\nchallenges with the credit reporting companies or the creditors for her unresolved debts.\n\n8\nWhile her husband has indicated that he will use his inheritance to resolve to the two\nlarge debts, he has not received his inheritance nor can he estimate at this time how\nmuch money he will receive. Future intent to pay debts is not sufficient evidence to\nsupport mitigation. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching my conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant\u2019s finances became unmanageable when her husband\u2019s income declined by\none-third. He sought financial counseling, which helped resolve his debts. They focused\ntheir financial resources on his debts to the detriment of her debts. In the last decade,\nApplicant\u2019s daughter received significant financial assistance from Applicant to help\nraise her three children. This additional financial cost associated with raising her\ngrandchildren diverted income away from debt repayment.\nApplicant\u2019s daughter and grandchildren do not live with her anymore, and\nApplicant no longer provides financial support to her daughter. In the last 18 months or\nmore, Applicant and her husband have successfully worked to gain control over their\nfinances and to repay her old debt. They have a budget and a plan for allocation of their\nmonthly income towards bill payment. They are improving their financial situation. The\n\n9\nSOR alleged more than $45,000 in unpaid debt. Applicant\u2019s credible evidence reflects\nthat she has resolved or is resolving over $29,000 of this debt or more than 60% of the\ndebts alleged in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s unpaid debts can be placed in three categories: car repossession\n($3,247 1.dd), commercial credit accounts ($8,454 1.n-1.p), and medical bills ($5,000\n1.f to 1.l, 1.q to 1.z, 1.ff-1.kk).The intent of Applicant\u2019s husband to use his inheritance to\nresolve the car repossession and commercial credit accounts is admirable. However,\nunder Appeal Board law, a promises of a future intent to pay is not evidence of payment\nand rehabilitation of debt. See ISCR No. 08-05379 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2009). Applicant\nbelieves she paid the two cell phone debts in 2003, but has not provided documents\nwhich reflect payment, nor has she challenged the validity of these two small debts with\nthe credit reporting companies.  At this time, these debts remain unresolved.\nApplicant\u2019s unpaid medical bills present a unique problem. At the time she\nincurred these bills, she presented the hospital with information about her insurance\ncoverage, primary and secondary. Her insurance companies paid the hospital bills for\nher treatments between 2003 and 2005. For reasons unknown to Applicant, the\nemergency room physicians\u2019 office failed to submit its bills for payment. While Applicant\nmay be absolutely correct that the bills would be paid by her insurance carriers, she had\nan obligation when she became aware that the bills were not being paid to contact the\nemergency room physicians\u2019 office and determine why. The record contains no\nevidence that Applicant made this contact. At this point, the credit collection company is\nrefusing to submit the bills to Applicant\u2019s insurance carriers for payment. One likely\nreason for this refusal is that the credit collection company lacks information, such as\ndates of service, services rendered, or insurance codes, which would result in payment\nfrom the insurance carriers. I am not sure Applicant has information on dates of services\nand the types of services rendered. If she doesn\u2019t, she may not be able to pursue these\nclaims with her insurance carriers. Ultimately, Applicant is responsible for any medical\nbills not covered by insurance. Applicant argues that her medical bills have been paid by\nher insurance carriers, as shown by the deletion of many of her medical bills from her\ncredit report. The SOR lists medical bills totaling approximately $5,000. From a careful\nreview of the credit reports of record, there is a clear likelihood that some of the medical\ndebts listed in the SOR are duplicates because the debts have been sold from one\ncredit collection company to another without a correction of her credit report. The most\nrecent credit report shows that Applicant\u2019s unpaid medical bills total $2,612 and reflect\nthe deletion of many medical debts from the report. The reason for the deletion of these\ndebts is not known. Applicant has not provided information from the credit reporting\ncompany for this change in her credit report. Even assuming that many of the debts\nhave been removed as duplicates, Applicant still owes $2,612 in medical bills.\nApplicant argues that the statute of limitations applies to her debts. Under state\nlaw, a creditor must take court action within a specified period of time to collect the\ndebts owed to it. If the creditor does not pursue its rights within this specified period of\ntime, any legal action to collect the debt is barred from collection under state law. The\nAppeal Board has held that elimination of debts by the statute of limitations is not\n\n10\nevidence of a good-faith resolution of debt. The Appeal Board has held that for\npurposes of security clearance eligibility, old, time-barred debts are current and\nongoing. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 (App. Bd., Aug. 29, 2008).  \nApplicant has made good progress on her debt resolution. She still has a fair\namount of debt to resolve. Thus, I cannot favorably conclude that she should have a\nsecurity clearance. Under the Directive, a sponsored Applicant can apply for her\nsecurity clearance one year from the date of this decision. If she can show that she has\npaid or established payment plan for her remaining debts, she would be a good\ncandidate for being granted a security clearance, assuming no other issues of a security\nconcern arise. \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f-1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n-1.z\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa-1.cc:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.dd:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ee:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ff-1.kk:\nAgainst Applicant:\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guidelines \nB, Foreign Influence, and C, Foreign Preference. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nOn May 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 16, 2009. The government \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 25, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 1, 2009. I convened \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe hearing as scheduled on November 5, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 4. Applicant did not object and they were admitted into evidence. The \ngovernment also offered for administrative notice Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through X. I \ngranted the request and the documents were considered. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and he offered Exhibits (AE) A through D. They were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 12, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. He was born in Syria and came to the U.S. in 1979 to \nattend college. He has lived in the U.S. since that time. He became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 1991. He earned a bachelors degree in 1985 and a master\u2019s degree in 1989. \nSince November 1989, he has been employed as an engineer for different American \ncompanies. In June 2007, he accepted a position with his current employer, a \ngovernment contractor.1  \n \n \nApplicant has been married three times. He married his first wife in 1985. She \nwas a U.S. citizen by birth. They divorced in 1988. He met his second wife when he was \nin Syria. She was a Syrian citizen and resident. She never moved to the U.S. They \nmarried in 1997, and the marriage was annulled in 1998. He met his third wife when he \nwas in Syria. They were engaged for a year and married in the U.S. in 2006. She is a \ncitizen of Syria and a resident of the U.S. They have one child born in the U.S. and \nanother is due to be born in December 2009.2 \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant applied for and was issued a Syrian passport, even though he \nwas a naturalized U.S. citizen. The passport will not expire until April 19, 2011. He was \nadvised by Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) on August 21, 2008, \nthat if he voluntarily destroyed his Syrian passport in the presence of his Facilities \nSecurity Officer (FSO) that DISCO may grant his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance. He was told the procedure to follow if he intended to destroy the passport.3 \nOn the notification letter from DISCO, a written notation was made explaining that \nApplicant wanted an opportunity to explain to DOHA why he would like to keep his \npassport.4 On May 29, 2009, he received the SOR, which again advised him that \nretaining his Syrian passport was a security concern. As of the date of his hearing, \nApplicant retained his Syrian passport. He stated he is willing to surrender his Syrian \n \n1 Tr. 23-26. \n \n2 Tr. 32-34, 40-45. \n \n3 Tr. 19; AE C. \n \n4 AE C. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \npassport for destruction. He stated he had not yet provided the passport for destruction \nbecause he is waiting to be instructed to do so.5 In a document provided at his hearing \nApplicant stated \u201cI am willing to surrender my Syrian passport to my employer\u2019s security \nauthority for [safe keeping] or destruction.\u201d In his answer to the SOR he stated that \u201cif \nrequested, the Syrian passport can be submitted to your office or given to your \ndesignated security officer for destruction.\u201d6 Despite repeated advice about the \nramification of retention of his Syrian passport, Applicant continues to retain his Syrian \npassport. I did not find Applicant\u2019s offer to submit his passport for destruction to be \nmade sincerely or in good faith.  \n \n \nApplicant explained he obtained a Syrian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen \nso when he traveled to Syrian he would not be subjected to officials at the airport \nattempting to extort money from him because he has an American passport. He stated if \nhe shows a Syrian passport he is less likely to be solicited for money. He stated he has \nnever used his Syrian passport for entering or exiting any country. He always uses his \nAmerican passport. However, if he felt the need to, while in Syria, he would show it. \nApplicant also explained that he was detained at the airport because he believed the \nofficials were attempting to extort money from him. He said he did not show his Syrian \npassport because it did not feel right.7  \n \n \nApplicant stated he has no rights, privileges, or obligations to any foreign country \nand receives no benefits from a foreign country. He stated that in 2001, he paid the \ncountry of Syria $10,000 so he would be exempt from military service in Syria. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he quoted a U.S. Department of State, Country Specific Information \ndocument pertaining to Syria. It stated: \u201cthe fee for exemption from military service \nranges from $5,000 to $15,000, depending upon the circumstances, for Syrian-\nAmerican and Palestinian-American men who live abroad.\u201d8 \n \n \nApplicant does not own any property in the U.S. He has approximately $47,000 \nto $50,000 in assets. He has approximately $100,000 in his 401(k). In 1985, he \npurchased an unfurnished apartment as investment property in Syria. At the time it cost \nabout $10,000. He notes it is now worth between $15,000 and $20,000. He has \nconsidered selling the property, but would have difficulty transferring money from Syria \nto the U.S. He does not receive any income from the property or pay taxes on it. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he stated \u201cI am willing to sell the property if necessary.\u201d9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of Syria and the U.S. She resides in Syria. \nApplicant sponsored her for U.S. citizenship in 1999.

She returned to Syria and has lived there since then. She visited Applicant in the \nU.S. in 2006. Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Syria. He owns a men\u2019s \nclothing store and is self-employed. Applicant talks to his parents weekly.10  \n \n \nApplicant has a brother who lives in the U.S. His brother became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen in 1999. His brother is a loan officer. He is divorced, and his children live \nwith their mother in the same metropolitan area.11 \n \n \nApplicant has a sister who is a citizen of Syria and is a permanent resident of the \nU.S. She is a homemaker and her husband is a doctor. They live in Saudi Arabia where \nher husband is the director of a government urgent care hospital. He is from Syria and \nis a naturalized citizen of U.S. They have lived in Saudi Arabia for a year and a half. \nThey have one child who was born in Syria.12  \n \n \nApplicant has another sister who is a dual citizen of Syria and the United \nKingdom. She is a homemaker who lives in Syria. She is married to an eye doctor. They \nhave two children, ages 18 and 24, who attend school in the Czech Republic. The \nchildren are dual citizens of Syria and the United Kingdom. Applicant speaks with his \nsister weekly.13 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Syria. His father-in-law \nretired from the Damascus police department in 1993. Applicant did not know if his \nfather-in-law receives a pension and does not know where he gets money to live. His \nmother-in-law is a homemaker. She has visited Applicant and his wife in the U.S. one \ntime after their child was born in February 2008. His wife has almost daily contact by \ntelephone with her parents. Applicant has contact with them two or three times a year.14  \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s wife has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Syria. One is a \nhomemaker and her husband, also a citizen and resident of Syria manages a factory \nthat makes laundry detergent. They have no children. Her other sister is single and lives \nwith her parents.15  \n \n \nApplicant visited Syria seven times from April 1997 to September 2008. He \nestimated he visited once in 1998, once in 1999, once in 2004, three times in 2005, and \nonce in 2006. Since 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife has visited Syria without him two to three \ntimes for about 30 days each visit. In May 2009 Applicant and his wife visited Syria and \n \n10 Tr. 22, 76-81. \n \n11 Tr. 34, 81-83. \n \n12 Tr. 83-90. \n \n13 Tr. 90-92. \n \n14 Tr. 22, 92-94, 100. \n \n15 Tr. 96-98. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nsaw both sets of parents and other family members, including his sister and brother-in-\nlaw and his wife\u2019s two sisters, who are Syrian citizens. Applicant\u2019s wife and his son \nvisited for about six weeks. Applicant stated that his son is considered a Syrian citizen \nby the Syrian government because his mother and father were born in Syria. Applicant \nand his son traveled on their U.S. passports. His wife used her Syrian passport.16  \n \n \nApplicant was asked at his hearing if he had considered renouncing his Syrian \ncitizenship. He responded \u201cI have not considered it, because I had no reason, and I \nknow it\u2019s not against the law in the United States to be a dual citizen. In his answer to \ngovernment interrogatories that included the summary of his interview and which \nApplicant authenticated, he stated he did not know if he would renounce his Syrian \ncitizenship, but would consider it. When asked again at his hearing if he had considered \nit, he stated, \u201cif required, yes, I would renounce it.\u201d17 \n \nSyria18 \n \n \nSyria is ruled by an authoritarian regime and is included on the U.S. State \nDepartment\u2019s List of State Sponsors of Terrorism. There are several known terrorist \ngroups in Syria. The government of Syria continues to provide political and material \nsupport to Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist groups. Several terrorist groups maintain \ntheir offices and external leadership in Syria. In addition, the government of Syria \npermits Iran to transfer weapons and supplies through their country to assist terrorists in \nLebanon. Syria is one of the main transit points for foreign fighters entering Iraq. A \ntravel warning for Syria warns about terrorism due to the September 2006 attack on the \nU.S. embassy in Damascus. There have been other attacks on the U.S. Ambassador\u2019s \nresidence and the U.S. embassy in 1998 and 2000. \n \n \nThe U.S. instituted economic sanctions against Syria due to their active and \npassive support of terrorism in the Middle East. No commercial aircraft owned or \noperated by the Syrian government may take off or land in the U.S. There are human \nrights abuses in Syria that include systematic repression of citizens\u2019 ability to change \ngovernment, arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life, torture and physical abuse of \nprisoners and detainees, arbitrary arrests and detention, restrictions on freedom of \nspeech, press, assembly, and association, government corruption, and violence and \ndiscrimination against women. Torture is frequently used, including against foreign \ncitizens. Security personnel have placed foreign visitors under surveillance, have \nmonitored telephones, and have searched hotel rooms and possessions of foreign \ncitizens.  \n \n \n16 Tr. 55-63, 66-69. \n \n17 Tr. 74-75. \n \n18 HE I-X. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nDual citizens and U.S. citizens of Syrian origin may be subject to compulsory \nmilitary service in Syrian unless they receive a temporary or permanent exemption from \nsuch service prior to their entry into Syria.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the security concern regarding foreign preference:  \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport .  .  .   (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or \nbusiness interests in another country. \nApplicant holds a valid Syrian passport. He paid a fee to exempt himself from \nserving in the Syrian military and he owns property in Syria. Due to the economic \nsanctions imposed on Syria by the U.S., he can not transfer money from Syria to the \nU.S. I find disqualifying condition (a) (1) and (5) applies. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11. Specifically I have \nconsidered the following:  \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country;  \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;  \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; and  \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not based solely on his birth in a foreign country. \nHe was born in Syria and retained his Syrian citizenship after he became a U.S. citizen \nby applying for and retaining a Syrian passport. I find (a) does not apply. Applicant has \nnot formally renounced his Syrian citizenship. He has expressed a willingness to do so, \nbut only if requested. He has been advised about the security ramifications of retaining \nhis passport and citizenship. I did not find that Applicant\u2019s offer to relinquish or destroy \nhis Syrian passport, or his offer to renounce his Syrian citizenship to be sincere and in \ngood faith. Despite repeated advice on how to relinquish his Syrian passport he has not \ntaken any action. I find (b) does not apply. Applicant continues to hold property in Syria \nand paid the Syrian government so he would be exempt from military service, an \nobligation of male Syrian citizens. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(c) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Syria and his son is \nconsidered a Syrian citizen because he was born to a Syrian. She lives with Applicant in \nthe U.S. and is a permanent U.S. resident. Applicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the \nU.S. and Syria and resides in Syria. His father is a citizen and resident of Syria. His \nsister and her husband are citizens of Syria residing in Saudi Arabia and his father-in-\nlaw is a citizen and resident of Syria. Applicant owns property in Syria valued at \napproximately $15,000 to $20,000. Applicant traveled multiple times to Syria from 1998 \nto 2009. The latest trip was in May 2009. His wife travels to Syria and visits for \napproximately four to six weeks. Applicant and his wife maintain close contact with \nfamily members in Syria. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests;   \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nApplicant and his wife travel regularly to Syria to visit their family. They are both \nin close contact with their parents and relatives in Syria. His wife is in almost daily \ncontact with her family there. Applicant has not met his burden of establishing that it is \nunlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfamily living in Syria and the interests of the U.S. His contacts with family in Syria could \npotentially force him to choose between the two.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the foreign government or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. No evidence was presented \nthat Syria conducts intelligence operations against the U.S. However, there is evidence \nregarding Syria\u2019s human rights record and active support and sponsorship of terrorist \ngroups operating in Syria and other countries. This places the burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his contacts in Syria do not pose a security risk, and he is \nnot in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and his family \nmembers. With its negative human rights record, its authoritarian government, and its \nwillingness to assist terrorist organizations, it is conceivable that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers could be vulnerable to coercion. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen since 1999 and retains his dual citizenship with \nSyria. He has some family in the U.S., but most of his ties through his family and his \nwife\u2019s are in Syria. They travel there to spend time with their family, usually four to six \nweeks at a time. His wife is a Syrian citizen, as is his father and other relatives who also \nreside in Syria. His father-in-law is a retired police officer, who likely receives some type \nof pension from the Syrian government. Considering Syria\u2019s human rights record and \nwell known association and support of terrorist groups I find there is a potential conflict \nof interest, and under the circumstances mitigating condition (b) does not apply.  \n \nSecurity concerns are reduced where contact and correspondence with foreign \ncitizens are casual and infrequent because the risk of foreign exploitation or pressure is \nless. Applicant and his wife regularly visit their families in Syria. They also maintain \nregular telephone contact with their families. These contacts are not casual and \ninfrequent. I find mitigating condition (c) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant owns real property in Syria that is valued between $15,000 and \n$20,000. Based on Applicant\u2019s total assets it is unlikely that the value of this property \ncould be used to effectively influence, manipulate, or coerce him. Because Applicant \nhas not divested himself of the property, it remains a concern because it is another \nstrong tie that Applicant maintains with Syria. I find mitigating condition (f) applies to \nApplicant\u2019s property interests. However, I will consider this factor when evaluating the \nwhole person.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n11 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has lived in the U.S. since \n1979 and been a U.S. citizen since 1991. He retains his dual citizenship with Syrian and \nmaintains an active Syrian passport. Despite being advised of the ramifications to his \nsecurity clearance application, he continues to retain his Syrian passport. I did not find \nhis testimony sincere or in good faith that he was willing to destroy the passport and \nrenounce his Syrian citizenship. Applicant\u2019s wife is a Syrian citizen. Applicant and his \nwife maintain close contact with their relatives in Syria. His wife speaks to her family \nalmost daily and Applicant speaks with his family weekly. They travel to Syria to visit \nthem and sometimes stay for four to six weeks. After becoming a U.S. citizen Applicant \npaid the Syrian government $10,000 to exempt him from compulsory military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines for \nForeign Influence and Foreign Preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F \nand E, Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 13, 2009. It was unclear from his \nresponse whether he wanted a hearing before an administrative judge or the case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. At his hearing, Applicant verified that \nJanuary 8, 2010\n\n2 \nhe wanted a hearing. The case was assigned to me on September 1, 2009. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on September 30, 2009, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on November 3, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, \nwhich were received without objection. A stipulation to the admissibility of GE 1 through \n7 was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received without objection. One \nwitness testified. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit \nadditional information. Applicant submitted AE D, which was admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memo is marked HE II. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on November 12, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since June 2008. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and an associate\u2019s \ndegree. He has been married for more than 25 years and has a 14-year-old child.1 \n \n \nThe SOR lists four delinquent debts totaling about $36,749, and a mortgage that \nwas in foreclosure with a balance of $275,095. Applicant admitted that he owed all the \ndelinquent debts but stated that he had filed bankruptcy.2  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1972. He realized \nthat further education in a scientific field would provide him with more opportunities, and \nhe went back to school and earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1978. He was steadily \nemployed as a computer programmer for many years and had no financial issues. He \naccepted a job in 1999, and he and his family moved to another state. He was laid-off \nfrom that job in June 2001, which started an extended period of unemployment and \nunderemployment. He remained unemployed until he obtained a job in January 2002. \nAdditional periods of unemployment included from November 2006 to February 2007, \nSeptember to December 2007, and March to June 2008. Applicant took jobs at below \nthe level of his education and experience, including delivering pizza. His current job is in \ndata entry, which carries a much lesser salary than his previous positions as a computer \nprogrammer.3  \n \n \nApplicant was unable to maintain payments on his debts during his periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, and a number of debts became delinquent. He \nwould contact the creditors and attempt to catch-up while he was working. He would \nthen fall behind again when he became unemployed. He was sued by one creditor who \nobtained a judgment of about $13,000 in April 2007. Applicant eventually lost his house \nto foreclosure. His wife lost her job in September 2009.4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 33-35; GE 1. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-29, 33-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr. at 27-28, 37-46, 70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4. \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant believed his only recourse was to file bankruptcy. He was unable to \npay a bankruptcy attorney for a period. He found a legal document preparation \ncompany that does not provide legal representation but provides assistance in the \npreparation of court documents. He paid the company $600 for their services and filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2009. Under Schedule F \u2013 Creditors Holding Unsecured \nNonpriority Claims he listed 14 creditors and debts totaling $71,745. There were no \nsecured or priority debts listed under the relevant schedules. The court has not yet \napproved the bankruptcy. Applicant received counseling pursuant to his bankruptcy. \nApplicant and his wife have adjusted to him making a smaller salary. They have a \nsimple lifestyle and will be able to pay their current debts once the bankruptcy court \ndischarges their debts.5  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) on June 4, \n2008. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 19 and 20, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have \nyou, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been \ndeclared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgement rendered against \nyou for a debt?\u201d and \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial \nobligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment.)\u201d Applicant fully discussed his finances and delinquent debts when he was \ninterviewed for his background investigation in August 2008. He responded truthfully to \nDOHA interrogatories in December 2008 and March 2009. He was open and candid \nabout his finances at his hearing. Applicant denied intending to mislead the government \nabout his finances. He credibly testified that he did not know the one debt was reduced \nto a judgment. Because he was continuously attempting to catch-up with his delinquent \ndebts when he was working, it was unclear in his mind if he had ever been 180 days \ndelinquent on his debts.6 After considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant did not \nintentionally falsify his SF 85P.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous character letters. He is praised by all for his \ncomplete honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness.7 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 29-31, 50-51, 57; GE 3; AE C, D.  \n \n6 Tr. at 52-54, 58-66; GE 1-4.  \n7 AE A. \n \n\n4 \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:   \n   \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n5 \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).  \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20(a) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but the court has not yet granted the \ndischarge of his debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable at this time.  \n \n \nApplicant had stable employment as a computer programmer and was financially \nsound for many years. In 1999, he accepted a new job, and his family relocated to \nanother state. His finances remained in order until he was laid-off from that job in 2001. \nThat started an extensive period of unemployment and underemployment from which he \nhas still not completely recovered. Those are conditions that were largely beyond his \ncontrol. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant fell behind on his debts when he was \nunemployed and then attempted to catch-up when he obtained a job. The debts \n\n6 \nbecame too much to handle and he took his only recourse, which was bankruptcy. He \nreceived financial counseling pursuant to his bankruptcy. His debts have not yet been \ndischarged, but the bankruptcy is sufficiently advanced that there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved. Applicant receives partial consideration under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(b) and 20(c). His actions do not qualify as a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.8 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n[sensitive] information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the [public trust position] process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the [public trust position] process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant submitted inaccurate information on his SF 85P, but as discussed \nabove, it was not an intentional falsification. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n7 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He had a successful career as a computer programmer for \nmany years and he was financially stable. An extended period of unemployment and \nunderemployment devastated his finances. He fell behind on his payments and then \nattempted to catch-up when he obtained a job. He became overwhelmed and took his \nonly recourse, which was bankruptcy. His debts have not yet been discharged, but I am \nconvinced that Applicant is on the right track. He has adjusted his lifestyle to a lower \nincome. Additional financial problems are unlikely. As discussed above, relying on \nbankruptcy does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. However, Applicant exhausted all other resources before \nresorting to this legal avenue. He attempted to pay his debts and accepted a menial job \nbefore he finally accepted bankruptcy as a means to start over. If the debts are \ndischarged, the risk of him having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds and his \npotential vulnerability to financial inducements are greatly reduced or eliminated. \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not perfect. But the issue is not whether Applicant has unpaid \ndebts; the issue is whether his debts make him an unacceptable risk. I find they do not. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: David E. Mosley, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office \n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD \nC3I) entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness \ndeterminations for contractor personnel employed in Information Systems Positions as \ndefined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated \nJanuary of 1987. \n \n \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaires for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on \nApril 4, 2008. On May 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) which detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, \nsuitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a Sensitive Systems Position (ADP-\nI/II/III).  The trustworthiness concerns for Applicant arose under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n1 \n \nDecember 17, 2009\n\n2 \n \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nJan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 12, 2009.  He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 12, 2009. He did not request a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA converted the case to a hearing format on or before June 12, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 12, 2009, and I received the \ncase assignment on June 15, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 29, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 15, 2009. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were received without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, called one additional witness, and submitted Exhibit A, \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 27, 2009. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 12, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 1.a, and 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a public trust position.   \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, married, and has a 16-year-old son from a prior \nrelationship.  He works for a defense contractor as a database administrator.  He has \nbeen so employed since November 2004. After his prison release in 2002, Applicant \nworked for his brother for six months, then as a carpenter for six months, and for one \nyear at a nationally-known home improvement center. Applicant owns his home and is \nan active member in his church, where he also teaches.  (Tr. 35, 47, 57, 78, 84; Exhibit \n1) \n \nApplicant was arrested on or about September 24, 1990, for possession of drugs, \npossession of stolen property, and possession of drugs with intent to sell them.  The \nApplicant\u2019s friend was arrested for the offenses originally, but the drugs were Applicant\u2019s \nbecause the friend was transporting them for the Applicant\u2019s roommates to use. \nApplicant was a passenger in his friend\u2019s car. Applicant denied using these drugs. \nApplicant turned himself into the police and took the blame for the drugs, exonerating \nhis friend. He pled guilty to the offenses, and received a sentence of fines, community \nservice, and probation.  Applicant successfully completed his probation. (Tr. 36; Exhibits \n2, 3) \n \nIn 1989, Applicant used his pocket knife to stab a man who was in a fight with \none of Applicant\u2019s friends.  The Applicant and his friend had gone to the victim\u2019s house \nto buy some bootlegged liquor.  Applicant was intoxicated at the time.  When he saw his \nfriend involved in the fight, he assumed the bootlegger attacked his friend.  In fact, his \n\n3 \n \nfriend was attempting to rob the bootlegger. Applicant stabbed the victim bootlegger \nseveral times with the knife. On the news several days later Applicant learned the victim \ndied.  \n \nIn April 1995 Applicant was arrested and charged with murder and burglary (for \nstealing beer as he fled from the victim\u2019s home). Applicant remained in jail after his \narrest until the trial on the charges. In June 1996, the charges were reduced to \nvoluntary manslaughter and burglary as part of a plea agreement. The victim\u2019s mother \nand brother, now deceased, requested at the time that Applicant be given a chance to \nrejoin society as a productive member of it after serving any prison time. The state court \nsentenced Applicant to 20 years in jail on the manslaughter charge, and 10 years on the \nburglary charge, to be served simultaneously. Applicant served 7.5 years in jail.  He \napplied for early release, and was granted it by the state court by the modification and \nearly release in 2002.  Applicant was placed on probation for at least five years.  After \nsuccessfully completing the five years, his probation officer suggested he apply to have \nthe probation removed. He did so, and the state court again granted his request, \nterminating the probation in 2007. (Tr. 37-45, 61-64, 83; Exhibits 2, 3, A) \n \nWhile in prison, Applicant obtained an associate\u2019s degree, and then a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He majored in history, with computer science as a minor. He was also \nemployed in prison as the coordinator for the prison college education program. He \nincreased participation from 100 to 200 inmates while in that position. He graduated \nsumma cum laude with a 3.92 grade point average.  He also attended any rehabilitation \ncourse the prison offered, such as substance abuse and anger management. He was \napproved to live in honor housing because he had no demerits or disciplinary problems \nwhile in prison. After his release from prison, he attended courses to become a certified \nnetwork administrator. He is working on a master\u2019s degree in computer science with a \nprojected graduation date in 2010. In addition to his employment with the defense \ncontractor, he teaches as an adjunct professor of systems engineering at a local \nbusiness college. He paid for his college education (that portion of which the state did \nnot pay) while he was in prison. (Tr. 37-41, 84, 85; Exhibit 1) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified he hired Applicant away from another unit \nof the company because of his technical skills and reputation among his staff. This \nmove was a promotion for Applicant. The supervisor regards Applicant as professional, \na good worker, reliable, and dependable. Applicant has a good temperament and is \nconstantly learning new information about computers to improve his work skills. \nAccording to the supervisor, he is pleased with Applicant\u2019s work and is glad he hired \nhim. He considers Applicant trustworthy. Applicant\u2019s supervisor learned of Applicant\u2019s \nprison term and conviction after Applicant was initially denied a favorable \ntrustworthiness determination. Knowing those facts, he came and testified on his behalf \nat the hearing. (Tr. 21-31) \n \nApplicant completed his SF-85P on April 4, 2008, after spending several days \nwriting the answers to the questions. In response to Question 20, \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense?,\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d He knew his arrest and conviction for manslaughter and burglary \n\n4 \n \noccurred more than seven years earlier, in 1995, so he assumed he answered the \nquestion properly and did not deliberately falsify the answer. He answered Question 11 \nwith his employment activities, and listed his time in the state jail from November 1996 \nto November 2002 in that area of the SF-85P, without specifically identifying it as a state \njail. (Tr. 50-53, 66, 75; Exhibit 1) \n \nThe county prosecuting attorney who handled Applicant\u2019s case in 1995 wrote a \nletter in favor of Applicant. He stated in the letter that the intention of the victim\u2019s mother \nand brother was to see Applicant rehabilitated rather than spend his life in jail.  He \nexplained that the friend involved with Applicant in the 1989 death, and who was tried in \n1996 when Applicant was convicted on his plea, has continued to be involved in crime \nand currently is in prison. This same prosecuting attorney was the attorney at \nApplicant\u2019s 2002 sentence modification hearing, and did not oppose that modification. \n(Tr. 42, 43; Exhibit A) \n \nApplicant is a credible and compelling witness. The letter from the prosecuting \nattorney was very impressive and persuasive because he stated that he rarely writes a \nrecommendation letter, and he willingly provided important background information on \nthe 1996 prosecution. (Exhibit A) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n5 \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. Applicant has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \n Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions may apply to Applicant: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n \nApplicant killed a man in 1989.  In 1990, he admitted he possessed illegal drugs \nand was sentenced to probation.  In 1995 he was arrested for the 1989 killing, and was \nin jail from then until November 2002.  He was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and \n\n6 \n \nburglary for the 1989 offenses. AG \u00b6 31 (a) and (c) apply because of the serious 1989 \ncrime, and the lesser 1990 crime.  Also, Applicant admitted both crimes as part of the \ncourt procedures involving both offenses. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns under this \nguideline.  Two conditions may apply to Applicant: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment \nrecord, or constructive community involvement. \n \nApplicant\u2019s offenses occurred 19 and 20 years ago.  Since then, there have been \nno further violations of law.  In 1989 Applicant was intoxicated and associated with a \nperson who has continued to be in trouble with the law.  Applicant attacked the victim \nwhen he thought the victim was attacking Applicant\u2019s companion.  These are unique \nfacts and circumstances, which are unlikely to recur. The 1990 offense was unique \nbecause Applicant was merely transporting drugs for friends. He went to the police \nstation to admit his possession of the drugs, so the driver, who was arrested, could be \nfreed.  In both situations, Applicant admitted his guilt, paid his fines, and served his \nsentences. AG \u00b6 32 (a) applies. \n \nApplicant introduced a large amount of rehabilitation information. During his \nprison incarceration, he obtained two college degrees, lived in honor housing, took \nrehabilitation courses, and worked as the college course coordinator to help other \ninmates obtain a college degree. After his release from prison in 2002, Applicant \nsuccessfully completed five years of probation.  At his probation officer\u2019s suggestion, he \napplied for and was granted early probation termination. He immediately obtained \nemployment with his brother and then two other employers until getting a job with his \ncurrent employer. He continues his educational pursuits, and teaches as an adjunct \nprofessor at a local business college. He is now married, and has custody of his 16-\nyear-old son. Applicant is a regular church member and teaches religion classes there. \nHe has not been involved in any violations of law since 1990 when he committed the \nlast one. Applicant meets the requirements of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32 (d).   \n  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n7 \n \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any \nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security forms \nor releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nand, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions \nof \ninvestigators, \nsecurity \nofficials, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying.  One mitigating condition applies to Applicant: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities. \n \nApplicant did not disclose his 1995 arrest for murder and burglary on his SF-85P \ncompleted in April 2008. Nor did he disclose his conviction in 1996 for voluntary \nmanslaughter and burglary on his SF-85P. However, Applicant answered Question 20 \nin accordance with the time frame written on the form. His offenses occurred prior to the \nseven year cut-off date, which would have been April 2001. The form could have asked \nfor more information, but did not do so. Therefore, there was no deliberate falsification. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  None \nof them apply to the facts in this case because there was no deliberate falsification. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n8 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant committed an offense in \n1989 causing the death of a man. He carried illegal drugs for his friends in 1990.  He \nadmitted both offenses. He was convicted in 1996 of the voluntary manslaughter and \nburglary charges arising from the 1989 offense. Since 1996, he successfully \nrehabilitated himself by obtaining a college degree, gainful employment, a teaching \nposition, a family, and participating in his church. His actions were serious, and he was \n20 years old when the first one occurred. He has not repeated his criminal actions after \n1990, 19 years ago.  There are obviously permanent behavioral changes. There is no \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. There is no likelihood or \nrecurrence or continuation of his past conduct as shown by his present conduct.  I was \nvery impressed by Applicant\u2019s testimony. The prosecuting attorney\u2019s letter on behalf of \nApplicant was very influential and persuasive in my deliberations. His supervisor\u2019s \ntestimony gave important perspective to Applicant\u2019s current employment and his \npromotion with his company. Applicant clearly is not a trustworthiness risk. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his criminal and \npersonal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept for \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a public trust position is denied.\nOn September 10, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust\nPositions (SF-85P) to request eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position  involving access to\n1\nsensitive information as part of her employment with a defense contractor. After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant two sets of\ninterrogatories  regarding potentially adverse information in her background. Based on\n2\nthe results of the background investigation and her responses to the interrogatories,\nOctober 26, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n3\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n4\nDecember 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, these guidelines take precedence over the guidelines contained in Enclosure\n2 to the Directive.\n Identified in the transcript at page 26.\n5\n2\nDOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n3\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On March 27,\n2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nraise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n4\nGuidelines E (personal conduct), F (financial considerations), and J (criminal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on June 18, 2009. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued on July 6,\n2009, I convened a hearing on July 30, 2009, at which the parties appeared as\nscheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5). Applicant testified in her\nown behalf, and she proffered five documents admitted collectively as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit (Ax.) A.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 7, 2009. I left the record\n5\nopen after the hearing to allow Applicant time to submit additional relevant information.\nThe record closed on August 17, 2009, when I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing\nsubmission via Department Counsel. It has been admitted without objection as Ax. B.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the government alleged Applicant owed approximately\n$24,695 for six delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.f) referred for collection between\nFebruary 2003 and December 2008. It was also alleged that, in March 2002, she was\ncharged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, was placed in a 12-month pre-trial\ndiversion program, and ordered to pay restitution (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In response, Applicant\nadmitted the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g. She also admitted SOR \u00b6 1.f, but\nprovided information with her answer showing she had paid that debt in February 2009.\nApplicant admitted she was aware of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.e,\nbut denied she is responsible for those debts. (Tr. 12 - 14)\nUnder Guideline J, the government cross-alleged as criminal conduct, Applicant\u2019s\n2002 arrest for conspiracy to commit bank fraud (SOR \u00b62.a). Applicant admitted to this\nallegation as well. She further stated that she complied \u201cwith all laws and regulations\ngiven which lead [sic] to early termination\u201d of her pre-trial diversion. \nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged that, by answering \u201cno\u201d to SF-85P\nquestion 12 (Employment Record), she deliberately omitted the fact that she was fired\nfrom a job in 2003 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). The government also alleged that, by answering \u201cno\u201d to\nSF-85P question 22 (Debts more than 180 days past due), she deliberately omitted the\n\n The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f was not delinquent at the time she completed the SF-85P.\n6\n3\nfact that she was delinquent on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.e (SOR \u00b6 3.b).6\nApplicant denied both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b. As to SOR \u00b6 3.a, she averred that all of the\njobs she held in 2003 were either temporary or ended when the employer downsized.\nAs to SOR \u00b6 3.b, she claimed her omission of her debts was an oversight. In addition to\nthe facts admitted through her response to the SOR, I make the following findings of\nfact based on my review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old single mother of two (ages 10 and 14), who works as a\nBeneficiary Service Representative for a large healthcare and medical insurance\ncompany contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for\nTRICARE, the Department of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military\npersonnel and their families. She has held her current position since September 2007.\nShe was unemployed between April 2007 and September 2007, after having worked in\na similar capacity for a different medical benefits firm for two years. Since November\n2003, her only other period of unemployment was in December 2004 and January 2005.\n(Gx. 1) \nApplicant is studying for her Associate\u2019s degree in Health Administration, which\nshe expects to obtain in May 2010. Her work performance with her current employer\nhas been exemplary. As recently as June 2009, she received a Letter of Appreciation\nfrom the commanding officer of the facility where she works. A co-worker lauds\nApplicant for her reliability, dedication, honesty, and integrity. (Gx. 1; Ax. A; Tr. 37 - 38)\nApplicant claimed that the debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e are not her\nresponsibility, as they were the result of fraud. She explained that she was twice the\nvictim of identity theft, first through a theft of her purse and credit cards while she was\nriding public transportation, then through a burglary of her father\u2019s house while Applicant\nwas living there. Applicant claimed she had police reports and other records to\ncorroborate this claim, but has not produced that information despite being given extra\ntime after the hearing. (Answer to SOR; Ax. B; Tr. 39 - 45, 61 - 64) She claimed the\ndebts were due to be removed from her credit history. These debts appeared on the first\ncredit report obtained in Applicant\u2019s background investigation (Gx. 5) and in a\nDecember 2008 credit report Applicant provided in response to DOHA interrogatories\n(Gx. 3). However, they do not appear in an October 2008 credit report obtained by\nDOHA adjudicators (Gx. 4). That report also reflects fraud alerts reported in September\nand November 2007.\nApplicant owes approximately $8,352 for the balance due on a loan for a used\ncar she bought in February 2002 (SOR 1.b). She was able to pay this note for about 18\nmonths, but defaulted on the loan when she was terminated from her job in 2003 after\nher arrest for conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Also contributing to her inability to pay\nher car note was the death of her father around the same time, which left her with\nfuneral expenses and the obligation to make his mortgage payments. Applicant still has\npossession of the car, which is no longer operable, but she cannot get clear title until\nshe resolves the remainder of the car note. (Gx. 2 - 5; Tr. 46 - 48)\n\n4\nApplicant also owes about $5,869 for another delinquent car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In\nlate 2001, she traded in a car she originally bought in October 1998. The terms of her\npurchase required her to pay $1,000 down and add the balance due on the trade-in to\nthe financing for the new car. About two or three months later, Applicant was told she\nhad to return the new car because there were irregularities (not otherwise specified) in\nthe way the dealer had handled the title (it was a used car). Applicant was refunded her\n$1,000 down payment, but the trade-in was not returned. Her understanding at the time\nwas that the loan for the trade-in had been satisfied with the financing of the new car.\nThis debt appears only on the first credit report obtained during her investigation. (Gx. 2\n- 5; Tr. 49 - 55)\nApplicant paid the debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.f in February 2009. (Answer to SOR)\nThis debt was apparently related to a tax payment deficiency. She borrowed against an\nanticipated tax refund, but the actual refund was less than what she borrowed. (Tr. 64 -\n66) The debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.d is for an unpaid medical bill for the treatment of one of\nher children at an emergency room around 2003. Applicant insists she had medical\ninsurance at the time that should have covered the bill. She has been aware of this debt\nsince 2003, but has been unable to verify the status of this debt, which still appears on\nher credit report as of December 2008. (Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr. 56 - 61)\nIn 2000, Applicant was at a family reunion at a location which was about eight\nhours away by car to the north of where she lives. At some point during the reunion,\nApplicant and two distant cousins drove to another city about 110 miles farther north,\nwhere one of the cousins went into a bank and cashed a fraudulent check for $29,000.\nApplicant later received a $1,100 check from one of the cousins. \nIn testifying about this event, Applicant has claimed (1) that she did not know that\nthey had actually gone to another state when the relative went into the bank; (2) that\nshe did not know what the relative was doing; (3) that, although she grew up with one of\nthe relatives, she did not know her real name until the FBI started investigating the bank\nfraud scheme; and (4) that she was only joking when she told her relative that she could\nuse some money. (Tr. 66 - 72, 75 - 76) As alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 2.a, Applicant was\narrested and charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud in March 2002. She\ncompleted a pre-trial diversion program and made restitution. On completion of the pre-\ntrial diversion program in May 2004, the charge was dismissed. (Gx. 2)\nAfter she was arrested, Applicant was required to travel several times to the city\nwhere her relative had cashed the check. Applicant lost her job as a result of having to\nbe gone frequently, but she insists she left the job by mutual agreement with her\nemployer. (Tr. 72 - 75) On November 16, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a\ngovernment investigator during her background investigation. She stated during the\ninterview that she could not make payments on a car note (SOR \u00b6 1.b), because \u201cshe\nwas terminated from her employment due to required travel...relative to [her] federal\narrest...\u201d (Gx. 2) \nWhen Applicant submitted her SF-85P, she listed her federal arrest, but she did\nnot disclose that she was terminated from her job after she was arrested (SOR \u00b6 3.a) or\nthat she owed any of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6 3.b). As to her\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n5\nnegative answer to SF-85P question 12, Applicant claimed she left her job by mutual\nagreement with her employer, because of frequent travel required in connection with her\narrest. Question 12 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been fired, quit\nafter being told she would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations\nof misconduct or following allegations of unsatisfactory performance, or for other\nreasons under unfavorable circumstances. (Gx. 1)\nAs to her negative answer to SF-85P question 22, Applicant asserted she was\nfocused on the disclosure of her arrest and forgot to list her debts. (Answer to SOR) At\nthe time she completed the SF-85P, Applicant was aware she had delinquent debts\nwithin the meaning of question 22. (Tr. 78 - 79) That question asked whether, in the\nprevious seven years, Applicant had any debts more than 180 days past due, or\nwhether she was currently more than 90 days past due on any debt(s). She explained at\nthe hearing that she \u201cfailed to mark [the questions] on the form. I missed them.\u201d (Tr. 79) \nHowever, the SF-85P submitted as Gx. 1 was completed by hand. At questions\n12 and 22, as with several other questions, Applicant took the time to put an \u201cX\u201d in the\n\u201cNo\u201d box, and she entered \u201cN/A\u201d in boxes for entering details of an affirmative response.\nIn response to Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination, Applicant offered that,\nbecause she disclosed her 2002 federal conspiracy charge, she had nothing to gain by\nwithholding other adverse information. (Tr. 79 - 80)\nOther than the tax-related debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant has not paid or\ntaken other steps to resolve any of her debts. She makes about $2,000 net each month,\nwhich she estimates leaves her about $100 after monthly expenses. (Tr. 89 - 92) After\nshe was hired for her current job in 2007, Applicant contacted a financial counseling and\ndebt management company. But she has not actually enrolled in any debt repayment\nprogram or received any financial management counseling. (Tr. 92 - 93)\nI was able to assess Applicant\u2019s demeanor and her credibility at the hearing. I did\nnot find credible her explanations of the circumstances which led to her arrest for\nconspiracy to commit bank fraud. For example, it is implausible that she would grow up\nwith a relative but not know her name, or that she did not know where she and her\ncousins were going the day the $29,000 check was cashed. I also did not believe her\nexplanation of the car financing transaction that resulted in the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.c. Her\nfailure to document such an unusual circumstance further undercuts her credibility.\nPolicies\nEach trustworthiness decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n7\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n6\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to sensitive\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline E (personal conduct), at AG \u00b6 15, Guideline F (financial considerations), at\nAG \u00b6 18, and Guideline J (criminal conduct), at AG \u00b6 30.\nA trustworthiness determination is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n8\nhave access to automated sensitive information. The government bears the initial\nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to\ndeny or revoke a position of trust for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be\nable to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden,\nit then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. A\nperson who has access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.9\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\n\n Directive, E3.1.14.\n10\n7\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nBy admitting to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g, the government was relieved of its burden of\nproving those allegations as fact. By denying \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.e, the burden\nremained with the government to prove those allegations.  The record evidence (the\n10\ngovernment\u2019s exhibits, Applicant\u2019s various SOR admissions, and her testimony at the\nhearing) is sufficient to support all of the SOR allegations. The facts established show\nthat Applicant accrued significant delinquent debt between February 2003 and\nDecember 2008. All of the debts, except for the tax-related debt at SOR \u00b6 1.f, remain\nunresolved and Applicant is not able to resolve her debts given her current financial\ncondition. Available information also shows that Applicant participated in a conspiracy to\ncommit bank fraud, from which she personally profited. The foregoing requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts), AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and AG \u00b6\n19(d) (deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft,\ncheck fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan\nstatements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust).\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant has claimed that all of her\ndebts arose due to unforeseen events, such as unemployment, a death in the family,\ninsurance mistake, theft, and fraud. However, despite being given ample opportunity to\nproduce information that would support what are essentially affirmative defenses to the\ngovernment\u2019s information, she has not provided anything that supports her claims. As to\nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, the record warrants consideration of the mitigating condition\nat AG \u00b6 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) as it pertains to her father\u2019s passing and her brief\nperiod of unemployment in 2003. However, Applicant\u2019s loss of that job was due to her\ncriminal conduct. Further, there is no information showing she has acted responsibly in\nthe face of her delinquent debts regardless of the cause. Because all but one of her\ndebts remain unresolved, because she has not acted on her intentions to seek financial\ncounseling, because she has not documented her claimed disputes of debts in her\ncredit history, and because her current finances are not sufficient to resolve her debts,\nnone of the other mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 apply. Applicant has failed to\nmeet her burden of persuasion in response to the adverse information about her\nfinances.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant denied the allegations that she deliberately falsified her SF-85P when\nshe omitted the fact that she was terminated from her job after she was arrested in\n2002, and omitted the fact she is more than 180 days past due on debts over the past\nseven years. However, the government\u2019s information (Gx. 1, Gx. 2, Applicant\u2019s\n\n8\nresponse to the SOR, and her testimony) was sufficient to support the SOR allegations\nabout her personal conduct. As stated at AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe summary of Applicant\u2019s November 16, 2007, subject interview represents\nthat she told the government investigator she was terminated from her job due to her\n2002 arrest for conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Applicant was presented with the\nsummary before her hearing and had the opportunity to correct the summary. She\nacknowledged that the summary was accurate. She testified that she and her employer\nat the time of her arrest agreed she should leave her job given the requirement she\ntravel frequently in response to her arrest. I do not accept Applicant\u2019s benign\ncharacterization of what happened, as she was obligated to disclose her termination\nbecause of the associated allegation of wrongdoing. \nAs to her omission of her debts, there is no question she was aware of her debts\nat the time she completed the SF-85P. However, Applicant\u2019s claim that she overlooked\nthis part of her SF-85P makes no sense in view of the fact that she handwrote her\nresponses and decided to enter \u201cN/A\u201d in parts of the form. The fact that she disclosed\nher arrest did not relieve her of the basic obligation to fully and accurately disclose all\nrelevant information in her background. All of the information bearing on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a\nand 3.b supports a conclusion that Applicant intentionally withheld the information in\nquestion. Accordingly, the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. By contrast,\nApplicant\u2019s lack of credibility at the hearing, precludes application of any of the available\nmitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17. On balance, Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns raised by her deliberate omissions from her SF-85P.\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant admitted the allegation that she was arrested in 2002 on federal\ncharges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. This information raises a security concern,\naddressed in AG \u00b6 30; that is, criminal conduct \u201ccreates doubt about a person's\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d More\nspecifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying conditions at\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and AG \u00b6 31(c)\n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).\n\n See footnote 7, supra.\n11\n See footnote 9, supra. \n12\n9\nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s arrest is not recent and she has not been involved in any\nsuch conduct since then. This requires consideration of the mitigating conditions at AG\n\u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and AG \u00b6 32(d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of\ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement).\nHowever, the passage of time without further adverse conduct is not sufficient\nhere. In assessing the applicability of the mitigating conditions, I have considered\nApplicant\u2019s lack of credibility in discussing the events surrounding her arrest, as well as\nher deliberate falsification of her SF-85P. These aspects of her conduct preclude a\nconclusion that she is not likely to disregard laws or regulations in the future, that she is\nsuccessfully rehabilitated, or that her past conduct does not currently cast doubt on her\njudgment and reliability. On balance, I conclude she has not mitigated the security\nconcerns about her past criminal conduct.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E, F, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is a\n33-year-old single mother of two and is presumed to be a mature responsible adult. She\nis a reliable worker and has been recognized for her work in support of the military\u2019s\nhealth care system. However, the favorable information in her background is insufficient\nto overcome the security concerns about her lengthy history of bad debt, her criminal\nconduct, and her deliberate falsification of her SF-85P. These facts and circumstances\npresent an unacceptable risk were she to be granted access to sensitive information. A\nfair and commonsense assessment  of all available information about the Applicant\u2019s\n11\nbackground shows there are still doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as her own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved for the government.12\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e, 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3: Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a position of trust. Eligibility for access to sensitive\ninformation is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations concerning his alcohol consumption, and denied the criminal and personal conduct allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings. Applicant is a 56-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor. He has worked for his present employer since 1981, shortly after he honorably completed a four-year enlistment in the Navy. He has held a security clearance since 1997. He is married, with five adult stepchildren. (GE 2 at 6, 11, 13, 16-19, 24, 31; AE F; AE G; Tr. at 8-10.) In 1979, while serving in the Navy, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He refused the Breathalyzer test and, after a contested trial, was convicted of DUI, placed on probation, and fined $300. (AR; GE 1 at 2; Tr. at 54.) On July 10, 2004, Applicant and his wife attended a private party at which he consumed multiple beers. His wife drove them home after the party, then he decided to go out and have some more beer at a local restaurant. As he departed the restaurant parking lot, he hit a curb and another parked vehicle, then left the scene. He was arrested and tested at .11 blood alcohol content (BAC). He was charged with DUI and Hit and Run of an Unattended Vehicle. He paid a $500 fine, and his sentencing was otherwise deferred for five years on condition that he have no alcohol or drug violations, participate in a recovery program, and attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) in 1979, 2004, and\n2007. He completed two outpatient treatment programs, but relapsed after the first and\nconsumed alcohol during the second. He is on probation until August 2010. Security\nconcerns were insufficiently mitigated. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on May 14, 2008. On April\n29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol\nConsumption), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nNovember 23, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 7, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on May 26, 2009 (AR), and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 12, 2009, and the case\nwas assigned to me on June 23, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 24,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 25, 2009. The Government\noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\noffered exhibits (AE) A through K, which were also admitted without objection, and\ntestified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nSeptember 1, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the factual allegations\nconcerning his alcohol consumption, and denied the criminal and personal conduct\nallegations. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings. Applicant is a\n56-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor. He has worked for his\npresent employer since 1981, shortly after he honorably completed a four-year\nenlistment in the Navy. He has held a security clearance since 1997. He is married, with\nfive adult stepchildren. (GE 2 at 6, 11, 13, 16-19, 24, 31; AE F; AE G; Tr. at 8-10.)\nIn 1979, while serving in the Navy, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.\nHe refused the Breathalyzer test and, after a contested trial, was convicted of DUI,\nplaced on probation, and fined $300. (AR; GE 1 at 2; Tr. at 54.)\nOn July 10, 2004, Applicant and his wife attended a private party at which he\nconsumed multiple beers. His wife drove them home after the party, then he decided to\ngo out and have some more beer at a local restaurant. As he departed the restaurant\nparking lot, he hit a curb and another parked vehicle, then left the scene. He was\narrested and tested at .11 blood alcohol content (BAC). He was charged with DUI and\nHit and Run of an Unattended Vehicle. He paid a $500 fine, and his sentencing was\notherwise deferred for five years on condition that he have no alcohol or drug violations,\nparticipate in a recovery program, and attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.\n(GE 3 at 2; GE 4 Interview (PSI) at 1-2; Tr. at 53, 62-63.)\nOn August 23, 2004, Applicant was evaluated at a court-approved chemical\ndependency treatment center, and was determined to be alcohol dependent by the\nclinical director. From September 11, 2004, to December 17, 2006, he successfully\ncompleted an outpatient treatment program at the center, and was discharged with a\n\u201cgood\u201d prognosis. He also attended several AA meetings per week from July 2004 to\napproximately July 2007. From January to December 2004, Applicant completed his\nassociate\u2019s degree. From August 2005 to September 2006, he took more online classes\nand earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. (AR; GE 4 PSI at 2-3; GE 5\nat 21-40; AE A; Tr. at 66-70.)\nApplicant resumed drinking alcohol in July 2007, mostly consuming a couple\nbottles of wine on weekends. On September 9, 2007, he had consumed about a bottle\n\n3\nof wine when his grandson called in tears, and asked Applicant to come and get him.\nHe was unfamiliar with the location of his stepdaughter\u2019s home, and while he was trying\nto read the written directions his wife gave him, he ran off the road into a ditch and hit a\nfence. He was able to back out of the ditch and leave the scene, but was subsequently\narrested by police while cruising slowly trying to locate a street. He consented to a\nBreathalyzer test at the police station, resulting in BAC readings of .082 and .084.\nApplicant was then charged with DUI and Hit and Run of Unattended Property. Due to\npolice errors, the BAC results were suppressed and Applicant pled guilty to, and was\nconvicted of, the lesser offense of First Degree Negligent Driving and the Hit and Run.\nOn August 12, 2008, the county court sentenced him to serve 90 days in jail (with 89\ndays suspended), to pay a fine of $866, to pay restitution for damages he caused to the\nfence, to complete an alcohol assessment, and to serve two years of probation (expiring\non August 12, 2010), and ordered to consume no alcohol or other mood altering drug\nnot prescribed by a doctor among other conditions of probation. These offenses also\nviolated the conditions of his deferred sentencing agreement for his 2004 DUI and Hit\nand Run convictions. Accordingly, on August 5, 2008, the municipal court imposed a\nsentence of 365 days in jail (with 364 days suspended), a $5,000 fine (with $4,650\nsuspended), $791 in costs, and 12 months of probation for the 2004 offenses. That\nprobation was completed on August 5, 2009. (GE 3 at 2; GE 4 PSI at 3-4; GE 5 at 4-6;\nTr. at 50-54, 71-72.) \nApplicant completed his court-ordered alcohol assessment on September 13,\n2007, at a different recovery center. He was found to be alcohol dependent in relapse.\nHe entered an outpatient relapse treatment program at the facility on October 15, 2007,\nand successfully completed it on August 12, 2008. In connection with this treatment\nprogram, he signed an agreement with the recovery center on October 24, 2007, to\nremain abstinent from alcohol and all other mood-altering substances. (AR; GE 5 at 7-\n20; Tr. at 50, 54-55.)\nApplicant consumed alcohol on two occasions after he entered the treatment\nprogram in 2007. In November 2007, his uncle passed away. He returned to his family\nhome in another state for the funeral, and consumed some wine during the dinner and\nwake. During June 2008, he also returned to his family home for a nephew\u2019s wedding.\nHe drank four to six beers during the reception. (AR; AE B; GE 4 PSI at 4; GE 5 at 3;\nTr. at 39-40, 54, 72-73, 75.)\n In the first set of DOHA interrogatories to which Applicant responded, he was\nasked when he had last consumed alcohol. He replied, on November 28, 2008, that his\nlast consumption was in June 2008, at his nephew\u2019s wedding. He also said that he had\nnot consumed any alcohol in any form since that date. (GE 4 at 4.) DOHA sent\nApplicant another set of interrogatories in January 2009, including a question asking\nwhether he had consumed any alcohol since June 2008. Applicant responded \u201cyes,\u201d\nand indicated that he had done so twice. The first incident he reported was the\nnephew\u2019s wedding in June 2008, and the second was his uncle\u2019s funeral, which he\nmistakenly stated took place on November 27, 2008. (GE 5 at 3.) In fact, this funeral\noccurred on November 27, 2007. (AE B.) Applicant continued his confusion about the\n\n4\ncorrect date during his hearing testimony, but has consistently denied any intent to\ndeceive or conceal his alcohol consumption during the wake dinner. His self-report of\nthis consumption is the only available evidence that it occurred. Applicant did not falsify\nhis response to the first set of DOHA interrogatories because his nephew\u2019s wedding\nwas more recent than his uncle\u2019s funeral. He honestly but mistakenly reported what he\nthought to have been subsequent alcohol use when responding to the second set of\ninterrogatories. \nApplicant lives in a nice, well-kept home. He comes from a large family, and has\nworked a second career in his own home construction and remodeling company over\nthe years. (AE C; AE D; AE E; Tr. at 38-41.) Group leaders from two AA groups\nApplicant regularly attends wrote letters describing his active and positive participation\non a regular basis. Nine coworkers and friends also wrote letters on his behalf,\nexpressing their high opinions of his character and trustworthiness. (AE H.) Two more-\nsenior managers, who were unable to attend the hearing and prohibited by company\npolicy from writing letters, expressed their willingness to vouch for his character via\ntelephone. (AE J; Tr. at 45-47.) Applicant\u2019s wife and stepson also wrote letters\ncomplimenting his good character and recent progress within AA. (AE I.) Finally,\nApplicant submitted a credit report documenting his financial responsibility. (AE K.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\n\n5\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DCs). The DCs supported by the SOR allegations and asserted by\nDepartment Counsel are:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program; and \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol rehabilitation program.\nApplicant\u2019s three admitted DUI offenses clearly raise security concerns under AG\n\u00b6 22(a). Although his latest conviction reflected the lesser included offense of First\nDegree Negligent Driving, he admitted driving with a BAC in excess of .082, and was\nsufficiently impaired to have driven into a ditch and collided with a fence. He was\n\n6\nevaluated as alcohol dependent by the licensed chemical dependency professional\nsocial workers at both treatment clinics he attended, supporting application of AG \u00b6\n22(e). Finally, he admitted relapsing into regular alcohol consumption in July 2007,\nabout eight months after completing his first alcohol rehabilitation program. This\nconsumption continued until his latest DUI arrest in September 2007. He also\nconsumed alcohol in November 2007 and June 2008, in violation of the agreed terms of\nhis second outpatient alcohol rehabilitation program. Therefore, AG \u00b6 22(f) also\nsupports security concerns. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s multiple DUI arrests preclude a finding that the behavior was\ninfrequent, and his 2007 DUI remains relatively recent. He resumed drinking after each\nof his first two DUI convictions, despite successful completion of a lengthy outpatient\ntreatment program in December 2006. His resumed abstinence since his 2007 DUI is of\ninsufficient duration to establish that such conduct is unlikely to recur or no longer casts\ndoubt on his reliability. Applicant could not yet establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(a).\nApplicant has acknowledged his alcoholism, and has begun to demonstrate effective\naction to overcome it, but he has yet to establish a pattern of abstinence sufficient to\novercome concerns raised by his previous relapses. \n\n7\nThere is no evidence that he has consumed alcohol since June 2008, and he has\nmade a substantial start toward establishing a pattern of responsible conduct and\nabstinence. However, as discussed above, insufficient time has passed to establish\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 23(b) given the duration, pattern, and seriousness of his history\nof alcohol abuse. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence yet to support mitigation under\neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) or (d), due to his history of relapses and the lack of evidence of a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or qualified social worker.\nHe is taking proper and commendable measures to create future mitigation under these\nprovisions, but has not yet done so sufficiently to overcome the security concerns raised\nby his history and pattern of alcohol abuse.\n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The three DCs asserted by the Government and supported by the SOR\nallegations are: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) the individual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d (Tr. at 169.) \nApplicant admittedly committed, and was arrested for, three separate DUI\noffenses in 1979, 2004, and 2007. The most recent two incidents also included hit and\nrun on unattended property charges. He was convicted of DUI for the first two, and of a\nlesser included, negligent driving offense for the third incident because of police errors\nin gathering the evidence. His latest arrest violated the terms of his probation for the\nsecond conviction, and he remains on probation until August 2010 if he avoids\ncommitting further criminal offenses. The evidence fully supports security concerns\nunder the DCs set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c), and (d). \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. These are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n\n8\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nFor mitigation analysis, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed criminal conduct and his criminal\nhistory must be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. His multiple DUI offenses\ndemonstrate a willingness to flaunt rules and regulations. Given the lengthy and\nrepetitive nature of his criminal history, Applicant did not establish strong mitigation of\nthe concerns arising therefrom. His alcohol relapse leading to a subsequent DUI offense\nshortly after completing his first alcohol treatment program, and use of alcohol on two\nseparate occasions during his second treatment program, preclude substantial\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a). His offenses were frequent and similar enough that\ninsufficient time has passed to support a reasonable conclusion that recurrence is\nunlikely or his judgment has permanently improved. He made no showing that he was\npressured or coerced into any of his criminal acts to support application of AG \u00b6 32(b).\nAlthough he is alcohol-dependent, that fact has not changed and each of his DUI\noffenses was preceded by totally voluntary consumption of excessive alcohol. \nApplicant admitted that he committed each SOR-listed criminal offense, and he\nwas formally convicted for each incident, so AG \u00b6 32(c) has no application. Applicant\u2019s\nlengthy and excellent employment record, and his abstinence from alcohol since\nsuccessful completion of his latest outpatient treatment program in August 2008,\nprovide evidence that begins to demonstrate rehabilitation. The recency and repetitive\nnature of his criminal activity, however, leads to the conclusion that on balance it is still\ntoo soon to be confident that such behavior is unlikely to recur, and no longer casts\ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. These facts preclude a finding of\nsubstantial mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(d).\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n9\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The potentially disqualifying condition alleged in this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant denied that he deliberately or knowingly falsified relevant information\nabout his alcohol consumption. His November 28, 2008, interrogatory response was not\nfalse. His March 2009 interrogatory response was erroneous because he confused the\ndate of his uncle\u2019s funeral as November 2008 when it was actually in November 2007.\nThese facts are consistent with Applicant\u2019s July 11, 2008, disclosure during his security\ninterview, that he drank at his uncle\u2019s November 2007 funeral and his nephew\u2019s June\n2008 wedding. The record does not support application of AG \u00b6 16(a), nor does it raise\nany personal conduct security concerns other than general reliability and\ntrustworthiness issues already addressed under Guidelines G and J.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n10\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involves multiple DUI offenses over the past thirty years, including two since\nJuly 2004. All occurred while he was mature and accountable for his actions. None of\nthe incidents in and of itself was particularly serious since he was fortunately arrested\nbefore hurting himself or others. The latter two did involve damage to other people\u2019s\nproperty, however. Taken together, these offenses form a pattern reflecting very poor\njudgment, flaunting of rules and regulations, and inadequate self-control. He knowingly\nand voluntarily participated in every incident of security concern, and failed to take\nnecessary steps to change the circumstances under which his problems recurred until\nfairly recently. It has been just over two years since his most recent offense, and he\nremains on probation until August 2010. The substantial suspended punishment facing\nApplicant for another criminal violation lessens the degree to which his recent good\nbehavior can be attributed to real remorse and rehabilitation. While evidence of an\nexcellent start toward establishing rehabilitation was presented, including his recent\noutstanding work performance, lifestyle changes and abstinence from alcohol, it is too\nsoon to confidently conclude that continuation or recurrence of his criminal conduct or\nalcohol problems are unlikely. He made insufficient showing of reduced potential for\npressure, exploitation, or duress.\nOverall, the record evidence generates substantial doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Although his recent efforts have\nbeen commendable, he has not yet met his burden to mitigate the security concerns\narising from his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant*\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n*Excepting the date, \u201cNovember 27, 2008,\u201d and substituting therefore the date,\n\u201cNovember 27, 2007.\u201d\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance.

Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn September 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial considerations, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E,\npersonal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 20, 2009, admitting all of the SOR\nallegations except 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.n, and 3.a. She requested a hearing, and the case was\nJuly 22, 2010\n\nThe SOR alleges nine arrests for check-bouncing. SOR subparagraphs 2.c through 2.e are duplicates, as\n1\nare SOR subparagraphs 2.f and 2.g.\n2\nassigned to me on January 26, 2010. On March 2, 2010, DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing scheduling the case for March 22, 2010. Before the hearing date, Department\nCounsel informed me that Applicant was on disability leave and that DOHA was unable\nto confirm whether she received the notice of hearing. I postponed the hearing and\narranged a scheduling conference for March 30, 2010. That day, the parties agreed to\nreschedule the hearing for April 28, 2010. The notice of hearing was mailed on April 8,\n2010. \nAt the hearing, Applicant moved to continue the hearing. (Tr. 17) I denied the\nmotion, and the hearing was held as scheduled. I received five Government exhibits,\nfive Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record\nopen at the conclusion of the hearing to allow her to submit additional exhibits. Within\nthe time allotted, she submitted 13 additional exhibits that I received as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits F through R. DOHA received the transcript on May 7, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old single woman with two children, ages 10 and 11, and\nthree stepchildren. Two of the stepchildren are adults and one is a teenager. (AE O) A\nprior marriage ended in divorce in 2005. The father of her children is her ex-husband.\nTheir relationship began in 1995 and they married in 2003. \nApplicant has earned some college credits. (GE 1 at 11) Since March 2008, she\nhas worked as a project management analyst for a defense contractor. She has worked\nin this field for the past eight years. (GE 1 at 10-13) Her duties include, among other\nthings, maintaining electronic schedules and creating communication plans for\nmanagement. (AE L)\nApplicant is highly respected on the job and in her community. According to her\nsupervisor, she has a \u201cwealth of knowledge,\u201d and brings \u201cgreat energy to her position.\u201d\n(AE. L) She is active in her sons\u2019 little league football program in ways \u201cthat far exceed\nthat expected of any coach/team parent.\u201d (AE N)\nBetween 2001 and 2008, Applicant wrote checks drawn from bank accounts with\ninsufficient funds or from bank accounts that she knew were no longer open. She wrote\nmost of the bad checks to purchase food for her children. She wrote others to procure\nsupplies for her then-boyfriend, the man she later married, to help him with his\nconstruction business. (GE 4 at 13) These criminal activities led to five arrests, as\nalleged in the SOR.  (Answer, SOR subparagraphs 2.a - 2.j) The outcome of the\n1\ncriminal proceedings is unknown from the record. \n\nSOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.j are duplicates. SOR subparagraphs 1.h and 1.l are duplicates, and SOR\n2\nsubparagraphs 1.b and 1.w are duplicates.\n3\nApplicant also accrued approximately $58,000 of delinquent debt during this\nperiod, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.x.  Approximately $36,200\n2\nconsists of delinquent home mortgage payments. (SOR subparagraph 1.t) The\nremainder consists primarily of credit card bills, utilities, and delinquent home rental\npayments.\nThe delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a was owed to a furniture rental\ncompany in the amount of $392. (Tr. 39) By January 2010, Applicant had satisfied this\ndebt through a wage garnishment. (Tr. 39)\nApplicant owed the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b to a furniture\ncompany in the amount of $425. (Tr. 40) By August 2007, Applicant had satisfied this\ndebt through a wage garnishment. (AE G) \nApplicant owes the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d to a utility company in\nthe amount of $781. She has been making regular monthly payments since December\n2009, and has reduced the balance to $313. (AE H)\nApplicant owes the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.t to the mortgage\ncompany that financed her house. Approximately $36,000 is delinquent, and the\nmortgage balance is $302,000. (Tr. 54) In January 2008, Applicant wrote the mortgage\ncompany and requested relief through the short-sale process. (Tr. 85) Since then, the\nmortgage company has been attempting to execute a short-sale on Applicant\u2019s behalf.\n(Tr. 85) Applicant has not made any mortgage payments for more than a year and a half\nwhile the short-sale has been pending. (Tr. 85)\nAs of the hearing date, Applicant had made minimal efforts to either satisfy any of\nthe remaining SOR delinquencies or develop a payment plan. Some of the debts have\nbeen delinquent for as long as seven years. (Tr. 41) On May 16, 2010, Applicant began\nworking with an online credit counseling company. She has not yet been assigned a\ncounselor (AE I)\nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband is approximately $23,000 behind on his child support\npayments. (AE E)  She is currently seeking to recover it through court action. (Tr. 117)\nApplicant has not filed her state or federal income taxes for either tax years 2008\nor 2009. (Tr. 121-122) She is not concerned about filing her income taxes because she\nanticipates receiving refunds. (Tr. 122)\nApplicant\u2019s financial troubles were aggravated after a car accident in 2004\nrendered her unable to work for six months. (Tr. 92) Applicant also attributes her\nfinancial struggles to clinical depression together with her troubled former marriage. (Tr.\n38) In 2008, when Applicant\u2019s depression was at its peak, she was lethargic and unable\n\n4\nto focus. (Tr. 122) She has been on disability leave since November 2009. (Tr. 78; AE\nA) She was \u201cbasically bed-bound\u201d through February 2010. (Tr. 10) While on disability\nleave, she receives two-thirds of her salary. (Tr. 79)\nCurrently, Applicant is receiving treatment for her depression. According to her\nphysician, \u201cthe cyclical nature of her impairments\u201d that triggered her symptoms will be\nless likely to recur \u201conce the symptoms are successfully controlled with medication and\npsychotherapy.\u201d (AE J) Applicant has been progressively improving. (Id.)\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in July 2008. She was\nrequired to disclose any arrests, charges, or convictions that had occurred within seven\nyears of completing the application. (GE 1 at 25) She disclosed an arrest that occurred\nearlier that year, but did not disclose any earlier arrests, charges, or convictions. She\ncharacterized the omissions as unintentional oversights. (Tr. 116) She disclosed other\nadverse information on her security clearance application including two civil domestic\ncases involving allegations against her of domestic violence. Also, she comprehensively\ndiscussed her history of delinquent debt. Under the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section of\nthe application, Applicant stated as follows:\nI have made mistakes in the past, but have worked very hard to separate\nmyself from the past mistakes over the past 7+1/2 years. I\u2019ve always\nworked hard and have made great strides along the way to improve my\nlife. . . . though I\u2019ve stumbled, I try to walk the line.\nIn July 2009, Applicant verbally reprimanded her teenage stepdaughter for being\ndisobedient. (Tr. 100) A heated argument ensued, which became physical after\nApplicant \u201cpopped\u201d the stepdaughter, and \u201cshe hit back.\u201d (Tr. 101) The police then\narrived, arrested Applicant and charged her with child abuse and second degree\nassault. (Tr. 102) The court dropped the child abuse charge. As for the assault charge,\nApplicant received probation before judgment. (Tr. 103) Under the terms of the\nprobation, the court placed the case on its inactive docket and the charge will be\ndropped so long as Applicant attends counseling and stays out of trouble for a year. (Tr.\n103) \nWhen Applicant reported this episode to her psychiatrist, she discovered that\nsome of the medication she was taking when it occurred causes aggressive behavior.\n(Tr. 104) The psychiatrist then stopped prescribing these medications. (Tr. 105)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The\n\n5\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant satisfied the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, and has\nbeen making steady payments to satisfy the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d. I\nresolve these allegations in her favor.\nAny probative value stemming from Applicant\u2019s satisfaction of SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a and1.b has minimal probative value because they occurred through\nwage garnishments. Moreover, the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d\ntotal approximately $2,000, which is less than four percent of the amount that remains\noutstanding. Further, Applicant has no plan to satisfy the remaining delinquencies, and\njust enrolled in credit counseling two weeks after the hearing.\nApplicant\u2019s financial struggles were exacerbated by a 2004 car accident that\ndisabled her from working for six months, a troubled marriage, and a years-long battle\nwith clinical depression. The depression also impeded her ability to confront her\nfinancial problems after the delinquencies accrued. Based on these personal problems,\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is potentially applicable. Applicant, however, did\nnot act responsibly as her finances got out of control. Instead, she wrote multiple checks\nfrom accounts that she knew had insufficient funds, or had been closed. Moreover, she\n\n6\nhas made marginal efforts to begin satisfying her delinquent debts, to date. Neither AG\n\u00b6 20(b), nor any of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15)\nApplicant was arrested multiple times between 2001 and 2009, and is currently\non probation. AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6\n31(d), \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation,\u201d applies.\nApplicant\u2019s most recent crime, the assault of her stepdaughter was partially\ncaused by her stepdaughter\u2019s truculence and the side-effects of the medication\nApplicant was taking to control her depression. Applicant is a good employee who is\nactive in the community, volunteering in her sons\u2019 little league football program. AG \u00b6\n31(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement,\u201d applies.\nRegardless of the factors that may have contributed to the episode involving\nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter, she was arrested, and remains on probation. Moreover, so\nlong as Applicant remains financially unstable, the possibility that she may break the law\nby bouncing checks may recur. Applicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct security\nconcern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern under this guideline is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose all of her arrests on the security clearance application\nraises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\n\n7\nApplicant comprehensively addressed all of her other adverse background\ninformation on the security clearance application including delinquent finances and\nunalleged, domestic civil complaints. She used the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section of\nthe security clearance application to discuss what she characterized as a history of\nmistakes. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s characterization of the omission of\nsome of her arrests as unintentional was credible. I conclude Applicant did not falsify\nher security clearance application, and that there are no personal conduct security\nconcerns.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant has not demonstrated a sufficient track record of financial reform to\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. Moreover, not enough time has\nelapsed from her last episode of criminal conduct to mitigate the criminal conduct\nsecurity concern. Applicant\u2019s depression contributed greatly to the accrual of her\ndelinquencies, her failure to take concrete steps to satisfy them, and her most recent\nepisode of criminal conduct. She is undergoing treatment, and her physician is\noptimistic. Despite the cause of her financial problems and most recent criminal\nconduct, her delinquencies are simply too significant to conclude that they do not pose a\nsecurity concern. Considering this case in the context of the whole-person concept, I\nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nPARAGRAPH 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.x - 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.k:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 7, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On December 16, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge mis-weighed the record\nevidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a program manager for\na Government contractor, a position he has held for approximately 1 \u00bd years.  He holds a B.S.\ndegree.  He has served in the Reserves and in the National Guard.  He was granted a security\nclearance in 1993 while serving in the Guard.  Applicant has been married and divorced twice.  He\nhas four daughters and pays $800 per month on behalf of the younger two.  \nFrom 1997 to 2001 Applicant experienced financial problems.  As a consequence, he was\ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002.  In 2007 Applicant purchased a home as an investment.\nHe took out a $38,000 mortgage on the home, as well as two other loans, for an additional $27,000.\nThe mortgage went into foreclosure and the debt secured by the mortgage note was unsatisfied as\nof the close of the record, as is one of the two others, for $20,000.  Applicant has experienced marital\nproblems, divorcing his second wife in 2007.  In November of that year, Applicant was advised by\nhis employer that he would be transferred to another unit in the company, which would entail moving\nto another location.  Applicant turned down the transfer and had to leave the company.  Applicant\ndoes not have a second job.\nIn the Analysis portion of her decision, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s marital difficulties, as\nwell as the fact that he was not able to sell his investment home due to the downturn in the real estate\nmarket, both of which were circumstances outside his control.  However, she also noted that\nApplicant turned down a transfer, resulting in loss of employment, knowing that he had significant\nfinancial obligations, which raises questions about his judgement.  She stated that he has not had\nfinancial counseling for many years, has no plan for systematically paying off debts, and, in fact, has\na negative cash flow each month.  As a consequence, she concluded that Applicant had failed to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial problems.\nWe conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)  Furthermore, we find no basis to conclude that the Judge\nmis-weighed the record evidence.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighted the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10238 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2009).\nWe note, for example, that although the Judge considered the fact that Applicant had financial\n\n3\ncounseling 10 to 15 years ago, she explained why he had not demonstrated  responsible action in\nregard to his mortgage difficulties, which are more recent.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant executed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on March \n11, 2008. He resigned his SF-86 on February 19, 2009. On July 7, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nDecember 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 29, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 31, \n2009. I convened a hearing on October 5, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 5 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced six exhibits, which \nwere identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through F. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. I left the record open until October 13, 2009, so that \nApplicant could provide additional information for the record.   \n \nOn October 23, 2009, Applicant filed six additional documents, which were \nmarked as Ex. G through L and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 13, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied the eight allegations. The Government conceded that its documents \nestablished that the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. was satisfied before the SOR was \nissued and was therefore  alleged in error. (Ex. 5 at 30; Tr. 107-108, 160-161.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and employed as a program manager by a government \ncontractor. In 2001, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in management \ninformation. He has worked for his present employer for approximately 1\u00bd years. From \n1987 to 1995, he served in a state National Guard unit. In 1995, he enlisted in another \nbranch of military service, where he served in the active reserves until 2001. He was \nfirst awarded a security clearance in 1993. (Ex. 1; Tr. 46-47, 53-54, 59.) \n \n \n  Applicant has been married and divorced twice. He is the father of four \ndaughters. His first daughter was born in 1984. Applicant and the child\u2019s mother did not \nmarry. Applicant married another woman in 1988. He and his wife had a daughter, born \nin 1989. Applicant and another woman had a child together in 1993. In 1995, Applicant \nand his wife had another daughter together. In 1996, Applicant and his wife divorced. \n(Ex. 1; Tr. 47-49.) \n \n \nApplicant married for the second time in 2002. He and his second wife separated \nin September 2007 and divorced in July 2009.  No children were born to the marriage. \nApplicant pays approximately $800 a month in child support to the mothers of the two \nyounger daughters, who are now 16 and 14.  (Tr. 47-48, 52.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nFrom 1997 to 2001, Applicant was self-employed as a computer consultant. He \ndid not manage the business receipts carefully, and, as a result, he underpaid his state \nincome taxes and incurred tax liens. He entered into a payment plan and satisfied about \n$10,000 of an estimated $20,000 in delinquent taxes. His financial problems continued, \nand, in February 2002, he petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He was granted a \ndischarge of his debts in August 2002. The debts discharged in the bankruptcy totaled \napproximately $39,000. Applicant\u2019s 2002 bankruptcy was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.g. (Ex. 1; \nEx. F; Tr. 84-85, 107-111, 115-121.)   \n \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant purchased a home as an investment property. To \npurchase the home, he took out three loans: a first mortgage for $38,000; a home \nimprovement loan for $20,000; and an additional line of credit tied to the first mortgage \nfor $7,000. His plan was to refurbish the property and then sell it. (Ex. 3 at 1; Tr. 122-\n123.) \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant and his second wife separated. He was ordered to \npay her $700 a month in spousal support.  He paid the spousal support for one or two \nmonths, and then fell into arrearages that amounted, at the time of his divorce, to \n$2,617. The divorce decree provided that any arrearages owing at the time of the \ndivorce would be waived. Applicant is responsible for paying his former wife $700 in \nspousal support until February 2010.  (Ex. C; Tr. 51-52, 75-76, 85-86.)  \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant\u2019s employer advised him that he would be \ntransferred to another unit in the company. Applicant did not accept the transfer, and he \nhad to leave the company. His annual gross salary was then approximately $50,000.  \nHe moved to another location and worked part-time as a consultant for the firm which \nnow employs him full time. (Tr. 77-80.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage on the investment property went into foreclosure. He had \nbeen offered a payment plan to prevent foreclosure, but he lacked sufficient funds to \nparticipate in the payment plan. About one year ago, Applicant sent a monthly payment \nof $459 to the mortgagee. The check was not accepted and was returned. As of the \ndate of his hearing, he owed $38,375 on his first mortgage and $20,000 on the home \nimprovement loan,1 which had also foreclosed.  The home mortgage debt is alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.d., and it remains unsatisfied. (Ex. 4; Tr. 97-98, 129.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.a. that Applicant owed $7,070 to the creditor who \nprovided him with a line of credit tied to his first mortgage. In his answer, Applicant \ndenied the debt.  At his hearing, he explained that he owed the debt but had been \nmaking payments on the debt. He provided a payment agreement showing that he had \ncommitted to pay $500 in July 2009 and $547.56 each month beginning August 2009. \nAdditionally, he provided a copy of the front and back of a check he had made out to the \ncreditor on September 24, 2009, for $547.56. He did not provide proof of payment of \n \n1 The home improvement loan debt was not alleged in the SOR. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n$500 in July 2009, and he did not provide proof of payment of $547.56 in August 2009.2 \n(Ex. A; Tr.61-70.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant was indebted to a state agency for a \ncollection account in the amount of $4,279. Applicant identified this delinquency as his  \nspousal support arrearage debt. He provided documentation to corroborate his \nstatement that the arrearage debt had been extinguished by his final decree of divorce, \ndated July 24, 2009. (Ex. B at 26; Tr.73.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.c. that Applicant owed a debt of $2,434 to a state social \nservice agency for arrearages in his child support. Applicant provided documentation to \nestablish that the agency had garnished his wages to satisfy the debt, and it had been \npaid down so that only $257 of the original debt remained to be satisfied. (Ex. B at 18; \nTr. 88-97.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.f. and \u00b6 1.g. that Applicant owed two state tax liens of \n$560 each. At his hearing, Applicant provided documentation to establish that both liens \nhad been satisfied in April 2007. (Ex. E at 8-10; Tr. 112-114.)  \n \n   Applicant\u2019s net monthly salary is $3,393. His monthly rent is $1,150, which he \npays to his mother, with whom he lives.3 In addition, he has the following monthly fixed \nexpenses: groceries: $200; clothing and dry cleaning: $150; cable: $100; car insurance \nfor his car and his mother\u2019s car: $250; life and other insurance: $250; spousal and child \nsupport: $1,500;4 miscellaneous: $100. (Tr. 140-146.) \n \nOn the personal financial statement he provided in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories in November 2008, Applicant identified two credit card debts and a \ncharge card debt that he paid regularly. The first credit card obligation identified by \nApplicant (Debt A) reflected a balance of $4,000. Applicant reported that he paid the \ncreditor $150 each month on the debt. The second credit card obligation (Debt B) \nreflected a balance of $2,500, and Applicant reported that he also paid the creditor $150 \neach month on that debt. The third debt, a charge card (Debt C), reflected a balance of \n$1,000. Applicant reported that he paid that creditor $100 a month. These debts were \nnot alleged as delinquent on the SOR. (Ex. 2 at 4; Ex. 4 at 2.) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated that he paid $547 each month on the line of \ncredit debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. He also stated that he made monthly payments of \n$100 on Debt A, $60 on Debt B, and $50 on Debt C. Applicant\u2019s monthly fixed expenses \n \n2 In a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided a letter from the lender stating that his balance on the \naccount on October 13, 2009 was $5,475.63. (Ex. I.) \n \n3 Applicant stated that his mother did not need his rent to pay her mortgage, and she sometimes excused \nhim from his monthly rental obligation. (Tr. 140-141, 145-146.) \n \n4 In February 2010, Applicant will no longer be obliged to pay $700 each month in spousal support.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nand his monthly debt payments leave him with a net monthly remainder of -$1,064. (Tr. \n125-128, 147-149.) \n \nApplicant noted that his $700 spousal support obligation would end in February \n2010. He also observed that his child support obligation for his 16-year-old daughter \nwould end on 2011, and his child support obligation for his 14-year-old daughter would \nend in 2013. He acknowledged that he provided his 19-year-old daughter with $100 \neach month and would likely provide some reduced support to his other daughters after \nhe was no longer obligated to provide them with child support. (Ex. 2 at 4; Tr. 150-151.)  \n \nApplicant does not have a second job. He had consumer credit counseling \nbetween 10 and 15 years ago, but he has had no financial counseling since that time. \n(Tr. 155-156.) \n \nApplicant provided letters of character reference from two co-workers who found \nhim to be trustworthy and reliable. His employer provided a letter for the record stating \nthat his salary would be increased from $50,000 a year to $110,000 a year if he were \ngranted a security clearance. (Ex. D; Ex. G; Ex. H; Tr. 56.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Additionally, \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may \nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to- \nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis\u201d can also raise concerns about an \napplicant\u2019s financial stability and ability to protect classified information. Applicant \naccumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable or unwilling to pay his \ncreditors. His monthly budget shows a negative monthly remainder of -$1,064. This \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties date at least to his bankruptcy in 2002. In 2007, \nhe purchased a house as an investment. That same year, he and his second wife \nseparated, and he lost his job when he elected not to accept a transfer. He could not \nmeet his mortgage payments on the house, and he was unable to sell it because of the \ndownturn in the housing market. While Applicant was directly affected by the downturn \nin the real estate market and was subject to events beyond his control, he also elected \nto purchase a property to renovate and sell as an investment. When his employer \nsought to transfer him to another unit in the company, he left his job, knowing that he \nwas responsible for two mortgages on his investment property as well as spousal and \nchild support. Applicant acquired another job within months of leaving his job in 2007.  \nHe has been employed by his present employer for 1\u00bd years. The $38,000 mortgage \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. remains unsatisfied, and Applicant\u2019s expenses exceed his \nincome each month by over $1,000. \n \nTo his credit, Applicant provided documentation that established that he had  \npayment plans in place for the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.c. He also provided \ndocumentation to corroborate his statement that he no longer owed the spousal support \narrearage alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b.  Additionally, he provided documentation to corroborate \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhis assertions that the tax liens alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g had been satisfied. The \n2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h. is not, in itself, a disqualifying \ncondition under the Directive.   \n \n Applicant\u2019s spousal and child support obligations, his mortgage payments, and \nhis monthly fixed expenses and credit card debt payments caused him to become \nfinancially overextended. His monthly expenses exceed his income, and he has few \nresources available to pay them at this time. He hopes to pay his creditors in the future, \nbut his current financial situation casts doubt on his ability to plan realistically for the \nfuture.     \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling for many years. While he \nadmitted his financial delinquencies, it was not clear that he understood his financial \nproblems or how to resolve them. He has no plan in place to systematically resolve his \nsubstantial delinquent debt and prepare for future contingencies. I conclude that while \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply in part to Applicant\u2019s case, none of the other Financial \nConsiderations mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 42 \nyears. His skills and abilities are appreciated by his employer and co-workers. He has \nacted in good faith to resolve many of his delinquent debts. \n \nHowever, his financial problems date to at least 2002, when he was granted a \ndischarge in bankruptcy and thereby acquired a fresh start in his financial life. In spite of \n\n \n9 \n \n \nrecent serious financial difficulties, he has not sought financial counseling. His lack of \nattention to his financial delinquencies continues to raise security concerns. \n \nApplicant is unable to meet his financial obligations and finds that his expenses \nexceed his income by approximately $1,000 each month. He has a $38,000 mortgage \ndebt that is unresolved. He only recently began making payments on his line of credit of \n$7,000. He owes $20,000 on a home improvement loan. While his mother sometimes \nallows him to put off paying his monthly rent to her, his financial situation remains \nprecarious. It is not clear that he can continue to meet his obligations to satisfy the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. or that he has the financial resources to satisfy the mortgage debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. He has not sought additional employment to supplement his \nincome, and he lacks a realistic plan to satisfy his financial obligations, raising concerns \nabout his judgment and potential financial vulnerability. \n \nApplicant may find it beneficial to seek professional financial counseling and legal \nadvice about resolving his debts and acquiring financial stability in the near term. \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this decision \nbecomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new evidence that addresses the \nGovernment\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I \nconclude, after a careful review of the facts of his case, the Financial Considerations \nadjudicative guideline, and the whole person analysis, that Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his financial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n           Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e. through 1.h.: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \n                                    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Applicant is a 40 year old Army Veteran, who is employed as an electronic technician in the defense industry (TR at page 28 line 21 to page 30 line 1). As a result of his military service, he suffered injuries during jumps in airborne operations (TR at page 30 line 3 to page 31 line 24). He also suffers from Barrett\u2019s Disease, \u201cthe erosion of the esophagus with lesions and growths on the inside of the esophagus,\u201d which he attributes to taking anti-nerve gas pills while stationed in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and to the resulting airborne debris from a scud missile attack (Id, TR at page 27 line 3 to page 28 line 12, and AppX C).

On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 20, 2009.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing on April 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on April 28, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on May 1, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on May 29, 2009.  The Government offered\nExhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified\n\n2\non his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through D, without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 3, 2009.

It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to creditor B in the amount of\nabout $92 (GX 3 at page 13).  The Applicant is unaware of this debt; but in an\nabundance of caution and pursuant to the advice of counsel, it has been included in\nApplicant\u2019s May 2009, Bankruptcy filing (TR at page 43 line 5 to page 44 line 15, and\nAppX C Schedule F at page 2).\n1.c.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to creditor C in the amount of\nabout $55 (GX 3 at page 7).  The Applicant is also unaware of this debt; but in an\nabundance of caution and pursuant to the advice of counsel, it has been included in\nApplicant\u2019s May 2009, Bankruptcy filing (TR at page 44 line 19 to page 45 line 10, and\nAppX C Schedule F at page 1).\n\n3\n1.d.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to creditor D in the amount of\nabout $13,509 (GX 3 at page 9).  The Applicant is unaware of this debt; but in an\nabundance of caution and pursuant to the advice of counsel, it has been included in\nApplicant\u2019s May 2009, Bankruptcy filing (TR at page 45 lines 11~23, and AppX C\nSchedule F at page 1).\n1.e.  Lastly, the Applicant is indebted to creditor F in the amount of about $9,903,\nwhich he believes is a consolidated credit card debt (TR at page 45 line 24 to page 46\nline 6, and GX 3 at page 12).  This debt has been included in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\nfiling (AppX C Schedule F at page 2).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n4\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  During his extended period of unemployment\nor underemployment, the Applicant accumulated his delinquent debt.  These are clearly\ncountered by the Mitigating Conditions found in Subparagraphs 20(b) and 20 (d).  Under\nSubparagraph 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . .\n. unexpected medical emergency . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.@  Furthermore, Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.@ Here, the Applicant, by filing for the protection of a Chapter 7\nBankruptcy, has addressed all of the alleged past due debt.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n5\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Here, he has the\nunqualified support of a colleague (AppX E).  This colleague avers, in part, the\nfollowing:\nI have personally worked in the defense industry since 1973 and have\ncarried a US security clearance throughout my career.  Working with . . .\n[the Applicant] daily, we have had many discussions about the importance\nof the roles we both play in maintaining a strong national defense system,\nand I am quite comfortable being a character reference for . . . [the\nApplicant].  It is my opinion that . . . [the Applicant\u2019s] moral fiber and strong\npatriotism make him a highly trusted and reliable contributor to our\ndefense efforts (AppX E).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his financial considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 6, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nconcerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), G (Alcohol Consumption), and E \n(Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 24, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 25, 2009, was provided to him, and he \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did submit information within the 30-day time \nperiod after receiving a copy of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 7, \n2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 2.a., \nwhich he denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old technical writer, who has been employed by his \ndefense contractor employer since May 2008. Applicant attended a community college \nfrom August 1999 to May 2003 and was awarded an associate of arts degree in May \n2003. He has never married and has no dependents.3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation included a review of his May 2008 e-QIP,4 \nhis May 2008 FBI Report, his December 2008 Response to Interrogatories, and his \nFebruary 2009 Response to SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement/Alcohol Consumption/Personal Conduct \n \nThe Government established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and/or evidence \npresented that he used cocaine from about 1994 to June 2008 and purchased cocaine; \nused marijuana from about 1994 to January 2006, tested positive for marijuana in \n \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n2 DOHA transmittal letter is dated March 25, 2009; and Applicant received the FORM on April 2, \n2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted a letter dated April 23, 2009, which was within the 30-day time \nperiod after receipt of FORM. \n3 Item 5. These facts were derived from Applicant\u2019s May 2008 e-QIP. \n4 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nFebruary 2006, and purchased marijuana; used LSD from about 1994 to about 2001, \nand purchased LSD; and used ecstasy from about 1996 to about 1999, and purchased \necstasy. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.d.) In February 2006, he tested positive for illegal drug use \nduring his 12-week AA program to reinstate his driver\u2019s license following his driving \nunder the influence (DUI) arrest, discussed infra.5 Medical treatment records reveal that \nApplicant was diagnosed with Cannabis Abuse (DSM IV 305.20) by a Certified \nAddiction Professional (CAP) in May 2006, that he successfully completed his treatment \nprogram, and that he was recommended for \u201ctotal abstinence from mind altering \nsubstances, continue involvement with AA & sponsorship.\u201d6 Applicant continues to \nconsume alcoholic beverages as he stated in his December 2008 Response to \nInterrogatories.7 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 2.c.) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM, which was a letter dated April 23, 2009, he \ntook exception to the May 2006 CAP comments contained in her discharge summary: \n \nAlso, in regards to [treatment facility] and my counselor [] I noticed in my \nreport written by her that there was mixed information of someone else \nand my own put together in the report, which I believe makes my report \nlook worse then (sic) it should be. As well as that I was never asked by \n[treatment facility] or even my probation officer to further continue to take \ncounseling. If they had asked I would have gone on my own free will. I did \nlearn from my previous classes. \n \nApplicant did not provide any documentation supporting his contention of error in his \ntreatment facility discharge summary.  \n \nThe Government established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and/or evidence \npresented that he consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to intoxication, from \napproximately 1995 to at least December 2008. In his Personal Subject Interview, \nApplicant indicated he started drinking alcohol in high school when he was 17 or 18 \nyears old.8 He further indicated that \u201c[p]robably two weekends out of a month he drank \nto intoxication: and \u201c[e]ither drove himself home or his friends drove him.\u201d9 As noted \nsupra, Applicant continues to consume alcoholic beverages. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI of alcohol or \ndrugs first offense. He refused the breathalyzer and pled nolo contendere to the DUI \noffense, which was reduced to reckless driving.10 Applicant was sentenced to three \n \n5 Item 4 at 13. \n \n6 Item 6 at 6-9.  \n \n7 Id at 13. \n \n8 Item 6 at 20. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nmonths supervised probation, required to attend DUI Level 1 class and victim \nawareness program, and ordered to pay a fine and court costs. (SOR \u00b6 2.b.)  \n \n \nApplicant signed his e-QIP on May 6, 2008. He incorrectly responded \u201cNo\u201d or did \nnot provide complete and accurate information in his response to a question pertaining \nto past drug use. Section 24 of his e-QIP (SOR \u00b6 3.a.) asked: \n \nSection 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity  a. Since the \nage of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, \ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, \ncodeine, heroin, etc.) amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, \nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), \nor prescription drugs. \n \nIn his Response to SOR, Applicant stated: \n \nI admit that I knowingly falsified information on the [defense contractor] job \napplication regarding the use of illegal drugs. I deeply regret this action \nand my only defense was that my father was present during the on-line \napplication procedure and since he was unaware of the drug issue, I was \napprehensive to tell him about it at that moment. I obviously regret that \ndecision and have since informed him of what occurred. My actions were \nfoolish and wrong. I should have been honest with both my father and \n[defense contractor].11 \n \nIn his Response to SOR, Applicant provided a number of character statements to \ninclude his state representative, work supervisors, colleagues, and parents. These \ncharacter references were very favorable attesting to his positive work habits, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. With the exception of his parents, none of those persons made \nreference to having knowledge of Applicant\u2019s extensive drug and alcohol use. \n \nAlso in his Response to SOR, Applicant stated, \u201cI sincerely apologize for my \nmomentary lapse of judgment and hope that I be given an opportunity to redeem \nmyself.\u201d He repeated this statement in his Response to FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n11 Item 4 at 6. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d12 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).13 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement/Alcohol Consumption/Personal Conduct \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline H, the Government\u2019s concern is: \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24. \nUnder Guideline H, there are four Disqualifying Conditions raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconduct: AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany drug abuse . . . ;\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding . . . purchase . . . ;\u201d AG \u00b6 25(e) \u201cevaluation of drug abuse . . . by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program;\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 25(h) \u201cfailure to clearly and convincingly to commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d \nThe Government established these Disqualifying Conditions through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented. \n \nUnder Guideline G, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nUnder Guideline G, there are three Disqualifying Conditions raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconduct: AG \u00b6 22(a) \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, . . . or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\u201d AG \u00b6 22(c) \n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless \nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 22(e) \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d The \nGovernment established these Disqualifying Conditions through Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand evidence presented. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nUnder Guideline E, the Government\u2019s concern is: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nUnder Guideline E, there is one Disqualifying Condition raised by Applicant\u2019s \nconduct: AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d The Government established this Disqualifying Condition through \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. \n \nAs noted supra in his Response to SOR, Applicant provided a number of \ncharacter references. Considering the nature, recency, and security implications arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s substantiated misconduct, Applicant has not met his burden of \nestablishing any of the mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, G, and E. Given the \nrecency of his cocaine use, which occurred after his treatment program, Applicant has \nfailed to provide persuasive evidence that he has put his illegal drug usage behind him. \nApplicant\u2019s character references much be weighed in light of their intrinsic value and \nrecord evidence as a whole.14 In doing so, the Appeal Board has stated, \u201cit is not a \nsimple matter of considering whether other people expressed favorable opinions about \nApplicant, but rather: (a) whether the favorable opinions about Applicant are reasonable \nand well-founded; and (b) and what weight reasonably can be placed on such favorable \nopinions in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d15 \n \nFurthermore, the Appeal Board has stated: \n \nIn the face of Applicant\u2019s serious criminal conduct \u2013 which involved \ndeception and deceit directed against the federal government . . . \u2013 the \nfavorable character statements had to be viewed with a grain of salt and \ndiscounted somewhat. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0083 (January 10, \n1997) at p. 4 (favorable reputation for honesty and reliability must be \ndiscounted in face of proven acts of falsification.16 \n \n \n14 ISCR Case No. 97-0727 at 4, n. 1 (App. Bd.

Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the \nwhole person concept was given due consideration, and that analysis does not support \na favorable decision. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d19 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 2.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 Snepp v.

On February 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 3, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 1, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for June 16, 2009. The case was heard on that \ndate. The Government offered four exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 4 without objection. Applicant testified and offered no exhibits. The \nrecord was held open until July 1, 2009 to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments.  Applicant timely submitted two documents. Appellant Exhibit (AE) A is a \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n20-page document. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE A is marked as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. AE B is a three-page document. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE B \nis marked as HE II. The transcript was received on June 24, 2009. Based upon a review \nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old share point administrator employed with a Department \nof Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor since June 2008. He attended two years of community college. From \nSeptember 1985 to February 1990, he served in the National Guard. This is his first \ntime applying for a security clearance. He is married and has two sons, ages 34 and 16. \n(Tr at 5-6, 17; Gov 1) \n   \nOn June 17, 2008, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions \n(SF 86). (Gov 1) He disclosed several delinquent debts in response to section 27 and \n28 on his questionnaire. A subsequent background investigation confirmed that \nApplicant had the following delinquent accounts:  a $9,243 balance resulting from an \nautomobile repossession that was placed for collection in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov \n2 at 9; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 1); a $57 medical account that was placed for collection \nJune 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 10; Gov 3 at 4); a $125 medical account that was \nplaced for collection in February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 8); a $35 medical account \nthat was placed for collection in November 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 3 at 8); \nand a $100 medical account that was placed for collection in March 2006. (SOR \u00b6 1.e:  \nGov 2 at 10)  \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $53 medical account that was placed \nfor collection in November 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 11); a $513 credit card account \nthat was charged off in October 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 3 at 5); a $1,618 credit card \naccount that was placed for collection in June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 3 at 5); a $119 \nmedical account that was placed for collection in March 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at 6); \nand a $6,671 credit card account that was placed for collection in May 2008.

(SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov \n3 at 9) \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in April 2001. He was laid off from a job \nwhere he earned $75,000 a year.  After he was laid off, he received unemployment \ncompensation of $225 a week but it did not meet the family expenses.  He found \n\n \n3 \n \n \nemployment in October 2001 but his annual income was reduced to $36,000. His \nemployer did provide health insurance. Applicant worked in this position for six years. \nHe was unable to pay his older debts because of his reduced income. He currently \nearns $75,000 in his current job. (Tr at 18, Gov 2 at 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019 wife suffers from chronic health problems and is unable to work. She \nhad surgery in 2005. They have incurred several medical bills in relation to his wife\u2019s \ntreatment. Of the 13 debts alleged in the SOR, seven of the debts are medical bills. (Tr \nat 18, 34-35; Gov 2 at 4)  \n \nIn response to interrogatories on December 26, 2008, Applicant provided a \npersonal financial statement. His net monthly income is $4,457. Monthly expenses \ninclude: a mortgage payment: $1,105, groceries: $1,100, utilities: $900, clothing: $120, \ncar expenses: $300, medical: $160, insurance: $27. His total monthly expenses are \n$3,712. Applicant also owes his son $8,800. The debt arose from a failed joint small \nbusiness venture. He pays him $200 a month towards this debt. He owes the IRS \napproximately $11,538. This is a debt owed for tax year 1999. Applicant was working as \na 1099 contractor and made a mistake with regard to paying his taxes. The IRS applies \nhis income tax refunds towards this debt and he currently makes $230 monthly \npayments towards this debt. The total amount he pays out each month is $4,142. After \nexpenses, he has $315 left over each month. (Tr at 22-23, 33; Gov 2 at 6) \n \nIn 2004, Applicant and his wife moved in with his mother-in-law. All three of their \nnames are on the mortgage. They attempted to refinance their home in order to use the \nmoney to pay off their bills but they did not qualify. They decided that they had no \nalternative but to file for bankruptcy. During the hearing, Applicant testified that he filed \nfor bankruptcy in January or February 2009. The record was held open until July 1, \n2009, to allow Applicant to submit a complete copy of his bankruptcy filing. In his post-\nhearing submission, he indicated that they had not filed for bankruptcy but had retained \na bankruptcy law firm on January 26, 2009. He provided a receipt indicating that he paid \nthe bankruptcy firm a retainer to represent him. (Tr at 19-21; AE A at 20) In a later \nsubmission, Applicant provided a list of creditors that were to be listed in his bankruptcy \ncase. The bankruptcy law firm provided this list. (AE B) At the close of the record, it is \nunclear whether Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy case has been filed and whether the bankruptcy \nwill be under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. \n \nSeven people wrote reference letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The general manager \nof Applicant\u2019s company wrote that during his 13-month period of employment, Applicant \nhas had access to sensitive company records to include proprietary and commercially \nsensitive intellectual property. He describes Applicant as mature, stable, and \nprofessional. He does not question Applicant\u2019s integrity, loyalty or commitment. (AE A at \n2) Another co-worker describes Applicant as reliable and utterly loyal.  Applicant can \nalways be counted on to do the right thing. (AE A at 3)  \n \nThe national treasurer of a nonprofit organization that supports and funds the  \nfamilies and children of deceased special operations military personnel states that \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant volunteers as the web-master for the organization. He states that Applicant \nspent countless hours working to improve and maintain the security of the club\u2019s \ninternet connections without compensation. He recommends Applicant as a man of high \ncharacter who can be trusted. (AE A at 4) \n \nOther references describe Applicant as \u201clevel-headed, industrious with an \nunusually active and rigorous work ethic\u201d; \u201cforthright knowledgeable and dependable, \nyet, easy to work with\u201d; and \u201ca consummate professional.\u201d (AE A at 5-7) His oldest son, \na Staff Sergeant in the Army, states that his father has a giving and generous nature. \nHis honesty is above reproach. (AE A at 8) \n \nA performance evaluation from Applicant\u2019s previous place of employment, dated \nJuly 16, 2007, indicates Applicant exceeded the standards. The evaluation describes \nApplicant\u2019s strengths as being \u201ca leader, an outstanding technician, and a hard working, \ndedicated team player.\u201d (AE A at 14-19)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \nApplicant has accumulated 13 delinquent accounts since 2001, an approximate total \nbalance of $24,532.   \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. All of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent accounts were unresolved at the close of the record. Applicant incurred \nnumerous delinquent accounts over an eight-year period. While Applicant retained a \nbankruptcy attorney with the intent to file for bankruptcy in January 2009, a formal filing \nhas not occurred at the close of the record. It cannot be determined at this time that \nApplicant\u2019s debts will be discharged in bankruptcy. Given his history of financial \nirresponsibility, it is too soon to conclude Applicant developed a track record of financial \nstability. FC MC \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are the result of being laid off in 2001, a seven month period of \nunemployment, and significant reduced income upon finding employment. His wife\u2019s \nmedical issues also created additional expenses.  The second prong to consider under \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. While \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his inability to pay his debts. He \nhas been gainfully employed since October 2001. In June 2008, Applicant received a \nsignificant increase in pay but claims he was unable to resolve any of his accounts. \nWhile his wife\u2019s illness created additional medical expenses, he had health insurance \nsince October 2001. Of the 13 delinquent accounts in the SOR, seven accounts were \nmedical accounts placed for collection, all of which were under $150. Applicant had the \nability to resolve these accounts. For this reason, I give FC MC \u00b6 20 (b) less weight.    \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not received financial counseling. He is in the \nprocess of filing for bankruptcy but the outcome of such a filing is uncertain. \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. At the close of the record, \nApplicant retained a bankruptcy firm but had not filed for bankruptcy. While bankruptcy \nis a legitimate way to resolve one\u2019s debts, it is too soon to conclude that his debts will \nbe discharged. Considering his past financial history it is also too soon to conclude \nApplicant will remain financially solvent even if his debts are discharged in bankruptcy. \nMore than half the delinquent debts were under $150. They were medical accounts. \nSeveral accounts had balances as low as $35, $57, $53, and $100. Applicant could \nhave made the effort to resolve these accounts. In June 2008, he received over a \n$30,000 annual pay increase when he started his current job, yet he made no effort \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntowards resolving these minimal accounts.  It is premature to conclude Applicant made \na good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s manager, co-worker, former co-workers and friends. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s loss of employment in 2001 and his acceptance of a job with a \nsignificantly reduced income. I considered his wife\u2019s chronic health issues. While \nApplicant is in the process of filing for bankruptcy, he has not formally filed. An \nadditional concern was raised because Applicant made no attempt to resolve the \naccounts that were under $150 after receiving a significant raise in June 2008 when he \nbecame employed in his current position. While Applicant may develop a track record of \nfinancial responsibility in the future, it is premature to conclude his financial situation has \nbeen resolved. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On January 14, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 13, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge ignored record evidence\nfavorable to Applicant and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  In addition, the Board raises a jurisdictional issue.  For reasons set\nforth below, we remand the case to the Judge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant has three delinquent debts, two of which are for real estate\nmortgages, for which he had not provided sufficient evidence of mitigation to warrant the grant of\na security clearance.  In addition, the Judge found that, after the issuance of the SOR, Applicant\u2019s\ngovernment-contractor employer (contractor) terminated his employment because of security\nconcerns, and Applicant has been unemployed since then.   Decision at 5.  The record contains a\n1\ndocument entitled a \u201cPerson Summary,\u201d apparently obtained from the Joint Personnel Adjudications\nSystem (JPAS).  This document states that Applicant left contractor\u2019s employ in March 2009.  The\nrecord contains no explanation as to if, when, or how the \u201cPerson Summary\u201d was entered into the\nrecord.  Although it is not consistent with Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony as to the date he lost his job,\nboth Applicant\u2019s testimony and the JPAS document indicate that the job loss occurred well before\nthe commencement of the hearing in this case.\nAlthough neither party raised subject matter  jurisdiction as an issue in this case, it can be\nraised sua sponte by the Board, which is authorized \u201cto consider and resolve the threshold issue of\nwhether there is subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a particular security clearance case under\nthe Directive.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-24227 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2003).  The Directive provides that\nactions commenced pursuant to it \u201cshall cease upon termination of the applicant\u2019s need for access\nto classified information except in those cases in which . . . a hearing has commenced . . . [a]\nclearance decision has been issued; or . . . [t]he applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended and the\napplicant provided a written request that the case continue.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 4.4.  Applicant testified that\nhis former employer wanted to hire him back if he could get a clearance, and that it was \u201csponsoring\u201d\nhis efforts to obtain one.  Tr. at 96.  However, record evidence and the JPAS document permit a\nreasonable inference that DOHA had actually been divested of jurisdiction prior to the hearing and\nthat further processing of the case should have ceased.  \n\n3\nAlthough the Board is authorized to resolve jurisdictional questions, due to the ambiguities\npresented by the record, the appropriate course is to remand the case to the Judge for additional\nproceedings.  Therefore, we remand the case to the Judge to reopen the record to allow the parties\nto present evidence as to the facts and circumstances regarding the jurisdictional issue outlined\nabove, including the question of whether Applicant still possessed a need for access to classified\ninformation by the time of the hearing.  Other issues raised by Applicant on appeal are not ripe for\nadjudication.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

On January 14, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJuly 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn February 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 26, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on April 14, 2009. The government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 23).

His admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. After a \nthorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor \nand testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old entrepreneur (franchise owner) seeking employment \nas a network engineer with a defense contractor. In June 1991, he completed an \nassociate\u2019s degree in business administration. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in \nfinance in June 1994. He is currently enrolled in a master\u2019s degree program in service \nmanagement of information systems. He needs to complete three additional courses to \nreceive his master\u2019s degree (Tr. 6-7, e-QIP). He has no military service. Applicant has \nbeen married since 1998. He has three children of this marriage, ages 17, 10, and 6.  \n \nApplicant worked almost six years for a federal agency; initially as a \u201cpolitical \nstay-in-school student,\u201d and after graduating from college as a disaster assistance \nemployee (Tr. 35). Between December 1997 and September 2005, he worked in the \ninformation technology (IT) field for various government contractors.  \n \nApplicant testified he never had any financial problems before September 2005 \n(Tr. 27-28). From 2001 to 2005, he earned approximately $450,000 working for \ngovernment contractors (Tr. 93). Both he and his wife were working full time in the IT \nbusiness and they were doing well financially. Their children were in private schools. \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThey bought a minivan in 1999, their residence in 2001, a Chevy Tahoe in 2004, a \nrental townhome in 2005, his business in 2006, and a used BMW in 2006 (Tr. 92). \n \nAround September 2005, Applicant believed the IT business was going soft. His \nIT contract had ended, and he decided to use his savings to start his own business. He \npurchased a fire and water restoration company franchise and opened the business in \nNovember 2005. The business did well in 2006, and \u201cpretty good\u201d in 2007. His wife quit \nher IT job in November 2006, and ran the administrative part of the business. Applicant \ndedicated himself to the production and marketing aspects of his new business. By the \nend of 2007, his business was not doing well because of the world-wide downturn of the \neconomy.  \n \nApplicant blames all of his current financial problems on his failing business. He \nand his wife used their line of credit accounts and credit cards to pay for their payroll \nand other business expenses, as well as for all of their family\u2019s day-to-day living \nexpenses. Applicant strongly denied his financial problems were caused by any lavish \nor extravagant lifestyle (Tr. 29-31).  \n \nIn May 2008, because of his business\u2019 financial downturn, Applicant sought \nemployment with a government contractor. In July 2008, he submitted a security \nclearance application in which he disclosed having problems meeting his two mortgages \nand other financial obligations. His background investigation addressed his financial \nstatus and included the review of August and December 2008 credit bureau reports \n(CBRs), and Applicant\u2019s answers to a November 2008 DOHA interrogatory.  \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $20,523, which have been delinquent for a number of years. Concerning \nthe SOR allegations he explained that: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($158) is a debt for wireless services from 2003-2004. Applicant \nclaimed his wife had twice paid this debt. He presented no documentary evidence to \nsupport his claim. He paid the debt in April 2009 (Tr. 39, AE 1). Applicant explained he \ndid not know this debt was indicated as delinquent until he was confronted with it by the \nbackground investigator in December 2008. Being so close to his security clearance \nhearing, he elected to pay the debt again instead of disputing it (Tr. 41). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,789) is a debt for a line of credit account Applicant\u2019s wife opened \nwithout his knowledge to pay for both their business and family\u2019s day-to-day expenses, \nincluding the payroll (Tr. 57-58). The debt is in collection by a collections\u2019 company. \nApplicant claimed he found out about it in November 2008. He recently paid $2,213, \nand still owes around $4,500. The creditor has agreed to settle the debt for $2,250, \nprovided Applicant pays the debt by the end of April 2009. \n \nApplicant also owes approximately $18,000 to a credit union (not alleged in the \nSOR) (Tr. 56). This debt was for a line of credit and credit card account Applicant\u2019s wife \nopened without his knowledge to pay for both their family\u2019s and business\u2019 day-to-day \n\n \n4 \n \n \nexpenses. In January 2009, Applicant asked the credit union to consolidate the line of \ncredit and credit card account into one account (AE 1). He also proposed to settle the \naccount for one-half of the remaining balance. As of his hearing date, he had not \nreceived an answer to his proposal (Tr. 59). \n \nApplicant testified he is no longer using the line of credit and/or credit card to pay \nfor their business\u2019 expenses. He reduced his overhead expenses by laying off most of \nhis employees. He and his wife are now doing most of the business\u2019 work themselves. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($613 past due on a $55,828 second mortgage on his home). This \naccount is delinquent. Applicant plans to address it in May 2009, after his daughter \ngraduates from high school (Tr. 44). Applicant\u2019s three children were attending private \nschools. Because of his financial problems, he moved his middle child to a public school \naround September 2008, but allowed his older daughter and youngest child to stay in a \nprivate school so that they could graduate with their friends. He plans to use the private \nschool tuition money (approximately $1,000) to pay this debt (Tr. 44-47). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($553 past due on a $12,401 car note). Applicant paid $1,400 to bring \nthe account current. His total debt is now $9,439 (AE 1). He owes $568 for his April \n2009 monthly payment. As of his hearing date, he did not have the money to make the \npayment. He expects to pay his monthly installment when he is paid for some of the \nwork he has performed (Tr. 48-49). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($12,338 past due on Applicant\u2019s $359,000 first home mortgage). In \nJanuary 2009, Applicant\u2019s mortgage was in foreclosure. In February 2009, Applicant \npaid $24,936 to bring his mortgage out of foreclosure. He raised the money by \nwithdrawing $11,000 from his 401(k) retirement plan and $14,000 he earned from his \nbusiness (Tr. 95). As of his hearing date, Applicant was late on his March 2009 \nmortgage payment. He testified he will also miss his April and May payments because \nhe does not have the income to pay his debts (Tr. 50-54). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($72) this is a delinquent debt for medical services. He claimed he had \npaid this debt and denied it in the SOR. He paid it in February 2009, to another \ncollection agency (Tr. 55). \n \nApplicant presented evidence of his business\u2019 past earnings, the number of \njobs/contracts performed, and the income he expects to receive when he collects on the \ncompleted jobs/contracts (approximately $35,000) (Tr. 60, 76). His business income is \ninconsistent and he is having trouble collecting on his work. \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant was making around $20,000 to $25,000 a month \nfrom his business (GE 2). At his hearing, he testified he was making between $10,000 \nand $15,000 a month. He and his wife take no salary. All of the business income is used \nto pay for the day-to-day business and household expenses. Applicant\u2019s household \nexpenses total approximately $10,000 monthly (Tr. 75). His business expenses include \n\n \n5 \n \n \npaying his franchise monthly charges, three loans, and vehicles\u2019 maintenance. He owes \na total of approximately $48,000 for his business franchise license and the three loans.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant owes approximately $55,000 on a rental property \n(townhome) he purchased in 2005. The townhome mortgage payment is around $600. \nApplicant rents the townhome for $1,100. As of his hearing day, he was three or four \nmonths late on the townhome mortgage. To his knowledge, the mortgage is not under \nforeclosure. He is delinquent because he cannot afford the mortgage payments (Tr. 91). \nHe also owes approximately $9,000 for his 2004 truck. As of the hearing date, he was \none month behind on his truck payment. \n \nApplicant has had financial problems since late 2006. He has not been making \nenough money through his business to pay his bills and for his family\u2019s day-to-day living \nexpenses (Tr. 98). He and his wife have changed their lifestyle to adjust to their financial \nproblems (Tr. 66). They manage their business from their home. They are moving their \nchildren from private school to public schools. He reduced his overhead expenses by \nreducing his storage rental fees, and his cable, telephone, dry cleaning, and utility bills. \nHe and his family no longer go out to eat, have movie nights, or take vacations. \nApplicant believes his business does not provide a steady, consistent income and he \nplans to sell it as soon as possible. He is looking for a stable job to be able to take care \nof his family.  \n \nTo correct his financial situation, Applicant sought employment with a \ngovernment contractor. He worked for the contractor from July 2007 to September \n2009, and was making $8,000 a month. With his contractor job income and the \nbusiness income he was able to pay most of his bills. He was terminated from his \ncontractor job, and has been unemployed since January 2009, because of the security \nconcerns raised by his current financial situation (Tr. 97).  \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his financial problems. He was candid \nand forthcoming explaining the circumstances surrounding his financial problems. I \nbelieve he is well aware of what is required of him to show that he is reliable, \ntrustworthy, and financially responsible. There is no evidence that Applicant ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n2  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent and/or charged off debts that have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. Of the six delinquent debts alleged, Applicant paid \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($158) and 1.f ($72). He settled and is paying on SOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,789).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s three remaining debts are still delinquent. He has made partial \npayments, but he is still behind on one or more payments. He is delinquent on his \n$55,828 second mortgage on his home (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He is $553 past due on his truck \nnote of $9,439 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He is also $12,338 past due on his $359,000 home first \nmortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Additionally, Applicant is delinquent and owes $18,000 on a line \nof credit and credit card account.  \n \nApplicant does not have the financial means to pay his legal obligations, \ndelinquent debts, and his day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established that his financial problems resulted from circumstances \nbeyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his business \ndownturn. The record suggests Applicant had no financial problems prior to purchasing \nhis business in 2005. He contacted some of his creditors to try to settle his debts. It \ndoes not seem he was living beyond his means, and he has made lifestyle changes to \nadapt to his financial problems. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but does not fully mitigate the \nfinancial concerns. Applicant is financially overextended and his financial problems are \nnot under control.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (c) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing and his financial problems are not yet under control. He did show, however, \nthat he made some good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. The \nremaining mitigating conditions do not apply.  \n \n \nDespite applicability of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d), financial considerations concerns \nare not mitigated. Applicant is financially overextended. He lacks the income to bring his \ndebts to current status. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated \nman, and a good husband and father. He has successfully worked for a defense agency \nand defense contractors while attending college and thereafter. Applicant established \ncircumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts. He has \nmade some effort to resolve his financial problems. \n \nApplicant held a security clearance for a short period of time. There is no \nevidence he has ever compromised classified information or committed any security \nviolations. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his financial mistakes and seems \nresolute in fixing his current financial problems. These factors show responsibility, good \njudgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant became overextended by excessive spending. He \ntook out a second mortgage and borrowed on a substantial line of credit. He purchased \na townhome, and took out a substantial mortgage. His business failed to provide the \nexpected level of income and his debts became delinquent. He still has a significant \ndelinquent debt that he will not be able to bring under control in the near future. He \nbrought his truck out of repossession by making a $1,400 payment, but as of his \nhearing date he was again one month delinquent. He brought his residence out of \nforeclosure by making a $25,000 payment on his first mortgage. However, as of his \nhearing date he was late on his March 2009 payment, and he will not be able to make \nany payments on this mortgage until May 2009. He was also delinquent on his home\u2019s \nsecond mortgage and on his rental property\u2019s mortgage.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s business is not providing sufficient income to keep his debts current. \nHe does not have the financial means to resolve his financial problems. On balance, I \nconclude Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, & 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, & 1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

I find Applicant did possess a \nneed for access to classified information before the commencement of his hearing. \nEven though Applicant was not working in a particular contract or being paid by his \nemployer, Applicant was still being sponsored for a clearance by his employer who \nintended to rehire him.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 14, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \nFebruary 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n1992, as revised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or \nrevoked. \n \nOn February 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 26, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on April 14, 2009. The government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 23). Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 3, which \nwere admitted without objection (Tr. 23). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on April 22, 2009. I issued a decision denying eligibility for access to classified \ninformation on July 13, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant appealed the decision to deny his clearance. On September 11, 2009, \nthe Appeal Board, without addressing Applicant\u2019s appeal issues, sua sponte remanded \nApplicant\u2019s case because of a possible jurisdictional issue.2 The Appeal Board \nremanded Applicant\u2019s case for clarification of the following: \n \n1. How was the document entitled a \u201cPerson Summary,\u201d obtained from the Joint \nPersonnel Adjudications System (JPAS) \u2013 now identified as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) \n1 -- entered into the record;3  \n \n2. Whether Applicant had lost his job before the commencement of the hearing; \nand,  \n \n3. Whether DOHA had lost subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance under Directive \u00b6 4.4.  \n \nThe Appeal Board stated: \n \n \n1  On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) directed application of \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, to all \nadjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended.  \n \n2  ISCR Case No. 08-09776 (App. Bd.

Therefore, we \nremand the case to the Judge to reopen the record to allow the parties to \npresent evidence as to the facts and circumstances regarding the \njurisdictional issue outlined above, including the question of whether \nApplicant still possessed a need for access to classified information by the \ntime of the hearing. Other issues raised by Applicant on appeal are not \nripe for adjudication. \n \nISCR Case No. 08-09776 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2009). \n \n \nOn October 8, 2009, I conducted a hearing to allow the parties to present \nevidence concerning the issues raised by the Appeal Board. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel and Applicant denied presenting App. Ex. 1 during the April 2009 hearing. \nBecause of the DOHA transmittal letter attached to the JPAS Person Summary (App. \nEx 1), I assume the document was placed into the record by administrative personnel \nfrom the Hearing Office, along with other routine documents such as the hearing notice \nand correspondence explaining the Applicant\u2019s procedural rights. \n \n \nAt the October 2009 hearing, Department Counsel presented, without objection, \nthree documents that were marked as App. Ex. 2 through 4. App. Ex. 2 is a letter, dated \nApril 13, 2009, sent by Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) to \nDepartment Counsel requesting that she continue with Applicant\u2019s security clearance \nhearing scheduled for April 14, 2009. The FSO stated in her email: \u201cI will maintain \n[Applicant\u2019s] record in JPAS until a decision has been made about his jurisdiction. He \nlost his job when the loss of jurisdiction happened.\u201d  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel explained that three or four days before Applicant\u2019s hearing \n(scheduled for April 14, 2009), she looked into JPAS to ensure DOHA had jurisdiction \nover Applicant\u2019s case. She noted a JPAS entry indicating Applicant had been separated \nas of March 9, 2009 (App. Ex. 1). Department Counsel telephonically contacted \nApplicant\u2019s FSO for a clarification of Applicant\u2019s employment situation. She was \ninformed that Applicant\u2019s company was still sponsoring Applicant for a security \nclearance. Department Counsel was further informed that the company wanted \nApplicant\u2019s hearing to take place as scheduled, and that the company intended to retain \nor rehire Applicant if he received his clearance (2nd Tr. 10-14). The FSO forwarded App. \nEx. 2 to Department Counsel to memorialize their conversation. \n \n \nAs a result of Department Counsel\u2019s conversation with the FSO, the FSO made \ncorrections in Applicant\u2019s JPAS Person Summary indicating in its pertinent parts: \n\u201cSeparation Status: N/A\u201d and \u201cSeparation Date: N/A\u201d (App. Ex. 3 (The document was \nprinted on April 14, 2009).  \n \nApplicant was terminated from his contractor job in January 2009, when his \nemployer\u2019s contract ended. A second government contractor picked up the contract and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nintended to hire Applicant to continue working in other government contracts. Because \nof the security concerns raised by the SOR, the second contractor declined to hire \nApplicant. The initial government contractor/employer continued sponsoring Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and intended to rehire Applicant if he received a favorable security \nclearance adjudication (App. Ex. 2 and 3). Applicant was unemployed from January \n2009 to his hearing day because of the termination of his employer\u2019s contract and the \nsecurity concerns raised by his current financial situation (Tr. 97).  \n \nApp. Ex. 4 is a JPAS Person Summary for Applicant, with a printed date of \nSeptember 18, 2009, indicating in its pertinent parts: \u201cSeparation Date: 2009 07 14\u201d and \n\u201cSeparation Status: Separation.\u201d My initial decision denying Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance was published July 13, 2009. The transcript for the second hearing (2nd Tr.) \nwas received on October 16, 2009.  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 4.4 provides, that \u201cactions pursuant to [the] Directive shall cease upon \ntermination of the applicant\u2019s need for access to classified information\u201d except in those \ncases in which a hearing has commenced, a clearance decision has been issued, or an \napplicant\u2019s clearance has been suspended and the applicant requested that the case be \ncontinued.  \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I am convinced that Applicant was not \n\u201cseparated\u201d and he was still being sponsored for a clearance by his employer, even \nthough he was not working on a particular contract or being paid. Based on the App. Ex. \n2 and 3, and Department Counsel\u2019s and Applicant's representations, I am satisfied that \nApplicant still had a need for access to classified information. Thus, pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6 4.4, DOHA had jurisdiction when the hearing commenced and as of the date \nof the initial decision. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J.

On September 11, 2009, the Appeal Board, without addressing Applicant\u2019s appeal issues, sua sponte remanded Applicant\u2019s case because of a possible jurisdictional issue.2 The Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case for clarification of the following: 1. How was the document entitled a \u201cPerson Summary,\u201d obtained from the Joint Personnel Adjudications System (JPAS) \u2013 now identified as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) 1 -- entered into the record;3 2.

Therefore, we remand the case to the Judge to reopen the record to allow the parties to present evidence as to the facts and circumstances regarding the jurisdictional issue outlined above, including the question of whether Applicant still possessed a need for access to classified information by the time of the hearing.

King, Esq. \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nThis is a security clearance case in which Applicant contests the Defense\nDepartment\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for an industrial security clearance. The\naction is based on Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems or difficulties. The record\nshows Applicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to the events that\nprecipitated a 1997 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, reappeared during 2002-2003, and came to\na head again in 2007\u20132008, with the start of a home foreclosure. Taken together, these\ncircumstances raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and\ngood judgment, which Applicant did not sufficiently explain, extenuate, or mitigate.\nAccordingly, as explained in detail below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nOctober 21, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on April 1, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F for\nfinancial considerations. The SOR also recommended submitting the case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 19, 2009, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 8, 2009. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nJuly 15, 2009. The record was left open until August 14, 2009, to allow Applicant to\nsubmit additional documentary evidence. At Applicant\u2019s request, and over the\ngovernment\u2019s objections, that deadline was extended until September 3, 2009, and\nextended again until September 25, 2009. \nThe post-hearing matters were timely submitted. They are marked and admitted\nwithout further objections as follows: (1) Exhibit H\u2013payment history for mortgage (11\npages); (2) Exhibit I\u2013motor vehicle title (1 page); (3) Exhibit J\u2013correspondence between\nApplicant and law firm assisting him with disputing information on credit reports (11\npages); and (4) Exhibit K\u2013transaction history for mortgage (5 pages). The hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) was received July 23, 2009. The record closed September 25, 2009.  \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts ranging in amounts\nfrom $31 to $29,562 for a total of about $47,000. Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR were\nmixed. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old field engineer. He has held his current job with a\ndefense contractor since 2003. His employment history includes active duty military\nservice in the U.S. Air Force from 1980 to 2000, when he retired as a senior\nnoncommissioned officer. He worked as an avionics technician in the Air Force, and he\nheld a clearance at the secret and top-secret levels. He now has a secret-level\nclearance, and he is seeking a top-secret clearance for his work on a particular aircraft\nprogram. \n\n Exhibit 4. \n2\n Exhibit 3. \n3\n Tr. 44. \n4\n Exhibit 7. \n5\n Exhibit 3. \n6\n Exhibits 5 and 6. \n7\n Answer to SOR; Exhibits B, C, G, and I.\n8\n Answer to SOR; Exhibits A, G and J.\n9\n3\nHis total compensation is about $89,000 annually. It consists of his salary of\nabout $75,000, retirement pay of about $12,000, and a veteran\u2019s disability payment of\nabout $2,400. His spouse has not worked outside the home since about 1999 or 2000.\nShe just opened a small retail shop, and it is too soon to tell if it will be profitable. \nHis two previous marriages ended in divorce in 1988 and 1993. He married his\ncurrent spouse in 1994. He has no children of his own, but has adult stepchildren from\nhis current marriage.   \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. In 1997,\nApplicant and his wife declared bankruptcy under Chapter 7.  The bankruptcy court\n2\ngranted them a discharge of about $51,000 in total liabilities, of which about $22,000\nconsisted of unsecured debts. In 2003, Applicant attributed the bankruptcy to uninsured\nmedical expenses for his wife and her resulting unemployment as well as bills from his\nprevious marriage.  In his hearing testimony in 2009, he attributed the bankruptcy to\n3\nusing credit cards to overspend on his then minor stepchildren.4\nPost-bankruptcy, Applicant had additional financial problems in about\n2002\u20132003. A 2002 credit report reveals derogatory information about multiple\naccounts, although it notes several of the accounts were included in the 1997\nbankruptcy.  For example, it reports two collection accounts, each less than $100, as\n5\nwell as past-due accounts. Applicant addressed these matters in a 2003 sworn\nstatement,  which reflects that he paid in full five creditors that day, and that he disputed\n6\ntwo other debts. The more recent May 2008 and January 2009 credit reports have\nadditional derogatory information, which formed the basis of the SOR allegations.7\nOther than a company-issued credit card, Applicant has not used credit cards\nsince the 1997 bankruptcy, and it appears that none of the SOR allegations concern\ncredit card debt. Applicant presented documentary proof that he paid the 13 debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.p.  He is\n8\ndisputing the two debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.n for a total amount of $1,537.  Neither of these\n9\ndebts appears on the most recent July 2009 credit report, which is a three-in-one credit\n\n Exhibit G. \n10\n Tr. 33\u201334. \n11\n Exhibits H and K. \n12\n Exhibit G at 9. \n13\n Exhibit K. \n14\n Exhibits 5 and 6. \n15\n Tr. 70\u201372. \n16\n4\nreport obtained by Applicant.  The remaining debt in \u00b6 1.c is alleged as a charged-off\n10\naccount for $29,562. It is the largest debt in the SOR. It stems from a second mortgage\nApplicant obtained in 2005, when he and his wife bought a home using an 80/20\nmortgage loan, which resulted in loans of $112,000 and $28,000. \nApplicant became aware of his financial problems sometime in late 2007, when\nhis wife informed him that foreclosure was started on their home. She handled the\nfinancial matters, and she did not keep Applicant informed of the ongoing financial\nproblems, to include unpaid loans she made to family members for about $18,000 in\ntotal.  Applicant has since taken responsibility for the family\u2019s financial affairs. \n11\nAware of the foreclosure action, Applicant contacted the bank to determine what\ncould be done to remedy the situation. The result appears to be that the bank placed\nthe account in a loan modification program, although Applicant described it as\nrefinancing in his hearing testimony. The loan modification occurred in 2007 or 2008\n(Applicant was unable to produce the loan modification agreement), and it caused the\nprincipal balance to increase from $110,003 to $139,003, a difference of $28,997. This\nis nearly the amount of the original second mortgage loan of $28,000.  The July 2009\n12\ncredit report shows that $0 is past due on the account.  And the transaction history\n13\nshows regular monthly payments since at least January 2008, with a balance of\n$136,533 as of September 2009.14\nInitially, the two mortgage loans were made and held by the same bank. At some\ntime, it is unclear when, the second loan was purchased by the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c.\nAnd the debt in \u00b6 1.c is established by the government\u2019s 2008 and 2009 credit reports,15\nwhich report it as a charged-off account with a balance of $29,562. \nApplicant was unaware of the charged-off account until it was brought to his\nattention in about May 2008, during the background investigation.  He contacted the\n16\ncreditor and then made several monthly payments with a view toward making a lump-\nsum settlement in the future. But based on the payment history and the transaction\nhistory, it now appears the bank repurchased the second mortgage loan when they\n\n Exhibits H and K; see Applicant\u2019s testimony at Tr. 58\u201363 (now his belief that the current mortgage balance\n17\nincludes the money owed to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n Exhibit G at 5 (for purposes of appellate review, if necessary, I highlighted the relevant sections of the credit\n18\nreport in orange). \n Exhibit D. \n19\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n20\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n21\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n22\n5\nmodified the loan.  This would explain the increase to principal of $28,997, as noted\n17\nabove. This finding is also supported by Applicant\u2019s July 2009 credit report, because it\nshows a $0 balance and $0 past due for the creditor in \u00b6 1.c.   \n18\nApplicant\u2019s attributes his recent financial difficulties to his wife\u2019s mishandling of\ntheir finances and his inattention to the same. Also, Applicant points to the serious\nhealth problems of both him and his wife. She has had a hysterectomy, a stroke in 2000\nfollowed by seizures (the most serious of which took placed during 2000\u20132003), and\nshe reports nine surgeries in the last three years. Applicant had a heart attack in 2006,\nwhen  it was determined he had a 95% blockage in an artery. A stent was inserted, but\ntwo additional procedures were required to adjust and then replace the device. He was\nout of work for about six weeks due to the heart attack, but he used vacation time and\nsick leave to avoid unpaid time. The medical problems generated out-of-pocket\nexpenses. For example, from July 2008 to present, Applicant and his wife spent about\n$6,500 for out-of-pocket medical expenses.    \n19\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n20\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n21\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n22\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n23\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n24\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n27\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n28\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n29\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n30\n6\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n23\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n24\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n25\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n26\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n27\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.28\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.29\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n30\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n31\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n32\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n33\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n34\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n35\n7\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n31\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n32\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nBoth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions should be analyzed in light of the\nrecord as a whole. The record here shows Applicant has a history of financial difficulties\ndating back to the events that precipitated the 1997 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, reappeared\nduring 2002-2003, and came to a head again in 2007\u20132008, with the start of the home\nforeclosure. Taken together, these circumstances raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nTurning first to the disqualifying conditions under \u00b6 19 of Guideline F, Applicant\u2019s\nwell-established history of financial difficulties raises concerns because it indicates\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial\n33\nobligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to\n34\nestablish the two disqualifying conditions, and it suggests financial irresponsibility as\nwell.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six mitigating conditions as follows:  \n35\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n36\n8\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and none, either individually\nor in combination, are sufficient to mitigate and overcome the security concerns.\nApplicant receives credit in mitigation under \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e). But what\nis missing here is a track record of financial stability and responsibility buttressed by\nknowledge and understanding of his financial condition. In this regard, it was troubling\nthat Applicant was uncertain whether he refinanced his mortgage loans or entered into a\nloan modification agreement. And he obviously did not retain records of the transaction\nthat he could have produced for this proceeding. An applicant for a security clearance is\nnot required to have expertise in personal finance matters, but it is reasonable to expect\na 47-year-old military retiree, who is now employed in the defense industry, to give\nenough attention to his financial affairs so that he has a commonsense understanding of\nhis obligations. Based on the record as a whole, it is simply too soon to tell if he will\nconduct himself as a financially-responsible person. Looking forward, the likelihood of\nadditional financial problems cannot be ruled out.   \nAlso, I gave due consideration to the nine-factor whole-person concept.36\nApplicant is an experienced and mature individual who should be able to handle his\nfinancial obligations. He has good intentions and wants to improve his financial\ncondition. He has a good job, earns a decent salary, and enjoys the benefit of\nretirement pay earned by his military service. These circumstances weigh in his favor.\nBut the foreclosure action is substantial evidence of how unmanageable or out of\ncontrol his financial situation had become. Although the origins of his recent financial\n\n9\nproblems were likely unknown to him due to his spouse\u2019s actions in not keeping him\ninformed, it appears the problems were compounded by his insufficient attention to his\nfinancial responsibilities. Without a well-established track record of financial\nresponsibility\u2014which is lacking here\u2014the clearly-consistent standard and Egan require\nan unfavorable decision.   \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.p:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 28, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nclearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 18, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated January 7, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations \nand requested a decision without a hearing. On January 26, 2009, pursuant to section \nE3.1.7 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, Department Counsel requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared \nto proceed on January 23, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on January 26, \n2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on January 28, 2009, and I convened the \nhearing, as scheduled, on February 9, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, nine Government exhibits and one Applicant exhibit were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on February 13, 2009. \n \nThe record was kept open until February 18, 2009, to enable Applicant to \nsupplement the record.  Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and, on February \n16, 2009, he submitted one additional document (marked as Applicant Exhibit B) which \nwas admitted without objection.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.e. of \nthe SOR.  He denied the remaining allegations. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain a TOP SECRET security clearance which was previously granted to him in 2003.1 \nHe served honorably on active duty with the U.S. Navy from July 1986 until March \n1994.2 He has been employed by the same defense contractor since October 1999, and \ncurrently serves as a senior technician.3 \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated November 28, 2007), at 22.  \n \n2 Id. at 17. \n \n3 Id. at 9-10. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant was married in 1990, and has one child, who is 16 years of age.4  \n \nIn 1992, with $10,544 of total liabilities, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection \nunder Chapter 13.5 In August 1995, all payments under the bankruptcy plan having \nbeen completed, a discharge was granted.6  \n \n In May 2005, Applicant supposedly voluntarily co-signed for a friend\u2019s $130,000 \nhome equity line of credit.7 The scheme was for Applicant to purchase the house in his \nname and, in exchange for $10,000, to give his friend a quitclaim so he could refinance \nit.8 The friend apparently did not make his required monthly payments on the loan and \nthe unpaid balance quickly increased. Applicant was never informed, either by the friend \nor the mortgage lender, that the payments were delinquent.9 Furthermore, since he did \nnot reside in the house, he had no interest in the loan status.10 The account was \nsubsequently turned over for collection, and the $140,000 balance was eventually \ncharged off to profit and loss.11  Applicant attempted to have his name removed from \nthe loan, without success.12 He acknowledges that, under the law, he is legally \nresponsible for the debt, but he has no intention of paying it.13 Furthermore, he has \nmade no effort to go after the beneficiary of the loan because they are \u201cfriends,\u201d14 and \nthe friend is unemployed.15 His only present interest in the issue is to dispute and have \nthe negative loan report deleted from his credit report because the house was lost to \nforeclosure and he has no means to pay the balance.16 \n \n \n4 Tr. at 35. \n \n5 Government Exhibit 2 (Voluntary Petition, filed June 24, 1992). \n \n6 Id.

While there are a number of mortgage lenders referred to therein, \nreflecting several years of mortgages made, paid, closed, delinquent, charged off, and \ntransferred, the particular lending institution is reflected as well. There is a 1st mortgage \nin the amount of $616,000, made in December 2004, which was subsequently \ntransferred to another unspecified lender because of over 120 days delinquency.28 \nThere is also a home equity line of credit or 2nd mortgage in the amount of $93,000, \nmade in May 2005, which was subsequently sent to collection for being delinquent, and \neventually charged off to profit and loss.29 Applicant contends the 2nd mortgage has a \n \n17 Government Exhibit 4 (LexisNexis\u00ae Judgment and Lien Filings (based on Social Security Number), dated \nJanuary 1, 2006).. \n \n18 Tr. at 74, 85. \n \n19 Applicant Exhibit B (Release of Tax Lien, dated February 12, 2009). \n \n20 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 7, at 12; Id. at 44, 81.  It should be noted that the credit report indicates \nthis mortgage too was not a joint mortgage, but rather an individual one. \n \n21 Government Exhibit 9, supra note 11, at 3. \n \n22 Tr. at 44-45. \n \n23 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 9. \n \n24 Tr. at 46, 48, 64. \n \n25 Id. at 64. \n \n26 Id. at 46. \n \n27 Id. at 47-48, 64, 72. \n \n28 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 7, at 11; Government Exhibit 9, supra note 8, at 3. \n \n29 Id.

Government Exhibit 9, at 2. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nzero balance and that the debt has been satisfied.30 In part, he is accurate. There is a \nzero balance, not because he paid the balance, but because the account was charged \noff to profit and loss. \n \nApplicant estimates his monthly mortgage payments on his residence to be \n$2,200 on the 1st mortgage and $400 or $415 on the 2nd mortgage.31 He and his wife \nearn a monthly net salary of about $5,800, with about $5,000 in expenses.32 With the \nexception of the purported mortgage deficiencies on the mortgages for his friends\u2019 \nhomes, all their other accounts and expenses are now current.33 As already noted, he \nsteadfastly denies either of the mortgages on his personal residence is delinquent.34 \n \nOn November 28, 2007, when Applicant completed the e-QIP, there were two \nquestions of particular significance pertaining to financial matters. Section 28, question \na. asked: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  \nSection 28, question b. asked: \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d  He responded \u201cno\u201d to both questions,35 and certified that his responses were \ntrue, complete, and accurate.36 They were not. He continued to deny any such \ndelinquencies.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \n \n30 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated January 7, 2009. \n \n31 Tr. at 53-54. \n \n32 Id. at 57-58. \n \n33 Id. at 59-60. \n \n34 Id. at 47-48, 64, 72. \n \n35 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 23. \n \n36 Id. at 1. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d37 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n \n37 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nLikewise, under AG & 19(b), \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible \nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt,\u201d may also be potentially disqualifying. Similarly, \nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns as well. The evidence is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c). \n \nIn 2005, Applicant chose to either co-sign for or individually apply for mortgage \nloans on houses for two friends, although he later acknowledged he did not know one of \nthose \u201cfriends\u201d very well.  In fact, what he characterized as merely helping friends, was \nseemingly much more than that, for he admitted the existence of a financial scheme to \ninitially take out the mortgage for at least one of his friends with an anticipated quitclaim \ndeed to be issued for a $10,000 payment. Considering the circumstances of the loans, \nhis actions, if not actually frivolous, were definitely irresponsible. Both friends failed to \nmake their monthly mortgage payments.  One mortgage delinquency was charged off to \nprofit and loss and the other one is simply very delinquent. Both homes are now vacant. \nSince he did not reside in either house, he had no interest in the loan status. He \nacknowledges that, under the law, he is legally responsible for the debt, but has no \nintention of paying either mortgage, and has made no effort to go after the beneficiaries \nof either loan because he is a \u201cfriend\u201d of one who is unemployed, and he does not know \nwhere the other one resides. His only present interest in the issue is to dispute them \nand have the negative loan reports deleted from his credit report.  Also, he claims he \ndoes not have sufficient money to pay off the loans. \n \nWhile neither of the two houses has gone to foreclosure, such actions are \napparently on hold and have not yet taken place. This situation presents an interesting \nconundrum, for if the foreclosures do occur, under state law, Applicant may not be liable \nfor either the unpaid mortgages or the deficiencies, and the lien holders would be limited \nto the property. Under California law, there is a provision called the Anti-Deficiency \nStatute,38 which states in relevant part: \n \nNo deficiency judgment shall lie in any event after a sale of real property \nor an estate for years therein for failure of the purchaser to complete his or \nher contract of sale, or under a deed of trust or mortgage given to the \nvendor to secure payment of the balance of the purchase price of that real \nproperty or estate for years therein, or under a deed of trust or mortgage \non  a dwelling for not more than four families given to a lender to secure \nrepayment of a loan which was in fact used to pay all or part of the \n \n38 Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 580(b). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \npurchase price of that dwelling occupied, entirely or in part, by the \npurchaser. \n \nUnder this section, generally if there is a foreclosure on a dwelling and there is a \ndeficiency, the lender has no recourse regarding \u201cpurchase money loans,\u201d also called \n\u201cnon-recourse loans,\u201d the amounts set forth in both the 1st and the 2nd mortgages used \nto finance the dwelling purchase. The collateral or dwelling is considered full \nsatisfaction. However, there is a caveat, for the protection is afforded only if the \nborrower actually dwells in the property, a fact which has not been met for either house \nin this instance. In addition, there is another pertinent law, called the One Form of \nAction Rule,39 which states in relevant part: \n \nThere can be but one form of action for the recovery of any debt, or the \nperformance of any right secured by mortgage upon real property.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nWhen \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., the loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d is also potentially mitigating under AG & 20(b). \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is \npotentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@40 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply.  Except for SOR allegation 1.e., the evidence \nis insufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), or 20(e).  As to that allegation, the \nevidence is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).   \n \n39 Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 726(a). \n40 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 15:    \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under \nAG & 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  The evidence is sufficient to establish AG & \n16(a), for Applicant either knew, or should have reasonably known, the actual facts of \nthe delinquencies, when he completed the e-QIP questions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct, but none of them apply here. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant chose to either co-sign for \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nor individually apply for mortgage loans on houses for two friends, although he later \nacknowledged he did not know one of those \u201cfriends\u201d very well.  He subsequently \nadmitted the existence of a financial scheme. Considering the circumstances of the \nloans, his actions, if not actually frivolous, were definitely irresponsible. Since he did not \nreside in either house, he possessed no interest in the status of either loan, despite \nknowing he is legally responsible for the debts. Furthermore, he has no intention of \npaying either mortgage, and he has made no effort to go after the beneficiaries of either \nloan. His only present interest in the issue is to dispute them and have the negative loan \nreports deleted from his credit report. (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), 2(a)(5), and 2(a)(7).)  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether Applicant\u2019s mortgage debts are \nresolved; it is whether his financial circumstances and personal conduct raise concerns \nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one factor, \nconsidered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s actions in a sympathetic light, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.41 Considering the circumstances \nbehind the mortgage loans for his friends, his total disinterest in the status of those \nloans, the lack of any effort to resolve the loans either with his friends or the mortgage \nlenders, his declared intention not to pay the loans, and his lack of candor in the e-QIP, \nhis actions are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. (See AG && 2(a)(6) and \n2(a)(9).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n41 See U.S. v.

On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security\nconcerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nIn a response notarized on December 29, 2008, Applicant admitted the eight\nallegations set forth in the SOR and declined a hearing on the record. Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), dated February 19, 2009, that\nincluded 12 attached items. Applicant received the FORM on February 25, 2009. He did\nnot respond to the FORM within the 30 days provided. On July 7, 2009, the Director,\nJuly 27, 2009\n\n Item 2, Response to SOR at 3.\n      1\n Id.\n      2\n Id.\n      3\n Id.\n      4\n2\nDOHA, forwarded the case for assignment to an administrative judge for administrative\ndetermination. I was assigned the case on July 9, 2009. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding\nthe security concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old systems administrator working for a defense\ncontractor. He has worked for the same company for more than seven years. Prior to\nthat, he served in the military for approximately 30 years. Applicant has earned a high\nschool diploma and a bachelor of science degree in information technology. He has\nbeen married for nearly 20 years. In responding to the SOR, Applicant submitted scant\nfacts with little elaboration and no supporting evidence. \nAt some unspecified point in time, Applicant\u2019s wife developed a gambling\ncompulsion. Spending \u201cthousands of dollars per month at the casino,\u201d her gambling\ncompromised Applicant\u2019s financial stability.  He told her he thought she had a problem\n1\nand asked her to quit gambling, but she continued. He eventually had her name\nremoved from the family bank account. This \u201chelped a little, but the damage was\nalready done and a snowballing affect [sic] occurred.\u201d  He struggled to stay current on\n2\ntheir mounting debt while he tried to pay her creditors. Consequently, many of his\nobligations became delinquent and, ultimately, he lost his home to foreclosure in July\n2008. \nForced to vacate their home in the middle of 2008, Applicant expended\napproximately $6,000 in expenses moving out of the home and about $3,000 moving\ninto a rental property. To finance this move and meet his obligations, Applicant\nliquidated his 401(k) retirement account and obtained a $3,000 advance from his\nemployer. Around this same time, Applicant\u2019s automobile \u201cfailed,\u201d causing him to make\na $2,600 down payment on a replacement vehicle.  Next, his wife\u2019s car lease expired.\n3\nDue to their low credit rating, he was required to refinance her car at a high rate. \nBy the end of August 2008, Applicant believed the worst was over and that his\nfinances were nearly stabilized. In September 2008, however, his employer began\ncollecting $1,000 per month to repay its $3,000 advance. This dramatic reduction in net\nsalary made it \u201cliterally impossible\u201d for him to pay his bills.  \n4\nApplicant states, without evidence, that he tried to negotiate settlements with\nsome of his creditors. Some of the creditors refused to negotiate or demanded\n\n Id.\n      5\n Id.\n      6\n3\npayments he could not afford. He also asserts that some of the negotiated payments\nwere set for automatic payment from Applicant\u2019s bank account, but at a fee of $35 per\ntransaction plus $5 a day \u201cfor continuous negativity in the account.\u201d  He claims such\n5\nbank fees added an additional financial burden of over $600 a month. \nAt issue are six delinquent debts amounting to approximately $147,400. This\nincludes approximately $134,000 owed toward his foreclosure and about $12,000 owed\non a car loan. Additionally, Applicant admits he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection\ntwice, in March 23, 1998, and in September 26, 1988. Both petitions were ultimately\ndischarged shortly after filing. In describing his present status in relation to his current\ndebts, Applicant writes: \u201cI am not sure what to do at this point, but this is the reasons\n[sic] for my indebtedness, except I am trying to continue negotiations with creditors.\u201d   \n6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nAn administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number\nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe U. S. Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      7\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      9\n Id.\n      10\n Id.\n      11\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      12\n4\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n7\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n8\n9\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the U.S. Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The U.S.\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such information.  The\n11\ndecision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of an applicant.  Nor does it reflect badly on that person\u2019s character. It is\n12\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      13\n W hile FC DC AG \u00b6 19(i) refers to gambling debts, it refers to debts incurred by an applicant.\n      14\n5\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.13\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nApplicant admits to having successfully petitioned for bankruptcy in 1988 and in\n1998. He also admits he is \u201cnot sure what to do\u201d about the approximately $147,400 in\ndelinquent debt he presently owes. Such facts are sufficient to give rise to financial\nconsiderations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).14\nWith such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case\nagainst him and mitigate security concerns. \nThere are insufficient facts to determine what led Applicant to file for bankruptcy\nin both 1988 and 1998. He attributes his 2008 financial problems, however, to his wife\u2019s\ngambling and his efforts to pay her debts. As a consequence, his home was foreclosed\nupon and other accounts were neglected. His automobile\u2019s failure subsequently\nrequired him to seek a replacement car. In response to these obstacles, he removed\nhis wife from their bank account, took a loan from his employer, liquidated his\nretirement savings, and tried to negotiate with his creditors. To the extent these factors\ncontributed to his present situation, financial considerations mitigating condition (FC\nMC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d) applies. \nThe majority of debts at issue became delinquent within the last two years.\nApplicant\u2019s 2008 finances present him with a financial dilemma it may be presumed he\npreviously faced in 1988 and in 1999. While he links his current predicament with his\nwife\u2019s gambling and writes she is no longer on the family bank account, he presents no\nevidence indicating her problem is under control or that she is otherwise precluded from\nacquiring more family debt. Moreover, he has no plan to address his current financial\nsituation. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) does not\napply. Further, there are no facts indicating he sought or received financial counseling\nor that any significant progress has been made to pay off this debt, obviating\napplication of FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control\u201d) and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d). No other FC MCs apply.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature, educated man who rendered service to this country for\nthe majority of his life. In requesting an administrative determination, however, he chose\nto present unelaborated facts and no supporting documentation. What documentation\nthere is indicates a repeated pattern of financial instability about every 10 years, in\n1988, 1998, and 2008. Assuming his wife\u2019s gambling was the cause of his current\nsituation, there is a basis for mitigating their acquisition of delinquent debt related to her\nproblem. There is, however, no evidence he has made any progress on the debts at\nissue and no indication he has devised a viable plan to address this debt by means\nother than repeated negotiations. Indeed, Applicant concedes he has no idea as to how\nto proceed at this point. Consequently, the accounts at issue remain delinquent. In light\nof the fact that the ultimate burden is on Applicant, financial considerations security\nconcerns remain unmitigated. Therefore, it is not clearly consistent with national\nsecurity to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 12, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on January 7, 2008 (Item 4).  On December 3, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E concerning the Applicant.  The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on December 22, 2008, and\nrequested a decision without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on January 13, 2009.  The Applicant\nreceived the FORM on January 27, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any\nadditional information.  He elected not to submit anything further.  The case was\n\n2\nassigned to me on March 24, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nand exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 58 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admitted all of the allegations\nunder this paragraph.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  \nThe Applicant submits that, \u201cAll these debts happened after 10/11 2001 and I\nwas Laid off from my job.\u201d  (Item 3 at 1.)  He further states, \u201cI did my best this year\n(2008) to solve every one of these debts to make arrangements, but it was almost\nimpossible, but I promise that this coming year (2009) I will solve these debts.\u201d  (Item 3\nat 1.)\n1.a.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to his State taxing authority in the\napproximate amount of $263.00.  (Item 7.)  This debt has not been paid.\n1.b.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a bank for an account that has\nbeen charged off in the amount of $2,101.00.  This debt has not been paid.\n1.c.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to the same bank for another\naccount that has been charged off in the amount of $1,575.00.  This debt has not been\npaid.\n1.d.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to the same bank for a third\naccount that has been charged off in the amount of $2,387.00.  This debt has not been\npaid.\n1.e.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to the same bank for a fourth\naccount that has been charged off in the amount of $2,243.00.  This debt has not been\npaid.\n1.f.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a second bank for an account\nthat has been charged off in the amount of $2,895.00.  This debt has not been paid.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in conduct which shows questionable judgment,\n\n3\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The\nApplicant admits both allegations under this paragraph.  Those admissions are deemed\nfindings of fact.\n2.a.  Question 28.a. of Item 4 asks the Applicant whether, within the last seven\nyears, he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts.  He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d\nand did not set forth any of the delinquent debts described under Paragraph 1, above.\nThis answer was, therefore, false. \n2.b.  Question 28.b. of Item 4 asks the Applicant whether he was currently more\nthan 90 days delinquent on any of his debts.  He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and did not state any\nof the delinquent debts described under Paragraph 1, above.  This answer was,\ntherefore, false.\nThe Applicant submitted a written response in his \u201cAnswers of Statement of\nReasons\u201d (Item 3).  That response states, \u201cThe explanation to these two answers are\nboth the same.  I answered to the best of my knowledge as a \u2018NO\u2019 and now I realized\nthe big mistake I did, I should say \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has over $11,464.00 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily after 2001, when he was laid off.  However, the fact\nthat he has done nothing to pay these debts, and that they have been due and owing for\nso long, is still troubling.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  The Applicant argues that many of these debts\ncame from unemployment or underemployment.  However, there is there is no evidence\nthat he has acted responsibly.  He states that he was unable to resolve these debts in\n2008, but will do so in 2009.  A statement that he intends to resolve the indebtedness in\nthe future is not sufficient evidence that he can or will resolve the debts.  I cannot find,\nunder these particular facts, that the Applicant has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\nAG \u00b6 20(c) states that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthere are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s credit reports show\nthat, in the main, he is making sufficient payments on his current indebtedness.\nHowever, as stated above, he has indicated nothing but a desire to resolve his past due\nindebtedness.  This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nBased on all of the available evidence, I cannot find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the allegations under this Guideline.  Paragraph 1 is found against the\nApplicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) states that it may be disqualifying where an Applicant engages in the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\n\n6\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  \nThe Applicant\u2019s e-QIP contains false and misleading answers about his financial\nsituation.  The Applicant\u2019s statement in his Answer, quoted above, does not sufficiently\nlessen the security significance of these false answers.  None of the mitigating\nconditions apply.  Based on all of the information set forth above, Paragraph 2 is found\nagainst the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has a history of not\npaying his debts, and falsified a Government questionnaire concerning those debts.  As\nset forth above, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  In addition, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), or that the likelihood of recurrence is\nclose to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconditions and his personal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1999 to 2005. He deployed to Iraq for about 14 months in 2004 and 2005. He received a General Under Honorable Conditions Discharge in 2005. He attended college, but did not obtain a degree. He was married from 2001 until his divorce in 2002. He married again in 2004, but is separated. He has two children, ages nine and one, and a seven- year-old stepchild. Appellant has custody of his two children. He also had a six-year-old child, but he and the mother relinquished their parental rights and the child was adopted by a member of the mother\u2019s family.1 The SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing all the debts, with the exception of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i, which he denied. The 14 debts that Applicant admitted he owed total $22,475. Applicant had some financial issues while he was in the Army, but he attributed most of his problems to unemployment, under-employment, and the failure of his business after he was discharged from the Army. Applicant was discharged from the Army after he smoked marijuana and tested positive on a drug screening test.2 A state tax lien of $1,234 was filed against Applicant in August 2007, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.

Applicant submitted an additional four pages of documents, which were marked \nAE L through O, and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s second \nmemorandum is marked HE II. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nApril 17, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since April 2008. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from \n1999 to 2005. He deployed to Iraq for about 14 months in 2004 and 2005. He received \na General Under Honorable Conditions Discharge in 2005. He attended college, but did \nnot obtain a degree. He was married from 2001 until his divorce in 2002. He married \nagain in 2004, but is separated. He has two children, ages nine and one, and a seven-\nyear-old stepchild. Appellant has custody of his two children. He also had a six-year-old \nchild, but he and the mother relinquished their parental rights and the child was adopted \nby a member of the mother\u2019s family.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted owing all the debts, with the exception of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, \n1.h, and 1.i, which he denied. The 14 debts that Applicant admitted he owed total \n$22,475.  \n \n \nApplicant had some financial issues while he was in the Army, but he attributed \nmost of his problems to unemployment, under-employment, and the failure of his \nbusiness after he was discharged from the Army. Applicant was discharged from the \nArmy after he smoked marijuana and tested positive on a drug screening test.2   \n \n \nA state tax lien of $1,234 was filed against Applicant in August 2007, as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. He admitted he owed the money. He stated it resulted from when he was \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 21, 42-43, 73-76; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-22, 46; GE 1. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was not alleged as an allegation in the SOR \nand will not be used for disqualification purposes. It will be considered for the impact it had on his \nfinances and in the application of mitigating conditions. Because Applicant listed the drug use on his \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions, it will also be considered as circumstantial evidence on \nwhether he intentionally falsified the Questionnaire by omitting financial information.  \n\n \n3 \n \nself-employed and he went out of business because of lack of customers. He has not \nmade any payments on this debt.3 \n \n \nApplicant paid the following debts: SOR \u00b6 1.b, a $345 debt to a collection \ncompany on behalf of a telephone services provider, was paid on April 16, 2009. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, two debts totaling $209 to a collection company on behalf of a \ndepartment store, were paid on May 7, 2009. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, Applicant paid $512 \non April 16, 2009 to a collection company on behalf of a telecommunications company. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p, a $229 debt to a video store was paid on April 16, 2009. Applicant disputed \nowing the $54 debt for a returned check to a supermarket chain, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. He stated that he has not lived in the geographic area where the chain is located, \nbut his ex-wife lived in that area. He thought she could have taken one of his checks \nwithout his knowledge. He paid the debt anyway on May 7, 2009.4    \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the delinquent debt of $1,103 to a collection company \non behalf of a cable television provider, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was for a cable box that was not returned when he moved. He stated his wife \npacked the box and it was placed in storage. After the hearing, Applicant submitted a \nreceipt from the cable company dated April 16, 2009, showing that the issued \nequipment was returned and he had a zero balance.5   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k allege delinquent child support debts of $9,620 and $2,765. \nApplicant admitted that he was delinquent on the child support he owed for the six-year-\nold child that he eventually gave up for adoption. He stated that paternity was not \ndetermined until the child was about two years old, and then he was ordered to pay the \narrears on the support owed since the child was born. He also indicated that he fell \nbehind on the payments after he was discharged from the Army. His pay was garnished \nto pay the child support. His child support obligations ended when he relinquished his \nparental rights through adoption. His pay continues to be garnished about $40 every \ntwo weeks to pay the arrears. He stated that his income tax refunds have also been \nseized to pay the arrears. He stated that the amount of the arrears is now about $9,000. \nHe did not submit any documentation to show the actual arrears.6 \n \n \nApplicant denied that he owed $1,369 on a delinquent military exchange credit \ncard account, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He admitted he had an exchange credit card, \nbut thought he paid the debt. He thought his income tax refund may have been seized \nto pay the debt. He also denied owing the delinquent debt of $2,817 to Defense Finance \nand Accounting Service (DFAS), as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Both debts are listed on the \ncredit reports of June 28, 2008 and December 1, 2008. The DFAS debt is listed as a \n\u201cGovernment Overpayment.\u201d Applicant stated that he did not remember ever being \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 46-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n4 Tr. at 56-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE B-D, G, H, J, K, M-O. \n \n5 Tr. at 47-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE I. \n \n6 Tr. at 23-30, 72-73; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE E. \n \n\n \n4 \n \noverpaid by the Government. He did not submit any documentation about the debts. He \nstated that he had difficulty in contacting the correct individuals at the exchange and at \nDFAS. He works on a military installation, but he indicated that he was told by the \npersonnel on the installation that they could not assist him because he was not in the \nmilitary.7  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the remaining five delinquent debts which total $6,624 \nand are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.q, and 1.r. No payments have been made on \nany of these debts, but he stated that he intends to pay all his delinquent debts. He is \nfocused on not accruing new delinquent debts and paying the ones he has one-by-one. \nHe attempted to obtain a debt consolidation loan but he was told that his debts were not \nhigh enough to qualify for a loan. He has not received formal financial counseling, but \nhis supervisor has assisted him in formulating a budget.8   \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), \nwhich he certified as true on May 30, 2008. He listed his marijuana use under the \npertinent question. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 27c, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other \ndebt(s)?\u201d He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 28a and 28b, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 \nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \u201cAre you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant stated that he did not understand \nthe questions.9 After considering all the evidence, Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and his \ncommunication skills, I find that he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from his supervisor. The supervisor wrote that \nApplicant is a valued employee who is professional, exceptionally reliable, and \nmaintains a high level of integrity. He places Applicant in a supervisory position when he \nis absent. Applicant is held in high regard at all levels of their organization.10  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 50-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 23, 47-50, 70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE I. \n \n9 Tr. at 21-23, 69-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n10 AE A. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n6 \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes the largest debts alleged in the SOR. His financial issues are \nongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. He attributes his financial problems to \nunemployment, under-employment, and the failure of his business after he was \ndischarged from the Army. However, several of the debts were accrued before he was \ndischarged. He was discharged because he smoked marijuana and was caught on a \ndrug screening test. His discharge was not an event that was beyond his control. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was not responsible conduct. He did not begin to act \n\n \n7 \n \nresponsibly toward his delinquent debts until recently. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nAlmost all the payments on his delinquent debts have been made within the last 40 \ndays. Those payments constitute a good start on paying his debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) is \napplicable as a good-faith effort to repay those creditors. The payments are insufficient \nto qualify as a good-faith effort to repay all his overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \napplicable to his other debts. He has not received formal financial counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is headed in the right direction, but there are not yet clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant denied owing four debts. He paid two of the debts, so they are no \nlonger a concern. He denied owing DFAS and the military exchange. He did not submit \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute. His testimony on the debts is \nnot persuasive. AG \u00b6 20(e) provides minimal mitigation for those two debts.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following mitigating condition is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant omitted some financial information from his Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions; however, as discussed above, it was not a deliberate omission. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c are concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n8 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered the positive aspects of Applicant\u2019s military service, including his service in \nIraq. Some of his financial problems can be traced to unemployment, under-\nemployment, and the failure of his business after he was discharged from the Army. \nHowever, those problems were of his own making. He is highly regarded by his \nemployer and he has begun to behave responsibly by addressing his delinquent debts. \nHowever, he still has a large amount of delinquent debts. His payments are a good \nstart, but are insufficient at this time to mitigate security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Personal Conduct security concerns, but has not mitigated \nthe concerns raised under the Financial Considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.r: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 22, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the pertinent mitigating conditions; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous;\nand whether the Judge denied Applicant due process of law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a system administrator\nfor a defense contractor.  He has received a two-year degree from a technical institute.  In the early\n2000s, he had substantial debt, resulting from student loans and from credit card use.  Applicant filed\nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and was discharged in bankruptcy in September 2004.  \nIn August 2004, Applicant engaged in an \u201coral partnership\u201d with another person for the\npurchase of residential property.  Decision at 2.  The partner would take care of repairs and cover\nthe monthly loan payments, while Applicant would secure financing.  Applicant paid nothing down\nfor the property, the purchase of which was covered by two separate loans\u2013one, a second mortgage,\nin the amount of $55,000 and the other, a conventional first mortgage, in the amount of\n$220,000\u2013from the same lender.  The Judge observed, \u201cJust how Applicant was able to finance the\npurchase of his investment property for nothing down and little track history, and during a pending\nbankruptcy, is unclear.\u201d  Id. at 3.  Applicant\u2019s partner ceased making payments on the investment\nproperty, and, from November 2004 until October 2006, neither Applicant nor his partner made any\npayments.  \nIn 2005, the lender sold the two loans to two separate entities.  The holder of the $55,000\nnote charged it off, while the holder of the other sought to sell the property off at a public auction.\nApparently unsuccessful in finding a buyer at the foreclosure sale, the holder of the $220,000 note,\naccording to Applicant, \u201ceither retained title . . . or resold it to a third party.\u201d  Id. at 4.   The Judge\ncommented that the record evidence is not sufficient to resolve the question of who owns this\nproperty.  Applicant has been working with a credit building firm to resolve his disputes with the\ncreditors in question.  He nets over $1,100 a month after he pays his expenses.  \nApplicant contends that he was denied due process of law, insofar as he acted pro se.  He\ncontends that the Judge should have sua sponte held the record open for him to provide additional\nevidence, for example, documentation concerning the loan in question.  He implies that, had he been\nrepresented by an attorney at the hearing, he would have requested an opportunity to present\nadditional documents, which could have answered questions lingering after the close of the record.\nAn examination of the record demonstrates that Applicant was notified of the rights afforded him\nby the Directive, including his right to employ counsel, both prior to the hearing and at the beginning\n\n\u201cHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities, among which is the\n1\nexpectancy of consistent trust and candor.

However, the record demonstrates that it was Applicant himself who introduced the question of his debts\u2019\nenforceability.  In response to a question about a possible deficiency judgement against him, Applicant replied that\nlenders generally do not pursue such avenues of recovery.  Tr. at 89.  The Judge\u2019s comments about the absence of\ncorroboration for Applicant\u2019s opinion are reasonable, in light of the fact that Applicant bore the burden of persuasion\nas to mitigation.

Applicant has some post-high school education and appears from the transcript to be articulate\nand able to understand the allegations against him.  The record provides no reason to doubt that\nApplicant\u2019s decision to represent himself was knowing and intelligent.  Having chosen to represent\nhimself, Applicant cannot complain about the quality of his self-representation.  See  ISCR Case No.\n08-03110 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009); ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).\nFurthermore, Applicant has not demonstrated that any documents that he, with the advantage of\nhindsight, might have submitted at the hearing would likely have produced a different result.  \nIn the analysis portion of his decision, the Judge stated that the evidence was not sufficient\nto resolve the issue of whether state law would operate to Applicant\u2019s benefit by relieving him of\nliability for a possible deficiency judgement.  He also noted that Applicant had not provided\nperformance evaluations from his job, letters of support from supervisors, etc.  However, the Judge\u2019s\ndecision relied in large measure upon Applicant\u2019s having entered into a facially risky real estate\npurchase while undergoing bankruptcy, thereby evidencing a lack of trustworthiness and reliability.1\nDespite the Judge\u2019s comments about various types of documentation which could have been\nsubmitted, there is little reason to believe that such evidence would have supported the grant of a\nclearance under the facts of this case.   Reliance upon the extent to which a debt may be legally\n2\nunenforceable is generally not sufficient to demonstrate a reasonable response to debts or a good\nfaith effort to pay them.   While a Judge has the authority to hold a record open for the submission\n3\nof other evidence, he has no positive obligation to do so, especially when, as here, Applicant does\nnot request it.    \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The case was scheduled for hearing\non May 19, 2009.  A hearing was held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and five\nJune 22, 2009\n\n2\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received May 31, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated two related\ndebts (one charged off and the other associated with a mortgage foreclosure)\nexceeding $110,000.00 and (b) filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2004 and\nreceived a discharge in September 2004.  \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the alleged debt covered by\nsubparagraph 1.a and admitted the subparagraph 1.b debt and Chapter 7 bankruptcy\npetition and discharge covered by subparagraph 1.c.  Applicant claimed he did not owe\nmonies to creditor 1.a and disputes the debt covered by creditor 1.b.  He claimed his\nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge afforded him a fresh start and chance to improve his\nfinancial situation.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year-old system administrator for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is unmarried and has no children (see ex. 1).  Aided by student loans,\nhe earned a two-degree in information technology from a technical institute in June\n2002 (ex. 1; R.T., at 136-137).  He has since earned some additional college credits\nand plans to return to school next semester (ex. 1; R.T., at 101-102).  His company\nassists him financially with his schooling (R.T., at 102).\nConcerned about his mounting credit card and student loan debts, Applicant\npetitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in June 2004 (see exs.1 and 3; R.T., at ).\nHe scheduled $30,000.00 to $40,0000.00 in credit card debts and student loans that he\nstill is paying on (R.T., at 76).  The bankruptcy discharge he received in September\n2004 did not wipe out all of his credit card debts or his student loan debts (R.T., at 76-\n78).  \nIn August 2004, a friend recommended an investment property to Applicant  and\nreferred him to another individual to complete the investment (R.T., at 41, 80-81).\nApplicant formed an oral partnership with this referred friend, with the understanding\nhis new partner would take care of needed repairs and cover the monthly loan\npayments, and Applicant would obtain the financing for the purchase (R.T., at 41-43,\n49).  Applicant, in turn, applied for financing of a residential property (priced at\n$270,000.00) in the current state of his residence for a 100 per cent interest in the\nproperty (R.T., at 43, 81-82).  He paid nothing down on the financing he obtained for his\n\n3\npurchase (R.T., at 48). The lender broke the loan into separate loans (one for\n$55,000.00 to facilitate his buying the property) and the other a conventional first\nmortgage for around $220,000.00 (R.T., at 64-65, 83).  Both of these loans were\ncompleted with the same lender (R.T., at 53-55, 83-84).  Just how Applicant was able to\nfinance the purchase of his investment property for nothing down and little track history,\nand during a pending bankruptcy, is unclear.  Without any of the closing paperwork to\ncross-check for helpful clues, definitive answers cannot be gleaned from the record. \nRecords reflect that In August 2005, the original lender sold its second mortgage\n(most likely a purchase money mortgage) to creditor 1.a (see exs. 2, 3 and A; R.T., at\n66, 109-110). The following month the same lender sold its first mortgage to creditor 1.b\n(see exs. 2 and 3). \nApplicant purchased his investment property with the intention of making repairs\nand reselling the unit for a profit of around $2,500.00 (R.T., at 49, 80).  Although just 23\nyears of age and with no real estate training, he never discussed the purchase with his\nparents, never visited the property, and never anticipated having to repay the\n$270,000.00 purchase price (R.T., at 48-50, 80-81).  \nAfter singularly completing the purchase of the investment property, Applicant\ndeferred to his new partner who committed to making the required $1,500.00 monthly\npayments under the terms of his mortgage (R.T., at 49).  This putative partner made two\nor three payments towards both mortgages on the property, and then quit making\nmonthly payments altogether (R.T., at 49-50, 82).   Because Applicant did not try to rent\nthe property while it was in a past due status, it generated no income (R.T., at 106).\nIncoming rents could have been applied (in part) towards the mortgage, or upkeep of\nthe property, even if rents could not fully cover the mortgage given the state of the\nproperty at the time (R.T., at 106, 111-114).  \nRecords reflect that the lender resold its two loans in 2005 to two separate\nentities.  It sold its $55,000.00 second mortgage in August 2005 to creditor 1.a (see exs.\n3, 4 and A).  The same lender then sold its $220,000.00 conventional first mortgage the\nfollowing month to creditor 1.b (exs. 3, 4 and A).  \nWhen Applicant\u2019s partner ceased making payments on Applicant\u2019s investment\nproperty, Applicant tried to contact the partner, but without any success (R.T., at 51-52).\nFrom November 2004 through October 2006, neither Applicant nor his partner made\nany payments on the investment property.  During this period, Applicant received\nregular collection notices on his two loans (R.T., at 84-85).  He also made several\nattempts to contact creditor 1.a and perfect a short sale, but without success (R.T., at\n55-56, 86-87).  Sometime in 2006, creditor 1.a charged off its second mortgage account\n(R.T., at 86).  Applicant could not account for what the charge off meant (R.T., at 86).  \nIn November 2006, the first mortgagee mailed a foreclosure notice to Applicant,\nand proceeded to try to sell the property at public auction in February 2007 (R.T., at 54-\n56).  Apparently unsuccessful in finding a buyer at the foreclosure sale, creditor 1.b\n\n4\nredeemed the property, assumed ownership, and, according to Applicant, either\nretained title to the property, or resold it to a third party (R.T., at 59-60, 68-71, 88-89).\nWhile Applicant can not document creditor 1.b\u2019s ownership interest in the property (R.T.,\nat 69-70), he expresses confidence the creditor will not seek any money from him (R.T.,\nat 89).  He assures he checked the county records and identified a third party as the\nowner of the property (R.T., at 71).  Whether this party, Applicant, or creditor 1.b is the\nactual owner of the property is unclear.  His credit reports (exs. 3 and 4) reflect creditor\n1.b as the mortgagee of the property, not the owner. \nOwnership of the investment property Applicant purchased in 2004 remains a\ntroublesome issue, that cannot be reliably resolved without the aid of a title report or\nsome clear documentation from the lender or official records from the county recorder\nwhere the property is located.  Creditor 1.a, in the meantime, has charged off its\n$55,000.00 second mortgage purchase for reasons unclear (see exs B and E).  When\nApplicant contacted creditor 1.b to ascertain any collection intentions, he was\ntelephonically informed that the creditor was not looking to collect any owed  deficiency\nwithout any apparent elaboration (R.T., at 110-111).  The evidence in the record does\nnot contain any confirmations of collection intentions from either creditor.\nStill, Applicant assures he has no deficiency exposure with either creditor 1.a or\ncreditor1.b (R.T., at 109-111).  While his assurances are certainly plausible, they cannot\nbe verified and adopted without corroborative proof from the underlying documentation\nand/or written confirmation from the creditors themselves.\nFor the past few months, Applicant has been working with a credit building firm to\nresolve his disputes with creditor 1.a and 1.b and have these reported debts removed\nfrom his credit reports (see ex. E). He assures his credit rebuilding efforts have enabled\nhim to increase his credit score to above 700 (R.T., at 74).  He lives in rental housing,\nearns over $3,400.00  a month, and adheres to a budget that nets him over $1,100.00\na month in remainder after all of his expenses and debts have been paid (see ex. 3;\nR.T., at 75, 91-103). \nApplicant has a 401(k) retirement account and a pension plan that are funded by\nhis employer.  He estimates to have between $5,000.00 and $6,000.00 invested in the\ntwo accounts (R.T., at 105).  He enjoys working on military contracts and believes his\noverall finances have improved, and will continue to improve \u201cas time goes on\u201d (R.T., at\n107-108). \nEndorsements and awards\nApplicant did not provide any endorsements from his command or community.\nPotentially helpful but not available either are his company performance evaluations and\nany commendations he may have earned.  \n\n5\nPolicies\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\n\n6\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a system administrator for a defense contractor who accumulated\nseveral delinquent debts over the past several years.  To resolve his credit card\ndelinquencies in 2004, he sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws.  Before\ncompleting his Chapter 7 bankruptcy, he contracted to purchase an investment property\non the strength of a referral from a good friend.  Applicant\u2019s purchase was facilitated by a\nfirst and second mortgage sans any down payment.  When his new partner abandoned\nhis monthly servicing commitments on the purchase, Applicant abandoned his property\ninvestment and accepted non-judicial foreclosure by the lender. Whether or not the\nforeclosing lender actually foreclosed on the property and retains a right to a deficiency\nis unclear. \nPotentially applicable to Applicant\u2019s foreclosure in this case is the state\u2019s anti-\ndeficiency law (CCP, \u00a7 580b).  Section 580b of his state\u2019s code is fairly all encompassing\nas it pertains to debt instruments created to facilitate a purchase of a home in the state.\nCase authorities certainly leave little room for excluding mortgage instruments\nconsidered integral to the financing of the home in question.  The only exception would\nbe if the listed second mortgage with creditor 1.a can be legally characterized as post-\npurchase security, which is not covered by CCP, \u00a7 580b.   Without any furnished loan\ndocumentation, it is difficult to ascertain with any degree of certitude whether the creditor\n1.a debt qualifies as a purchase money obligation eligible for coverage by the state\u2019s\nanti-deficiency law, or falls outside the law\u2019s anti-deficiency exclusion.\nSecurity concerns are raised here under the financial considerations guideline of\nAG \u00b6 18 of the Directive.  Under this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack\nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d AG \u00b6 18.  To resolve his accumulation of significant credit card and student\nloan debt, Applicant (in his early twenties) turned to Chapter 7 bankruptcy for protection.\nHis utilization of Chapter 7 bankruptcy procedures and his exposing himself to potential\ndeficiency enforcement as a result of his post-bankruptcy loan defaults and ensuing\nforeclosure warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the AGs\nfor financial considerations: \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \u00b6\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n\n7\nWhen Applicant made his referenced investment  purchase, he had no capital\nresources of his own to commit and obtained financing of the property with nothing\ndown.  He was still involved in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding at the time and was\nforced to rely on a friend for loan servicing assistance.  Exactly what this friend\ncommitted to and expected to derive from the investment is unclear.  The record lacks\ndocumentation of the purchase and the financial arrangements Applicant reportedly\nmade with this friend.  What made Applicant\u2019s real estate investment especially risky is\nhis absence of any down payment to secure conventional mortgage financing.  Without\ncapital of his own, he relied  on a rising real estate market, an extraordinary institutional\nsupply of leverage capital to fund purchase money needs, and a vast array of available\nmortgage services, to facilitate his investment property purchase.  From the outset,\nApplicant\u2019s purchase was laden with risk,  even in an advancing real estate market.\nFor the first several months following his investment property purchase, Applicant\nand his new partner made the required monthly mortgage payments in a timely way and\nlooked to reaping considerable rewards from their investment.  Their hopes for a quick\nturnaround on their investment were quickly dashed, though, after Applicant\u2019s partner\nceased making payments, and Applicant failed to cover him. \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in financial cases (as here) and bring\ninto play security concerns covered by the financial considerations guideline. \nExtenuating circumstances are not clearly associated with either Applicant\u2019s\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, or his ensuing investment foreclosure.  Based on the\ncircumstances presented here, MC \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibility,\u201d has no visible applicability\nto Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties.   \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has made no manifest attempt to check his\nloan documents to ascertain whether creditor 1.a has a potential deficiency claim that it\ncould conceivably enforce against him.  He assures that creditor 1.a is not seeking a\ndeficiency on its second mortgage position, and he has relied on a credit building firm to\nobtain the removal of creditor 1.a\u2019s debt from his credit reports.  Still, he has not provided\nany loan documentation or other written proof that creditor 1.a has no deficiency\nentitlement.  His limited contacts to date with creditor 1.a and his credit rebuilding firm by\nthemselves are not enough to justify application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \n\n8\nApplicant provides no evidence either of any financial counseling, or personal\nbudgeting.  Without any documented counseling or budgeting in the record, MC \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d may not be applied.\nFrom a whole person standpoint, Applicant fails to provide sufficient anti-\ndeficiency documentation and documented support from his employer, friends or\nacquaintances who are familiar with his work and community contributions and can\nvouchsafe for his good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Nor is he able to\ndocument extenuating circumstances associated with his financial difficulties.  To his\ncredit, Applicant exhibits remorse for his indiscretions, which he attributes to youth and\nimmaturity.  His lifestyle changes to date do reflect some improvements in his managing\nhis finances and are to be encouraged.  At the same time, his efforts in restoring sound\nmanagerial control over his finances remain a work in progress and require additional\nseasoning before safe predictions can be made that his finances are safely stabilized\nand averse recurrence risks.\nTaking into account all of the presented mitigation considerations in this case,\nApplicant fails to mitigate judgment, reliability and trustworthiness concerns related to his\nChapter 7 bankruptcy discharge and his mortgage-related debts. Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the financial\nconsiderations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

His recent effort to resolve his tax debt is not sufficient to mitigate all the \nsecurity concerns raised under criminal conduct and financial considerations. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 6, 2008, Applicant submitted his most recent security clearance \napplication. On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within DoD on September 1, 2006. \nMarch 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted or denied. \n \nOn August 24, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n21, 2009. The scheduling of the hearing was delayed because Applicant was deployed \nto a remote location overseas and there were no compatible teleconference (VTC) \nfacilities available. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 18, 2009. The \nhearing was convened on November 24, 2009. Appellant participated on the VTC from \na remote location overseas. I was located in Arlington, Virginia. The Government \noffered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12. GEs 7 and 12 were admitted over \nApplicant\u2019s hearsay objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) \n1 through 12, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on December 3, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nOn September 29, 2009, Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to schedule \nthe hearing on October 23, 2009. Because of difficulties finding a compatible VTC \nfacility, the hearing was cancelled. On November 18, 2009, it was rescheduled for \nNovember 24, 2009. At his hearing, Applicant indicated he had sufficient time to prepare \nand was ready to proceed. He affirmatively waived his right to 15 days advance notice \nof the hearing. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 2.c, and 2.d. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor \nand testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor. \nHe received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982. He has been married to his wife for 35 \nyears. They have two adult children, ages 34 and 33.  \n \nThrough the years, Applicant has worked for many government contractors and \nagencies. From around September 1985 until 1997, he was employed as an engineer, \nsenior engineer, and engineering scientist for various prominent corporations. \nCommensurate with his employment, he held access to classified information at the \nsecret level between 1976 and 1979. He also had access to classified information at the \ntop secret level with access to sensitive compartmented information (TSSCI) from 1980 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nto 1981, and from 1983 to 1999. Apparently, he was self-employed for a short period in \n1994, and from January 2000 until around April 2008. \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a government contractor from \nApril 2008 to present. He has possessed an interim secret security clearance since April \n2008. He has been deployed to a combat zone during most of his employment, and as \nof his hearing day, he was deployed to a combat zone. He is in charge of the operation \nand maintenance of weapons systems that provide protection to U.S. troops and \npersonnel deployed to the combat zone. There is no evidence Applicant has ever \ncompromised or caused others to compromise classified information. Nor is there any \nevidence that he has ever failed to follow the rules and regulations required to handle \nclassified information.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2008 security clearance application, he indicated the United \nStated had filed liens against him for back taxes. His background investigation \naddressed his financial status and included the review, among other documents, of July \n2008 and May 2009, credit reports (CBRs), three security clearance applications, and \nexcerpts of a civil suit brought against Applicant. In February 2006, the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral brought suit against Applicant and his wife to reduce to judgment federal tax \nassessments made against them for federal income taxes, penalties, and interest.  \n \nApplicant filed his tax return for 1996, but claimed (in part) his wages were not \nsubject to federal income taxation because compensation for labor is not taxable. He \nmade partial payment on the taxes assessed on his 1996 wages. He also failed to file \ntax returns for years 1997 through 2000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.d). Applicant argued in \nfederal court (generally) that he did not have to file tax returns and the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) was acting without valid authority because: he was not a taxpayer, the \nIRS did not comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the IRS did not provide him \nwith proof of tax liability. He lost his case at the Federal District Court level, and the U.S. \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Applicant\u2019s arguments as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d  \n \nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Federal District Court\u2019s decision \n(GE 10). It ruled that Applicant failed to file tax returns for the 1997 \u2013 2000 tax years as \nrequired by law, and that he was indebted to the United States for the federal income \ntaxes assessed against him for the 1996 \u2013 2000 tax years, plus interest and penalties, \ntotaling approximately $182,480 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). The IRS liens filed against him \nwere declared valid and ordered foreclosed. Applicant\u2019s three timeshare properties and \nhis home were awarded to the United States and sold to pay his IRS liens.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a. He claimed that, although he did not \nfile a tax return for years 1997 through 2000, three other documents that were filed with \nthe IRS were the equivalent of him filing a tax return: (1) his employer providing a copy \nof his W-2 form to the IRS; (2) the IRS reconstruction of Applicant\u2019s 1040 to conduct his \ntax assessments; and (3) statements he filed with the IRS requesting a determination \nhe was not liable for taxes. Absent documentary evidence in the form of specific \ncitations to the law or federal cases to support his claims, Applicant\u2019s testimony alone is \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \ninsufficient to prove his claims. Moreover, the Federal District Court and the U.S. Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals concluded Applicant failed to file tax returns for the years in \nquestion as he was required to do by law, and that the federal income taxes assessed \nagainst him for the 1996 \u2013 2000 tax years were legal.1  \n \nApplicant admitted the two judgments in favor of the United States alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. He partially paid his 1996 assessed income tax and failed to file \nfederal tax returns for the 1997 \u2013 2000 tax years. He became indebted to the United \nStates for the income taxes assessed against him, plus interests and penalties, totaling \n$182,480. Applicant\u2019s real estate properties were seized, awarded to the United States, \nand sold to pay approximately $82,747 towards his IRS liens. Applicant still owes \naround $99,700 to the IRS.  \n \nIn 2009, Applicant received an IRS Notice of Levy collecting $308,576 for past \ndue taxes. He believes the total amount in collection is incorrect because the IRS failed \nto account for the $82,747 paid through the foreclosure and sale of his real estate \nproperties. He wrote to the IRS seeking to settle the debt in 2009. He asked the IRS for \nthe minimum amount it will accept in full payment. In his letter, Applicant stated that if \nthe IRS was not willing to reduce his debt, he \u201cmay have no other alternative but to file \nbankruptcy to settle this debt or wait until the statute of limitations runs out which is Feb \n[sic] 2014\u201d (AE 5). As of the day of his hearing, he had not received a response from the \nIRS. Except for the payment made as a result of the forfeiture and sale of his property, \nApplicant has made no other payments to the IRS.  \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant denied he is indebted to the state of Maryland \nfor a tax lien filed against him, because the state of limitations ran out and the debt is no \nlonger valid. He believes the tax lien dates back to at least 1996 (or prior years); \nbecause that is the last year he lived in the state. He claimed he timely filed his state tax \nreturns while he lived in Maryland. Applicant intends to contest the state lien on the \nbasis that the debt is no longer valid because of the passing of the statute of limitations. \nHe is having difficulty disputing the state lien while deployed to a combat zone. \nApplicant did not present documentary evidence showing he timely filed his 1996 state \ntax returns, or that the statute of limitations has not been tolled, and the debt (state lien) \nis uncollectable. Even if the statute of limitations was tolled, the passing of the statute of \nlimitations in of itself does not automatically mitigate financial considerations concerns.2 \n \n1 DOHA proceedings are not a proper forum for challenging the validity of a civil judgment entered against \nan applicant. The validity of the federal taxes (and interest and penalties) assessed against him by the \nIRS may be challenged; however, there is a presumption of regularity that Applicant has failed to rebut. \nSee ISCR Case No. 00-0596 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 4, 2001); ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002) (internal citations omitted).  \n \n2 The statute of limitations ends an Applicant\u2019s legal responsibility to pay the creditor after the passage of \na certain amount of time, as specified in state law. Notwithstanding, within the context of the security \nclearance process, the passing of the statute of limitations does not automatically mitigates financial \nconsiderations concerns under AG \u00b6 20(d). See ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); \nADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nApplicant filed no federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2000 through \n2008. During that period, he was self-employed (performing lawn mowing services,  \ncomputer repairs, and designing filters). He claimed he did not make the minimum \nincome required to file federal tax returns. He also lived in a state that does not have \nincome taxation. He testified he intends to file his 2009 income tax return.  \n \nApplicant repeatedly stated it has never been his intention to defraud the U.S. \nGovernment or to fail to pay anything he owes to the United States. He argued that \nbecause there is no statute that authorizes personal liability for income taxation, he \ncannot be liable for income taxes. He firmly believes that he is exercising his rights \nunder the U.S. Constitution. At the same time, he is trying to look for legal solutions to \nsettle his IRS debt.  \n \nApplicant is a proud, loyal American. He noted he has been risking his life \nprotecting U.S. soldiers, personnel, and property in a foreign combat zone. He appears \nto be a dedicated, knowledgeable worker, and an asset to his employer.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. \nDec. 29, 2008). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d3 Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \nApplicant filed his tax return for 1996, but claimed his wages were not subject to \nfederal income taxation. He made partial payment on the taxes assessed on his 1996 \nwages. He also willfully failed to file tax returns for years 1997 through 2000, and \nbecame indebted to the United States for $182,480 for the federal income taxes \nassessed against him, plus interest and penalties. Applicant\u2019s real estate properties \nwere seized, awarded to the United States, and sold to pay approximately $82,747 \ntowards his IRS liens and judgments. Applicant still owes around $99,700 to the IRS. \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nExcept for the payment made as a result of the forfeiture and sale of his property, \nApplicant has made no other payments to the IRS. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior violated Section 7203 of Title 26 of the U.S. Code (USC), \nand constitutes a federal offense.4 His behavior raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that none applies. Applicant \nfailed to file federal tax returns for years 1997 through 2000. The last offense occurred \n10 years ago, however, I do not consider the offenses temporally remote because \nApplicant has not resolved the issues related to his failure to file his tax returns and to \npay federal income taxes. He still owes the IRS a substantial sum of money. He has not \nmade any payments towards his IRS debt, except for the sum paid as a result of the \nforfeiture and sale of his property. I give Applicant credit for sending the IRS a letter in \n2009, attempting to settle his tax debt. Notwithstanding, considering the reasons he \nincurred the debt, the amount of the debt, and the period during which the debt has \nbeen outstanding, Applicant\u2019s recent effort to resolve his debt is insufficient to mitigate \nthe concerns.  \n \n \nMoreover, Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for years 2000 through \n2008. He claimed he was not required to file a federal income tax return for any of those \ntax years because his gross income was under the specific amount set by law to file a \n                                            \n4 Title 26, U.S.C., Sec. 7203, makes it a Federal misdemeanor for anyone to willfully fail to file a federal \nincome tax return, supply information, or pay such tax when he is required to do so by the Internal \nRevenue laws or regulations. \n\n \n8 \n \n \ntax return. In light of his past willful failure to file tax returns and to pay federal income \ntaxes, his testimony alone is not sufficient to fully raise any of the Guideline J mitigating \nconditions.  \n \n \nDuring his hearing, Applicant argued the same tax protester theories he \nunsuccessfully raised in Federal Court justifying his failure to file tax returns and to pay \nincome tax. Considering the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s evidence \nfails to show successful rehabilitation or remorse. I also find Applicant\u2019s behavior \ncontinues to cast doubt on his judgment. The Guideline J security concern is not \nmitigated. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant failed to file federal tax returns for years 1997 through 2000. He \nbecame indebted to the United States for the income taxes assessed against him for tax \nyears 1997 through 2000, plus interests and penalties, totaling $182,480. He failed to \npay the assessed taxes and the IRS filed tax liens against him. The liens were \nforeclosed in federal court and the IRS obtained two judgments in favor of the United \nStates (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). Applicant\u2019s real estate properties were seized, awarded to \nthe United States, and sold to pay approximately $82,747 towards his IRS liens and \njudgments. Applicant still owes around $99,700 to the IRS. Except for the payment \nmade as a result of the forfeiture and sale of his property, Applicant has made no other \npayments to the IRS. \n \nIn 2009, Applicant wrote to the IRS seeking to settle the debt. He asked for the \nminimum amount the IRS will accept in full payment. In his letter, Applicant stated that if \nthe IRS was not willing to reduce his debt, he \u201cmay have no other alternative but to file \nbankruptcy to settle this debt or wait until the statute of limitations runs out which is Feb \n[sic] 2014.\u201d As of the day of his hearing, he had not received a response from the IRS.  \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant denied he is indebted to the state of Maryland \nfor a tax lien filed against him, because the state of limitations ran out and the debt is no \nlonger valid. He believes the tax lien dates back to at least 1996 (or prior years); \nbecause that is the last year he lived in the state. He claimed he timely filed his state tax \nreturns while he lived in Maryland. Applicant intends to contest the state lien on the \nbasis that the debt is no longer valid because of the passing of the statute of limitations. \nHe is having difficulty disputing the state lien while deployed to a combat zone. \nApplicant did not present documentary evidence showing he timely filed his 1996 (or \n\n \n9 \n \n \nprior years) state tax returns, or that the statute of limitations has not been tolled and \nthat this debt (state lien ) is uncollectable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations;\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(g): \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nApplicant presented evidence to show that he has partially paid the judgments \nfiled against him, and that in 2009, he attempted to settle his IRS debt. Notwithstanding, \nfor the same reasons set forth in my discussion of the Guideline J mitigating conditions, \nincorporated herein, I conclude none of the Guideline F mitigating conditions apply. I \nfind Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent, likely to recur, and that it still casts doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s judgment. He presented little evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndebts. His actions cast doubt on his current judgment. Financial considerations \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man, and a \ngood father and husband. He appears to be a competent and dedicated worker. In the \npast, he worked well for government contractors and held access to classified \ninformation at the TSSCI level. There is no evidence he has ever compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant is a loyal and patriotic American. He has been deployed to a combat \nzone, risking his life, during most of his current employment. He is in charge of the \noperation and maintenance of weapons systems that provide protection to U.S. troops \nand personnel deployed to the combat zone. These factors show some responsibility, \ntrustworthiness, and mitigation. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, the evidence against granting a security clearance is more \nsubstantial. His willful failure to file tax returns and to pay his income taxes shows he \nhas a problem with complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. His recent effort to resolve his tax debt is not sufficient to mitigate all the \nsecurity concerns raised by his past behavior. He failed to file several tax returns and to \ntake reasonable steps to address his tax obligations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n5 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant encountered financial \ndifficulties since 2001 as a result of some failed businesses and sporadic \nunemployment.  The SOR alleges 14 delinquent accounts, totaling over $93,000. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifts to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Most \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts remain unresolved. It is unlikely that Applicant will be \nable to resolve his accounts in the near future based on his current income and the \namount of the debt. Applicant\u2019s financial issues raise questions about his reliability and \ngood judgment.    \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s history of \nsporadic employment. However, Applicant neglected his debts during periods that he \nwas employed. His approach has been to passively wait for the seven-year period to \npass so that the debts would be removed in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct rather than pay his financial obligations. I cannot conclude that he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. For this reason, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less \nweight.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not received financial counseling. He still has \nsignificant financial problems which are unlikely to be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant accepts \nresponsibility for the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he has not been able to make \nregular payments towards this debt because of his under-employment. He has made no \npayments towards the remaining accounts. Applicant\u2019s plan to resolve his delinquent \naccounts is to wait for them to be removed from his credit report after seven years in \n\n \n7 \n \n \naccordance with Section 605 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  However, the Appeal \nBoard has held that the fact that debts will be removed from an applicant\u2019s credit history \nin the near future does not preclude their review for security purposes: \n \n\u2026the removal of those debts from his credit report does not make them \ndisappear as if they never existed or preclude the Judge from considering \nother record evidence that shows those debts exist. The security \nsignificance of Applicant\u2019s credit history does not turn on whether \nApplicant\u2019s debts could or could not be legally listed on a credit report after \nthe passage of seven years. ISCR 02-14950 at 4 (App. Bd. May 15, \n20030; See ISCR Case 98-0111 at 3 (App. Bd. November 13, 1998).   \n \nFor the reasons mentioned above, Applicant has not demonstrated a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. While Applicant disputes several debts, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence to conclude that there is a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s significant financial issues remain. He did not meet his burden of \nproof to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s active duty \nservice in the United States Navy. I considered his history of unemployment and under-\nemployment. The majority of Applicant\u2019s accounts remain unresolved. His financial \nproblems are not likely to be resolved in the near future. Applicant has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  He did not \nmitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nAugust 31, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP), on December 7, 2007 (Government Exhibit 1). On August 6, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign\nInfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 24, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non September 21, 2009. I received the case assignment on September 24, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 28, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on October 27, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through D, which were also admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing, and the record closed on\nNovember 10, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant was 57 at the date of the hearing, and married to his second wife. He is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and seeks a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment in the defense industry.  Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nthe SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. However, he denied\nthat his status or conduct shows that he is ineligible for a security clearance. He also\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has acted in a way that shows a preference for another country\ninstead of the United States. \nApplicant was born in Romania and grew up in Czechoslovakia. After the fall of\nthe Iron Curtain, and the split up of Czechoslovakia, he was determined to be a Slovak\ncitizen. He went to college in Czechoslovakia and received a master\u2019s degree. In 1975\nand 1976, he served in the Czechoslovak Army, as was required of all men. \nApplicant met his second wife in Slovakia in the mid-1990s. She was born in\nCzechoslovakia, and became an American citizen in 1988. They were married in the\nUnited States in 1997. Applicant became an American citizen in 2004. (Government\nExhibit 1 at Section 8.)\nApplicant has retained his Slovak citizenship to preserve his pension or\nretirement rights in Slovakia. Applicant worked for a state-owned heavy industry\ncompany first in Czechoslovakia, then Slovakia, from 1975 through 1997. This company\nis now owned by an American firm. Because of his 22 years of employment, the\nApplicant has acquired significant pension rights in Slovakia. According to the Applicant,\nthis pension is administered by the Slovak government, and not the American company\nthat now owns his former employer. Applicant also indicated several times that he\nbelieves he must retain his Slovak citizenship in order to keep those pension rights.\nApplicant has no intent or desire to revoke his Slovak citizenship, due to his pension\nrights. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 8, Exhibit 2 at 7-8; Transcript at 31-36, 56-59.)\n\n3\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nApplicant has two married daughters from his first marriage who are Slovak\ncitizens and live in Europe. One lives in the Czech Republic and the other in Spain.\nNone of the Applicant\u2019s relatives in Europe have any connection with any European\ngovernment. He contacts them on a fairly regular basis. (Government Exhibit 2 at 3-6;\nTranscript at 41-48, 51-52.)\nApplicant travels to Europe about every year to visit his daughters. He does not\nhave a valid Slovak passport and only uses his American passport while traveling.\n(Transcript at 33-34, 38-39, 49-50.)\nMitigation\nApplicant has substantial personal and financial interests in the United States.\nHis wife is a naturalized American citizen. Her children, the Applicant\u2019s step-children,\nare all native-born Americans and currently live in the United States. The Applicant\u2019s net\nworth is about $700,000. (Transcript at 36-39, 48-54.)\nApplicant is a respected person in his field. He submitted two letters of\nrecommendation. One was from his Director, who describes the Applicant as showing\n\u201cloyalty, dedication and commitment.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A.) A coworker describes the\nApplicant as \u201ca fine upstanding citizen.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B.) \nApplicant submitted two recent Performance Management Worksheets. He met\nor exceeded expectations in every category. (Applicant Exhibits C and D.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n4\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own\ncommon sense, as well as his or her knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways\nof the world, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the applicant's conduct and the\ngranting or continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been\nestablished, the burden then shifts to the applicant to go forward with evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case. The applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\n\n5\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security\nclearance.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nApplicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s concerns about his dual citizenship\nwith Slovakia.  The concern is stated thus under this Guideline, When an individual acts\nin such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States,\nthen he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful\nto the interests of the United States. \nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant is a dual citizen of Slovakia and the United States, and that he\nhas no intention of revoking his Slovak citizenship in order to protect his possible\npension benefits in Slovakia. The Applicant\u2019s one year of service in the now defunct\nCzechoslovak Army is mitigated because it occurred over 30 years ago, during a time\nwhen he was a citizen of that country.\nApplicant continues to be a dual citizen of the United States and Slovakia,\nand does not intend to change that situation in the near future.  Accordingly, AG \u00b610\napplies to the facts of this case: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include: (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: (5) using foreign citizenship to protect\nfinancial or business interests in another country. \nThe Applicant has repeatedly stated that he will not revoke his Slovak citizenship.\nAG \u00b611(b) does not apply to this case: the individual has expressed a willingness to\nrenounce dual citizenship.  None of the other mitigating conditions are applicable to this\ncase. Guideline C is found against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\n\n6\nThe Applicant has family connections to Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Spain.\nHe travels to Europe on a fairly frequent basis to visit his two daughters.\nThe following Disqualifying Conditions apply to this case based solely on the\nfacts: \nAG \u00b67.(a) contact with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by\nproviding that information. \nApplicant has proved that he is a conscientious and patriotic citizen, and member\nof the defense industry. He has substantial family and financial ties in the United States\nthat outweigh his relationship to any European country, except as discussed under\nGuideline C, above. While he still has family in Europe, the Applicant has shown that his\nloyalties are to the United States.\nApplicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following Mitigating\nConditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background: \nAG \u00b68(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country\nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nBased on my analysis of the available information, the Applicant has overcome\nthe adverse inference of his family members\u2019 presence in Europe.  Guideline B is found\nfor the Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\n\n7\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. My Guideline B and C analysis is\napplicable to the whole-person analysis as well. The evidence shows that the Applicant\nis a patriotic American citizen. The problem here is that he is consciously retaining his\nSlovak citizenship in order to protect pension or retirement benefits from that country.\nFor that reason, I cannot find that there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8). Using the whole-person standard,\nthe Applicant has not mitigated the security significance of his foreign preference and is\nnot eligible for a security clearance. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nParagraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on December 22, 2005 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 5). On June 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines F \nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nNovember 25, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 30, 2009; answered it on August 7, 2009 \n(GX 4); and requested determination on the record without a hearing. DOHA received \nhis response on August 11, 2009. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s \nwritten case on August 27, 2009. On September 1, 2009, a complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on September 9, 2009, but he did not respond. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 3, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR 1.b through \n1.r. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old data monitor employed by a federal contractor. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1990 to June 2002. After his \nrelease from active duty, he was unemployed until January 2003. His security clearance \napplication reflects that he has been employed by federal contractors since January \n2003, except for a one-week period of unemployment in mid-January 2005. That period \nof unemployment ended when he was hired by his current employer. He does not have \na security clearance. \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his security clearance application in December 2005, \nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27 on his security clearance application, asking if any \njudgments had been filed against him in the last seven years that were unpaid. He also \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 28, asking if he was currently more than 90 days delinquent \non any debts. His credit report dated January 18, 2006 reflected an unsatisfied \njudgment entered against him in July 2004 for $2,107, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (GX 10 \nat 3). The same credit report also reflected the $1,436 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, \ncharged off in March 2005; the $209 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j, charged off in February \n2004; the $878 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p, sent to collection in March 2005; and the \n$482 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q, sent to collection in 2002 (GX 10 at 4-6, 8-9). \n \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant told a security investigator that the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b arose during a two-month period of unemployment (GX 6 at 3). His \nsecurity clearance application reflects continuous employment from January 2003 until \nthe present, except for a one-week period in January 2005 (GX 5 at 8-12). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling $21,113. Applicant told a security \ninvestigator he was disputing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (GX 7 at 3). In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated he had contacted the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and was \nawaiting information, and that he was negotiating a settlement of the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. He admitted all the remaining debts and stated that they would be paid off in \nperiods ranging from one month to eight months. He did not respond to the FORM and \ndid not submit evidence that any of the debts were resolved. \n \n\n \n3\n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying his security clearance \napplication. He stated he did not fully understand the questions (GX 4 at 4). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n\n \n4\n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised \nwhen there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when \nthere is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, \nand/or other financial analysis.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial history raises all three disqualifying \nconditions, shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, ongoing, and not \nthe product of circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s \n\n \n5\ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant attributed the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b to a two-month period of unemployment, but that \nexplanation is not supported by the information he provided in his security clearance \napplication. He has asserted no other circumstances beyond his control. This mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence of financial \ncounseling and Applicant\u2019s financial situation is not under control. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant has not presented any evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nsuggested to a security investigator that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was disputed, \nbut he provided no documentation to show the basis for the dispute or actions to resolve \nit. He has admitted all the other debts.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \n\n \n6\n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). Applicant\u2019s only explanation for his failure to disclose the \nunsatisfied judgment and his delinquent debts was that he did not fully understand the \nquestion. He has not explained what he did not understand or what he thought the \nquestion was asking. He has not claimed he was unaware of the debts. I conclude that \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established because the record \ncontains no evidence that Applicant made prompt good-faith efforts to correct his \nomissions.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s falsification was not a minor offense, it involved his current security \nclearance application, and it did not occur under unique circumstances. The third \nelement (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is established because the two falsifications occurred at the \nsame time and there is no other evidence of untruthful behavior, but Applicant\u2019s lack of \ncandor on his application casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n7\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has worked in federal service for many years. He \nhas offered little evidence to explain how he accumulated his delinquent debts and \nvirtually no evidence of efforts to resolve them. My ability to evaluate his credibility is \nlimited, because he did not request a hearing. His explanation for failing to disclose the \nderogatory financial information on his security clearance application is facially \nimplausible.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, who is 26 years old, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology in May 2008. He is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in biotechnology (Tr. 85-88). He is single and has no children. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as an assistant scientist since July 2008. At that time, he submitted his first security clearance application (GE 1; Tr. 85-88). Between 2001 and 2006, Applicant was terminated from several jobs. In 2001, when Applicant was 17, he worked as a summer camp counselor. He was terminated for drinking alcohol while on the premises.

Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing   \n(e-QIP) on July 2, 2008. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were \nunable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n1 \nDecember 16, 2009\n\n \n \nOn June 23 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \n \nApplicant submitted a notarized, undated Answer, which was received by DOHA \non July 13, 2009. Applicant admitted all allegations under Guideline H and Guideline E \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on August 31, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on the same \nday. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on September 9, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on October 6, 2009. Government counsel offered three exhibits, marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. I took \nadministrative notice of two documents provided by the government, identified as \nHearing Exhibits I and II. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented the \ntestimony of four witnesses. He also offered seven exhibits, marked as Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through G, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript on October 13, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, \nand the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, who is 26 years old, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology in May \n2008. He is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in biotechnology (Tr. 85-88). He is \nsingle and has no children. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as an \nassistant scientist since July 2008. At that time, he submitted his first security clearance \napplication (GE 1; Tr. 85-88). \n \nBetween 2001 and 2006, Applicant was terminated from several jobs. In 2001, \nwhen Applicant was 17, he worked as a summer camp counselor. He was terminated for \ndrinking alcohol while on the premises. He admits that he was drinking alcohol with \nfriends at the time, and was under the legal age to consume alcohol (Tr. 90-92). In 2005, \nwhen he was 22 years old, Applicant worked at the counter of a coffee bar. He was \nterminated for drinking beverages without paying for them. He was given a warning after \nthe first time, and was terminated after the second instance (Tr. 93-95). Applicant worked \nat another coffee bar from June 2007 to November 2008. His supervisor in that position \n                                                 \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n2 \n\n \nsubmitted a character reference stating that Applicant had not used any products without \npurchasing them during his employment (AE G). \n \nApplicant's third termination occurred in 2006, when he was 23. Applicant worked \nfor a pizza delivery company. He informed his supervisor that he could not work on \nSundays. Initially, he was not scheduled for that day, but eventually, the supervisor \nassigned him to work Sundays. Applicant called in sick when he was not sick when he \nwas assigned to work on Sunday, and later, failed to report to work if assigned on \nSunday. He was terminated for excessive absences (GE 1, 2; Tr. 96-99). \n \nDuring his senior year of high school, at the age of 17, Applicant began using \nmarijuana. He used it until August 2007, when he was 24 years old (Tr. 106). His use \nvaried: he used it from two to three times per week from 2001 to 2002, then once or \ntwice per month from 2002 to 2004. His use increased in 2004 until he was using \nmarijuana almost daily toward the end of 2004. At that point, he left the out-of-state \nuniversity he was attending and returned home. While living at home, he began \nattending a local university in the fall of 2005. His use decreased to once or twice per \nweek. He briefly abstained from marijuana use between April and August 2006. He \nabstained to show that he was not addicted to marijuana. After deciding he was not \naddicted, he returned to using marijuana, gradually increasing his usage from twice per \nmonth, to once per week, and by the end of the fall semester, he was using it two to \nthree times per week. Applicant continued at this pace until about May 2007. Using the \ndrug made him complacent and had a negative effect on his grades. He began to \ndecrease his usage until he decided, in August 2007, to quit entirely (GE 2, 3; Tr. 106-\n111).  \n \nOver the years, Applicant used marijuana with friends, and usually obtained it by \npurchasing it. When he moved back to his parents\u2019 home in 2005, he used it with his \nyounger brother and his brother\u2019s friends, and obtained it from them. He no longer lives \nat his parents\u2019 home. He does see his younger brother at weekly family gatherings, but \nthey do not associate socially, as they used to in the past. He last associated with his \nbrother\u2019s friends in August 2007. He testified that he no longer associates with any of the \npeople with whom he used marijuana in high school or college (GE 2, 3; Tr. 111-117). \n \nIn addition to marijuana, Applicant used other drugs illegally including ecstasy, \ngamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and cocaine. Over a six-month period from 2001 to \n2002, Applicant purchased and used the drug GHB without a prescription.3 He used it \n                                                 \n3 Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a central nervous system depressant whose use is specifically \nrestricted by the Food and Drug Administration to the treatment of narcolepsy. Known as a \u201cclub drug,\u201d it \nis often abused by teenagers and young adults at clubs and weekend-long parties called raves. Repeated \nuse can cause insomnia, anxiety, tremors and sweating. Use can result in seizures. At high doses, the \nsedative effects can cause sleep, coma, or death (Hearing Exhibit I: National Institute on Drug Abuse, \n\u201cClub Drugs (GHB, Ketamine, and Rohypnol)\u201d June 2009). \n \n \n3 \n\n \napproximately six times, paying $5 each time. He was 18 years old and was attending an \nout-of-state college at the time. Applicant also used ecstasy4 two times during a \nweekend in the Fall of 2005, when he was 21 years old (GE 3; Tr. 117-120).  \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant tried cocaine three times. Shortly after, he used \nmarijuana again. He testified that he decided that month to stop using illegal drugs and \nhas not used any since that time. He believes he initially used marijuana because of peer \npressure, and later as a way to self-medicate when he was depressed (GE 3; Tr. 120-\n125). \n \nApplicant experienced depression for a number of years. He believes he \nincreased his marijuana use in 2004, in part, to deal with his depression. He began \ncounseling in March 2005. He took prescribed medication to treat his depression. The \nmedication was no longer required after August 2007. He completed therapy in January \n2009. He credits the counseling with helping him to end his use of illegal drugs (GE 1; Tr. \n126-127). \n \nApplicant testified about the negative effects marijuana use has had on his life. It \ncaused him to waste money, waste time, and it interfered with his school performance. \nHe testified that he would have graduated approximately three years earlier if he had not \nbeen using illegal drugs. He believes that his employment difficulties stemmed from the \ncomplacency he felt when he used drugs. Applicant testified that he has no intent to use \nillegal drugs in the future. He submitted a document stating his intent not to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. He also submitted the results of two random drug screenings \nperformed by his current employer. The results of both tests, performed on December \n10, 2008 and May 28, 2009, were negative (GE 2; AE D, F; Tr. 102-103, 128-130). \n \n \nApplicant's witnesses included his current supervisor, his girlfriend, his supervisor \nfrom a previous job, and his brother. His current supervisor described Applicant as \nexemplary in accounting for his time at work, and a reliable worker who is conscientious \nand punctual (Tr. 25-28). She prepared his June 2009 performance evaluation, in which \nshe found that he met expectations in all categories (AE A). Applicant's section manager \nsubmitted a character reference that also attests to his attention to detail and willingness \nto perform extra tasks to accomplish a goal (AE E). His girlfriend, who is also his co-\nworker, testified that Applicant has not used drugs in the one-and-one-half years that she \nhas known him. He is a reliable worker and a trustworthy friend (AE A, E; Tr. 68-75). \nApplicant and his brother live together. He testified that he knows Applicant does not use \n                                                 \n4 Ecstasy is the common name for the psychoactive drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). It \nwas initially popular among adolescents and young adults, who used it at clubs and raves. It produces \nfeelings of energy and euphoria, as well as distortions in time perception and tactile experience. MDMA \ncauses confusion, depression, sleep problems, drug craving, and severe anxiety. The effect can occur \ndays or weeks after ingestion. Animal studies have shown that harm to the brain was still apparent six to \nseven years after ingestion. Some people become addicted to MDMA (Hearing Exhibit II: National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse, \u201cInfoFacts: MDMA (Ecstasy)\u201d June 2009). \n \n4 \n\n \nmarijuana based on Applicant's behavior, and the fact that there has been no negative \neffect on their finances (AE C; Tr. 50, 55).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to \ndeny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must \nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its \nburden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.8 \n \n \n                                                 \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability \nand \ntrustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nOf the eight disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 25, the following are relevant:  \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \n \nApplicant admits to illegally using several substances including marijuana, cocaine, \necstasy, and GHB. He purchased most of these drugs. Applicant's use of ecstasy, \ncocaine, and GHB was infrequent. However, he used marijuana over a seven-year \nperiod from 2000 to 2007, beginning when he was 17 and ending when he was 24. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent, long-standing, and demonstrated poor \njudgment and willingness to break the law. Both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 includes two relevant mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such \nas:  \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused;  \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n6 \n\n \n \n7 \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n` \nOver a six-year period from 2001 to 2007, Applicant used cocaine three times, \nGHB about six times, and ecstasy twice. I find that this use was infrequent and \nexperimental in nature. However, his use of marijuana is more problematic, because it \nwas frequent and long-standing. It began when he was a teenager, and continued while \nhe was in college. Applicant credibly testified that he ended his use in August 2007, \nmore than two years ago. Since then, he has completed his bachelor\u2019s degree, and \nbegun a master\u2019s degree program. He has completed therapy for depression, which had \nbeen part of the reason for his marijuana use. He has taken on a full-time job as an \nassistant scientist, is performing responsibly, and is well-regarded by his supervisor and \nco-worker. Both his brother/roommate and his girlfriend, who are in constant association \nwith him, testified that there has been no sign that he is using illegal drugs. Both of the \nrandom drug tests administered by his employer in 2008 and 2009 were negative. \nApplicant is unlikely to return to marijuana use. These facts support a finding of current \ntrustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \n \n \nMitigation is also available under AG \u00b6 26(b) (1) \u2013 (4). Applicant no longer lives in \nhis parents\u2019 home, where he spent time with his younger brother and the friends with \nwhom he used drugs. He does see his younger brother at family gatherings, but does \nnot associate with him socially. He also has had no recent contact with the friends with \nwhom he used drugs while he was attending the out-of-state college in 2001-2002. \nApplicant has abstained from illegal drugs for more than two years. He submitted a \nstatement attesting to the fact that he will not use illegal drugs in the future, with \nautomatic revocation of any security clearance for drug use. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ndemonstrates a commitment to avoiding illegal drug use. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure \nto cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n\n \n \n8 \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for \nan adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach \nof client confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in \nthe workplace;  \n \nBetween 2001 and 2006, Applicant acted inappropriately and unreliably on the \njob by failing to appear for work as required and informing his supervisor that he was \nsick when he was not; taking beverages twice without authorization while working at a \ncoffee bar; and drinking alcohol on an employer\u2019s premises. In each case, his \nemployment was terminated. AG \u00b6 16 (d)(1) and (2) apply. \n \nOne mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 17 is relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAlthough disregard for an employer\u2019s rules is not minor, the most recent event \noccurred in 2006, more than three years ago. In addition, Applicant\u2019s employment \nproblems occurred when he was young, 17 to 22 years old. All of the events occurred \nduring the time period when he was using marijuana. Significant aspects of Applicant's \nlife circumstances have changed since then. Most importantly, he no longer uses \nmarijuana, which caused the complacency that affected his job performance. \nMoreover, he provided evidence that he has performed well for the past one-and-one-\nhalf years at his current job, where his supervisor describes him as reliable, accurate, \nand punctual. Given these changes, he is unlikely to repeat his past errors. AG \u00b6 17(c) \napplies. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs between the ages of 17 and 24. Most were used on \nan experimental basis, but his marijuana use was frequent and long-standing. He was \nmotivated by a desire to \u201cfit in\u201d and to deal with his depression. He attended counseling \nfor depression from 2005 to 2009. He ended his marijuana use in August 2007, \nmidway through his counseling. He had several instances of poor job performance, all \nof which occurred while he was using marijuana. He has refrained from using illegal \ndrugs for almost two-and-one-half years. He now holds a responsible, full-time job \nwhere he has been performing well for the past one-and-one-half years. His decision to \nend his marijuana use, as well as his demonstrated on-the-job reliability, show \nincreased maturity and reflect positively on his current trustworthiness.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 2.c.:  \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.
