Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 29, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip J. Katauskas granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  For reasons stated below, the Judge\u2019s decision is remanded.\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline F were not raised as an issue on appeal.  At\nissue is the Judge\u2019s favorable finding under Guideline E that alleged Applicant\u2019s employment with\na defense contractor was terminated in December 2015 \u201cbecause [he] gave the company false and/or\nmisleading information to obtain and continue leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\u201d \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he was currently working for a military agency, that he\nhas held that position since December 2016, and that he has been granted a Top Secret security\nclearance since 1999.  He also stated that a Federal contractor was sponsoring him for an\nemployment position, but he did not intend to accept that position if he retained his security\nclearance.  Tr. at 17-18. \nDirective \u00b6 4.4 provides that security clearance adjudications \u201cshall cease upon termination\nof the applicant\u2019s need for access to classified information,\u201d with exceptions not pertinent to this\ncase.  Neither party raised the issue of jurisdiction on appeal.  Lack of subject matter jurisdiction can\nbe raised at any time in the proceedings, including sua sponte by the Appeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-24227 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2003).  In this case, it appears there is an issue as to\nwhether Applicant\u2019s need for an industrial security clearance terminated prior to the date of his\nsecurity clearance hearing.\nGiven these circumstances, we conclude that best course of action is to remand the case to\nthe Judge to determine whether he had jurisdiction to issue his decision.  The Judge may reopen the\nrecord to permit the parties the opportunity to offer evidence and arguments on the above\njurisdictional issue.  If the Judge in consultation with the parties determines that he lacked\njurisdiction to issue the decision, he shall vacate that prior decision and indicate it is null and void\nand has no legal effect.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, who is in her 60s, owns a company that provides services to the Federal Government. She is married with adult children. She has earned a master\u2019s degree. She comes from a large family and has provided financial support to her mother and ailing siblings. She also experienced medical issues. In 2007, she expended a significant sum defending herself in a lawsuit. While starting a company, she reported losses to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 2010-2012. The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns for 2007-2016 in a timely manner; she was indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for 2007-2010, 2013, and 2015-2016, which totaled over $170,000; she had a Federal tax lien filed against her for over $50,000 in 2013; she had a state tax lien filed against her for about $8,800; and she was indebted to her state for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $17,700. In responding to the SOR, she admitted all of those allegations. In her 2014 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that she owed the IRS delinquent taxes. In a background interview, she made statements about her efforts to resolve her tax problems that were not accurate. At the time of hearing, Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax returns had been filed, and she had payment plans in place with the IRS and the state.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAllison R. Weber, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 18, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 8, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings were flawed,\nwhether the Judge was biased, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E were not raised as an issue on\nappeal.1  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in her 60s, owns a company that provides services to the Federal\nGovernment.  She is married with adult children.  She has earned a master\u2019s degree.  She comes from\na large family and has provided financial support to her mother and ailing siblings.  She also\nexperienced medical issues.  In 2007, she expended a significant sum defending herself in a lawsuit. \nWhile starting a company, she reported losses to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 2010-2012.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns for\n2007-2016 in a timely manner; she was indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for\n2007-2010, 2013, and 2015-2016, which totaled over $170,000; she had a Federal tax lien filed\nagainst her for over $50,000 in 2013; she had a state tax lien filed against her for about $8,800; and\nshe was indebted to her state for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $17,700.  In\nresponding to the SOR, she admitted all of those allegations.\nIn her 2014 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that she owed the IRS\ndelinquent taxes.  In a background interview, she made statements about her efforts to resolve her\ntax problems that were not accurate.  At the time of hearing, Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax returns had\nbeen filed, and she had payment plans in place with the IRS and the state.  Her IRS tax transcripts\nreflect that, as of early 2018, she owed delinquent Federal taxes for 2007-2009, 2013, and 2015-2016\nas alleged in the SOR; however, those delinquencies were eventually resolved.  She stated her\nremaining tax debt was solely for 2018.  She provided no proof of payments in 2019 even though\nDepartment Counsel requested proof of recent payments.  The Judge requested Applicant provide\nher IRS tax transcripts for 2017 and 2018, but she did not provide them.\n1 Although they were cited by Department Counsel to refute the allegations of bias. \n2\n\nIn October 2019, the state tax authority informed Applicant that she had a delinquency of\nabout $40,400.  She established a payment plan with the state that requires her to make 36 monthly\npayments of $1,300, which were scheduled to start in November 2019.  Applicant\u2019s budget reflects\nthat she has sufficient income to pay her tax debts.  She described her tax problems as an unusual\noccurrence that have been resolved with the exception of her existing payment plans with the Federal\nand state taxing authorities. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant filed some of her tax returns before the expiration of extension periods, and she\nmay not have been required to file returns for other years.  However, she did not file her tax returns\nfor 2009, 2010, and 2014 as required.  She did not pay Federal income taxes for 2007-2009,  2013,\nand 2015-2016 when they were due.  The Judge entered favorable SOR findings on an allegation\nasserting she owed delinquent Federal taxes for 2010 because it was not true and on the tax lien\nallegations because that indebtedness was addressed in other alleged tax debts. \nThe Judge noted that, even though not alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s current Federal tax\ndebt for 2018 of about $54,800, her state tax debt exceeding $17,700, and her incorrect statements\nmade to an investigator during her background interview could be considered for certain limited\npurposes; such as, in assessing her credibility or in evaluating the evidence offered in mitigation. \nHe cited ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004) and other Appeal Board decisions\nin support of that proposition. \n    \nWhile Applicant experienced conditions beyond her control that adversely affected her\nfinancial situation, she failed to establish that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nMitigating Condition 20(g), i.e., the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax\nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements, applies in\npart because Applicant has paid the alleged tax debts and has plans in place to address the remaining\ntax debts.  However, the timing of her efforts to resolve her tax debts is an important consideration. \nInsufficient evidence was provided to explain why she was unable to file her tax returns for 2009,\n2010, and 2014 on time or why she was unable to resolve her tax debts sooner.  Given her current\nFederal and state delinquent tax debts, she has not shown her financial problems are under control. \nShe failed to mitigate the alleged security concerns.\nDiscussion\nAlleged Errors in the Formal Findings\nApplicant argues that all of the Judge\u2019s adverse formal findings are contrary to the record\nevidence.  For example, she asserts:\nSOR \u00b6 1.b. alleges that Applicant owed a delinquent tax debt in the amount of\n$2,690.98 for tax year 2007, and that as of the date of the SOR, it remained unpaid. \nApplicant paid $2,693 to the IRS in February 2018 and an additional $26 to the IRS \n3\n\nin March 2018 satisfying her 2007 tax obligation.  The SOR was not issued until\nJanuary 18, 2019, and accordingly, Applicant did not have a delinquent debt as of the\ndate of the SOR. [Appeal Brief at 3.]\nIn that paragraph, Applicant highlights a variance between an assertion in the SOR allegation (i.e.,\nher 2007 Federal taxes \u201cremain unpaid\u201d) and the evidence presented that establishes that debt was\npaid before the SOR was issued.  This argument does not establish any harmful error. \nAn SOR is an administrative pleading and is sufficient if it places an applicant on notice of\nthe security concerns to be addressed at the hearing so that he or she can prepare a case for\nmitigation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08255 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 22, 2017).  Variances between\nSOR allegations and either the evidence or a Judge\u2019s findings of fact occur from time to time.  Such\nvariances are material only when they are so great that the SOR fails to serve as reasonable notice,\nsubjecting the applicant to unfair surprise.  Id.  In this case, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b was adequate\nto place Applicant on notice of the security concerns at issue, i.e., her failure to pay her 2007 Federal\ntaxes as required raised questions  about her reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and willingness\nto comply with rules and regulations.  \nThe existence of a variance between an assertion in an SOR allegation and the record\nevidence does not necessarily establish that an adverse formal finding regarding that allegation is\ncontrary to the record evidence.  Depending on the nature and scope of an SOR allegation, not every\nassertion in the allegation need be established for security concerns to arise from it.  Put differently,\nan adverse formal finding is not a determination that every assertion in the SOR allegation has been\nestablished but rather is a conclusion that security concerns arising from the SOR allegation have\nnot been mitigated.  From our review of the record, Applicant\u2019s assertions that each of the Judge\u2019s\nadverse formal findings is contrary to the record evidence lack merit and fail to establish any error\nthat warrants relief.  In this regard, it merits noting the Appeal Board has repeatedly stated that, even\nif an applicant paid or otherwise resolved a debt, a Judge may still consider the circumstances\nunderlying the debt as well as any previous actions or lapses to resolve the debt for what they reveal\nabout the applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 17, 2017). \nAlleged Error in Failing to Make a Formal Finding\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant notes that the Judge failed to make a formal finding regarding\nSOR \u00b6 1.l, which alleged Applicant had a delinquent state tax debt of about $17,700.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.25 provides that \u201c[t]he Administrative Judge shall make a written clearance decision in a timely\nmanner setting forth pertinent findings of fact, policies, and conclusions as to the allegations in the\nSOR . . .\u201d  This provision does not on its face authorize a Judge to enter findings and conclusions\nonly as to some of the allegations.  Rather, by its plain language it requires the Judge to address all\nof them.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-07803 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009).  While the Judge erred\nin failing to make a formal finding regarding SOR \u00b6 1.l, it was harmless error because it did not\nlikely affect on the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25,\n2013).  The Judge\u2019s ultimate decision is sustainable based on his other adverse formal findings.  \n4\n\nAlleged Errors Regarding Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in finding that Applicant admitted all of the SOR\nallegations in her Answer to the SOR.   In this regard, we note that Applicant failed to comply with\nthe requirements of the Directive in her Answer to the SOR because she did not \u201cadmit or deny each\nlisted allegation.\u201d  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.4.  In fact, she did not specifically admit or deny any\nallegation.  Instead, her lengthy answer contains arguments about the applicability of the whole-\nperson factors and each of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E and F. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant does acknowledge that her SOR Answer notes she failed to file tax\nreturns in a timely manner for several years. Appeal Brief at 5.  We also note that Applicant\u2019s SOR\nAnswer contains statements in which she admitted other key aspects of the SOR allegations.   For\nexample, her SOR Answer indicated \u201c[she] was late in paying taxes between 2007 and 2016 with\nthe exception of tax years 2010-2012 and 2014 . . .\u201d  SOR Answer at 12.  Even if the Judge may have\nerred by misinterpreting some of the statements in her SOR Answer as admissions to specific SOR\nallegations, this was a harmless error because the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a\nsecurity concern are based on other substantial evidence in the record (particularly the IRS tax\ntranscripts) or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from that evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).  \nApplicant also points out the Judge indicated in the Statement of the Case that Applicant filed\nher SOR Answer in August 2019 when she actually submitted it in March 2019.  This discrepancy\nwas also a harmless error.   \nAlleged Errors in Considering and Analyzing the Mitigating Evidence\nIn various arguments, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to consider all of the record\nevidence.  In support of this contention, she argues, for example, that the Judge failed to address in\nthe decision that she hired an attorney and tax relief agency to assist her with her tax problems, but\nthey failed to take appropriate action to assist her.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the\nAdministrative Judge considered all of the record evidence, and the appealing party has a heavy\nburden when trying to rebut that presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-07191 at 4 (App. Bd.\nMar. 25, 2004).  Moreover, a Judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record\nevidence, which would be a practical impossibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01500 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 25, 2015).  In this case, Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to establish that the Judge overlooked\nevidence.\nApplicant also contends that Judge committed errors in analyzing the mitigating evidence. \nFor, example, she asserts the Judge misapplied a prior Appeal Board decision (ISCR Case No. 15-\n06640 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) standing for the proposition that the timing of the resolution\nof financial problems is an important factor to consider in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case in\nmitigation.  She argues that prior Appeal Board decisions did not apply to her case because she\nresolved the delinquent tax debts before the SOR was issued.  This argument is not persuasive.  The\nrecord reveals that Applicant was required to disclose her tax deficiencies when she submitted her\nsecurity clearance application in December 2014.  (Government Exhibit (GE) 1).  During\n5\n\nbackground interviews in July 2016 and September 2017, investigators questioned her about those\ndeficiencies.   GE 6 and 7.  At some point (date unknown), DOHA sent her interrogatories requesting\ncopies of her IRS tax transcripts for 2006 through 2016.  In April 2018, she responded to the\ninterrogatories.  GE 5.  The IRS tax transcripts that she provided reflect that, as of early 2018, she\nowed the delinquent Federal taxes for 2007-2009, 2013, and 2015-2016 as alleged in the SOR.  Id. \nIn short, the record supports a conclusion that Applicant was well aware that her security clearance\nwas in jeopardy when she resolved some or all of her longstanding delinquent Federal tax debts in\n2018.  As we stated in ISCR Case No. 15-06640 at 4, an applicant who takes action to resolve\nfinancial problems only after being placed on notice his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the\njudgment, and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate\nthreat to his or her own interests.  The Judge\u2019s reliance on the cited Appeal Board decision was\nsustainable based on the evidence in this case.  \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant cites to a Hearing Office decision for the proposition that\npayment of debts or compliance with payment plans can mitigate alleged debts.  We give due\nconsideration to that case; however, Hearing Office decisions are neither binding on other Hearing\nOffice Judges nor on the Appeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03363 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 29,\n2018).  She also argues that the Judge \u201cdisregarded favorable case law\u201d (Appeal Brief at 9) but failed\nto identify any particular case in support of that argument.     \nMany of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  In those arguments, Applicant highlights evidence that supports the granting of a security\nclearance.  As the Appeal Board has repeatedly stated, however, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJun. 27, 2016).\nAlleged Bias\nA theme running throughout Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is that the Judge was biased against her.\nShe makes various assertions of that nature.  First, she contends that the Judge was biased against\nher from the inception of the case because he found that she admitted all of the SOR allegations in\nher SOR Answer.  She argues that purported error skewed his review of the case.  Next, she contends\nthe Judge conducted a \u201cbiased analysis\u201d of the evidence \u201cfocused solely on the timing of payments\nwithout regard for circumstances in question.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 9.  Finally, she contends that the\nJudge\u2019s overalls actions amount to an \u201cunintentional bias.\u201d Id.  She asserts:\n. . . As noted above, there are errors throughout this decision specifically including\nthe decisions being contrary to the record evidence, an unwillingness to consider\n6\n\nmitigating evidence and arguments, and a disregard for Applicant\u2019s past history of\nfinancial success coupled with a lengthy time processing a clearance without issue.\nWhen reviewing the various errors in both law and fact made by the Judge in\nthis case, we contend a reasonable, disinterested person would question the fairness\nand impartiality of the Judge.  While we concede that no error on its own would\nlikely trigger this conclusion, the record as a whole contains too many errors and too\nfew references to the mitigating evidence provided.  While we concede that there is\na strong presumption to overcome when it comes to proving the bias of a Judge, that\npresumption cannot be used to negate any and all errors raised by an Appellant.  [Id.]\nWe do not find Applicant\u2019s bias arguments persuasive.  Bias involves partiality for or against\na party, predisposition to decide a case or issue with regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack\nof impartiality.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-03974 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2006).  As Applicant\nnotes, there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  Id.  Bias is not demonstrated\nmerely because a Judge found against the appealing party.  Nor is bias demonstrated merely because\na party can show a Judge committed a factual or legal error.  The standard is not whether a party\npersonally believes a Judge was biased or prejudiced against that party.  Rather, as Applicant notes,\nthe standard to demonstrate bias is whether the record of the proceedings contains any indication that\nthe Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, disinterested person to question the\nfairness and impartiality of the Judge.  Id.  Based on our review of the record, we conclude that\nApplicant has failed to meet the heavy burden of demonstrating the Judge was biased against her.\nWe see no reason to conclude that the Judge did anything that would persuade a reasonable person\nto question his impartiality. \nConclusion\nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 17, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2,\n1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant  requested a hearing.  On February 14, 2020, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Candace Le\u2019i\nGarcia denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines J and E\nare not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised in appeal:  Applicant was\nborn in Morocco and immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-2000s.  He is single and has no dependents. \nHe has never previously held a clearance.  All of his family members live in Morocco\u2013his mother\nand six siblings are citizens and residents of that country.  He stated in his security clearance\napplication that he regularly communicates with his siblings.  At the hearing, he testified that his\nonly contact is with his mother and one sibling; however, he speaks with these two relatives daily,\nprimarily through a group chat.  He has traveled to Morocco several times, most recently in 2019. \nApplicant gave his mother money when he visited her and has done so regarding other family\nmembers as well.  He stated that no family member in Morocco relies on him for financial support. \nApplicant also has several cousins who are citizens and residents or Morocco, one of whom\nis retired from the Moroccan military.  He last contacted this cousin in 2016.  He has two other\ncousins who serve in the Moroccan military, and he has a childhood friends who is a police officer\nin Morocco.  In 2008, Applicant opened a bank account in Morocco to hold funds for a land\npurchase.  In 2018, he estimated that he had about $9,000 in the account.  In 2013, he purchased an\napartment in Morocco as a residence for his mother and intends to sell it after she passes away. \nApplicant has about $30,000 in a U.S. checking account and believes that he has a retirement\naccount in this country from previous employment.\nMorocco is an important security, trade, and development partner with the U.S.  However,\nterrorists attack tourist sites, government facilities, and the U.S. consulate.  In addition, the country\nis experiencing protests over problems with the economy, police brutality, and corruption.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Morocco pose a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation.  They also could place Applicant in a conflict of interest. \nThe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s near daily contact with his mother and a sibling.  She cited to evidence\nof his childhood friend who is a police officer and his cousin who is retired from the military.  She\n2\n\nalso stated that Applicant has some significant financial assets in Morocco.  Overall, the Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had not mitigated the Guideline B concerns raised in his SOR.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  He challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings.  For example, he asserts that his\nvisits to Morocco were principally to visit family and not friends; that he talks with his relatives only\nseveral times a week rather than daily; that he has a fairly substantial net worth in the U.S.; and that\nhis last contact with the military retiree cousin was fortuitous.  We have considered Applicant\u2019s\narguments in light of the evidence, Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions, and the official notice documents\nregarding Morocco that the Judge included in the record.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings of security concern are based upon \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might\naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2019).  Applicant has\nnot identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\nare sustainable.  \n \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  However, a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the record is not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.    See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020).\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He\nsought treatment through a program offered by his then-employer, though in 1984 he did not follow\nadvice to seek treatment, and, in 1993, he left his job rather than seek treatment.  He worked on a\nfamily farm until 2004, when he began working for the predecessor of his current employer.\nIn October 2014, Applicant voluntarily entered in-patient treatment at a hospital.  He was\nexperiencing suicidal thoughts and depression.  He told the medical staff that he had the power to\naffect storms, though he did not recall telling them that he was a prophet or had two contradictory\npersonalities.  After his discharge he received outpatient treatment but has had no treatment since\nmid-2015.  He has not had a lapse in his condition since he left the hospital.\nIn addition to his hospitalization, Applicant sought mental health treatment, electroconvulsive\ntherapy, and medication periodically over the years since 1985.  These treatments worked\ntemporarily, but when they stopped working, his symptoms returned, and he discontinued treatment. \nAt the request of the CAF, Dr. D, a psychologist, evaluated Applicant on the question of whether his\nmental health issues impugned his judgment and reliability.  Dr. D conducted the interview on line. \nApplicant felt uncomfortable, believing that he could not trust Dr. D.  In addition, he did not want\nto undergo the emotional pain of speaking about his psychological history.  Dr. D explained to\nApplicant that failure to talk about his history could have an adverse impact on his security\nclearance.\n2\n\nDr. D prepared a written evaluation of Applicant, basing his opinions on his on-line clinical\ninterview, a medical records review, and a personal assessment inventory (PAI).  He also spoke with\nApplicant\u2019s wife.  The evaluation stated that Applicant was not willing to discuss \u201ctriggers and\ncauses of his depression\u201d and would reply to questions \u201cwith statements instead of answers[.]\u201d\nDecision at 4.  The tests that Dr. D performed did not disclose current disqualifying psychological\nconditions.  He diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar Disorder in full remission.  He went on to state\nthat Applicant\u2019s failure to be candid and forthright despite the implications for his security clearance\nshowed a lack of judgment and suggests that, were Applicant\u2019s symptoms to recur, he would not\nseek treatment. Based on this resistence to treatment, Dr. D was not able to recommend that\nApplicant receive a clearance.\nIn December 2018, Applicant submitted to an evaluation by a psychiatrist, Dr. E, at the\nrequest of Applicant\u2019s attorney.  Applicant was cooperative with Dr. E due to the face-to-face nature\nof his four-hour interview.  Dr. E based his opinion on DoD records, inpatient medical records, and\na seven-page statement that Applicant prepared describing his history of psychiatric treatment.  Dr.\nE administered a PAI and interviewed Applicant\u2019s wife.  Following his examination, Dr. E\ndiagnosed Applicant with Recurrent Major Depression that had been in full remission for at least\nthree years.  Dr. E concluded that Applicant\u2019s condition did not impair his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or ability to abide by rules and regulations.  \u201cBecause of the statistical likelihood\nof a recurrence of a major depressive episode in the future, Dr. E recommended a psychiatrist\nmonitor Applicant regularly.\u201d  Decision at 6.\nDuring his testimony, Dr. E discussed statements that Applicant had made during\nhospitalization that he had hit himself with a hammer, that he was a prophet, and that he had the\npower to move storms.  He characterized these as delusional beliefs that occur in manic phases of\nBipolar Disorder.  Had Applicant reported those symptoms to Dr. E, he might have changed his\ndiagnosis to Schizoaffective Personality Disorder or Schizotypal Disorder, depending on the\npersistence of the delusions.  He stated that a claimed power to move storms was not revealed in\nApplicant\u2019s medical records or during his examination.  Dr. E concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nhospitalization evidenced an episode of agitated depression.  He opined that a peculiar belief in the\ncontext of a normal mood may not require treatment.  He stated that Applicant\u2019s wife will ensure that\nhe pursues treatment should symptoms reappear.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge cited to evidence that Applicant had received outpatient psychological treatment\nfor over thirty years, discontinuing treatment when his symptoms returned.  He noted Dr. E\u2019s opinion\nthat Applicant\u2019s condition is treatable and that he would seek treatment when his condition\nwarranted it.  He stated that both Dr. D and E believed that Applicant had no psychological\nsymptoms that would affect his ability to protect classified information.  Dr. D\u2019s negative\nrecommendation was based upon Applicant\u2019s refusal to discuss his psychiatric history, evidencing\nwhat Dr. D believed was a lack of judgment.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to\ncooperate was due to his discomfort with an evaluation conducted by means of a computer and cell\nphone.  By contrast, Dr. E conducted his evaluation in person, and the Judge found his favorable\n3\n\nconclusions to be persuasive.  The Judge stated that, based upon Applicant\u2019s candor with Dr. E and\nhis credible testimony that he will seek treatment should his symptoms recur, Applicant had\nmitigated the concerns raised in the SOR.\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable mitigation and whole-person analyses\nfailed to address significant contrary record evidence.  We find this argument to be persuasive.  We\nnote the following, drawn from the Judge\u2019s decision and the record evidence.\nApplicant has suffered from depression for many years, seeking and then discontinuing\ntreatment on his own with considerable frequency.  Decision at 3; Tr. at 51, 60, 70, 74; Applicant\nExhibit (AE) C.\nHe left a job in the early 1990s rather than seek recommended mental health treatment. \nDecision at 3.\nIn 2014, Applicant voluntarily underwent inpatient mental health treatment.  He was\nexperiencing depression and having thoughts of suicide.  During the course of his hospitalization,\nhe disclosed \u201cgrandiose delusions,\u201d stating that \u201c the power of his anger was enormous.  He literally\nwas able to control storms and tornadoes and his anger could crush this  building flat.\u201d  He expressed\na concern that he is both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and that he was not able to suppress Mr. Hyde. \nHe also advised that, on one occasion, he had become so frustrated with himself that he hit himself\nin the head with a hammer.  Decision at 3; Tr. at 62; Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 24, 57.\n4\n\nApplicant\u2019s providers diagnosed him with Bipolar Disorder.  Upon discharge he was advised\nto continue treatment by a named provider.  Applicant did so for a while but discontinued treatment\nin 2015.  He has not received mental health treatment since then.  Tr. at 70; GE 3 at 25.\nIn 2018, he spoke with a DoD recommended psychologist, Dr. D, who diagnosed Applicant\nwith Bipolar Disorder in full remission.  However, Dr. D noted Applicant\u2019s failure to answer\nquestions about his medical history candidly, which impugned his judgment.  Due to Applicant\u2019s\nfailure of cooperation, Dr. D concluded that he would not likely seek treatment should his symptoms\nreturn.  He recommended that Applicant not receive a clearance.  Decision at 3-5; GE 4. \nAfter receipt of the SOR, Applicant spoke with a psychiatrist, Dr. E, who diagnosed him with\nRecurrent Major Depression in Full Remission.  Although he concluded that there was no reason to\nbelieve that Applicant was currently lacking in judgment and reliability, he also testified that, during\na period of severe depression, judgment \u201ccan go out the window.\u201d  Moreover, he stated that there\nis a statistical likelihood that Applicant\u2019s depression will return.  He testified that Applicant had not\nmade any delusional statements to him, although if he had then his diagnosis might have been\ndifferent.  He stated that, to determine the clinical significance of Applicant\u2019s stated belief in his\npower to control the weather, he \u201cwould have had to do . . . more specific questioning about it.\u201d  Dr.\nE stated that Applicant should continue regular counseling sessions to prevent recurrence or to treat\nsymptoms that are likely to recur.  Decision at 5-6; Tr. at 87-96; AE C.\nDespite his claim that his symptoms are under control, Applicant testified at the hearing that\nhe had the power to move storms.  \n[DC]: Do you recall telling your treatment team that you had the power to control\nstorms and tornadoes?\n[Applicant]: Yes.\n[DC]: Do you believe yourself to have the power to control - -\n[Applicant]: May I explain? \n[DC]: Yes\n* * *\n[Applicant]: I don\u2019t understand why, but through my word, I have seen storms move. \nI don\u2019t understand that one.  I seriously don\u2019t, but they have . \n* * *\n[DC]: So, do you believe that you have the power to move storms? \n5\n\n[Applicant]: No, I said I had, it\u2019s not - - it\u2019s not a science, it\u2019s not like science that\u2019s\nrepeatable and predictable.  No, it\u2019s on its own occasion.  It happens and then you try\nit again, no, it does not work.  It happened once, but you can\u2019t control it, and that part\nI\u2019m grieved that I cannot better explain.  It\u2019s like I can control it now, tomorrow I\nwon\u2019t be able to, and I don\u2019t know why the difference.\n[Judge]: Again, sir, controlling what?\n[Applicant]: Move storms.\n[Judge]: Storms?\n[Applicant]: Storms, move them.\n[Judge]: Like climate-type storms?\n[Applicant]: Yes.\n[Judge]: Okay, thank you.\n[DC]: When, most recently, did you feel yourself to have moved a storm?\n[Applicant]: The most recent one, I came out of my building at the end of work day\nat [work site] and I saw the clouds starting to circle over the top of our main office\nbuilding.  I requested they move, and they did.  Tr. at 65-67.   \nIn light of the above, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s analysis failed to consider significant\naspects of Applicant\u2019s case.  Although a Judge is not expected to discuss every piece of record\nevidence, which would be virtually impossible, he or she should address evidence that a reasonable\nperson would expect to see discussed regarding a matter of national security such as a person\u2019s\naccess to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). \nMost notably, the Judge did not discuss Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony about his belief in his\npower to control the weather, limiting his analysis to the statements Applicant made during his 2014\nhospitalization.  His failure explicitly to address evidence that Applicant was, on the day of the\nhearing, articulating apparently delusional beliefs that had been found symptomatic of a serious\npsychological impairment during the course of his hospitalization diminishes the force of his\nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s problems are mitigated under the Egan standard.  Even Applicant\u2019s own\nwitness, Dr. E, stated that if Applicant had made statements like that to him during his evaluation\nit would likely have resulted in a different diagnosis, albeit not one of Bipolar Disorder.  \nRegarding Dr. D, the Judge stated that his negative recommendation had been based upon\nApplicant\u2019s refusal to cooperate rather than upon his current psychological condition.  The Judge\naccepted Applicant\u2019s explanation that he was not comfortable with an interview conducted by means\n6\n\nof electronic communications.  Of course, Applicant stated that his reticence was also a result of his\ndesire not to relive painful events from his past, which a reasonable person might find an\nunavoidable aspect of psychological counseling.  Even so, the Judge did not explain why he\ndiscounted Dr. D\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s failure to cooperate, for whatever reason, seriously\nimpugned his good judgment and whether his apparent cooperation with Dr. E, following receipt of\nhis SOR, might have been in some measure self-serving.     \nMoreover, both Drs. D and E acknowledged that Applicant may well require further mental\nhealth treatment in the future.  The Judge failed to address the substantial amount of record evidence\nthat raises skepticism about Applicant\u2019s willingness to avail himself of such treatment should his\ncondition so warrant, much less whether he would follow Dr. E\u2019s recommendation that he receive\nregular counseling during the course of his holding a clearance.  This evidence includes, among other\nthings, Applicant\u2019s many instances of stopping treatment on his own when his symptoms grew\nworse, an occurrence that a reasonable person would likely find to be a cause to continue and even\nincrease treatment rather than abandon it.\nIn summary, Applicant has experienced depressive episodes for over thirty years.  He has\nrepeatedly withdrawn from treatment, and he left a job rather than seek recommended  psychological\ncounseling.  He was hospitalized for severe depression and suicidal thoughts, expressing delusional\nideas such as his ability to control storms and flatten buildings.  He also admitted to having hit\nhimself in the head with a hammer in frustration over his emotional difficulties.  During his hearing\ntestimony, he reiterated his belief that he could control storms, which appears inconsistent with a\nconclusion that, whatever his diagnosis, his condition is in full remission.  A DoD appointed\npsychologist recommended that he not receive a clearance due to lack of cooperation during his\nevaluation.  A psychiatrist of Applicant\u2019s own choosing stated that his problems are statistically\nlikely to recur and believed that he should continue regular counseling.  However, the record\nsuggests Applicant may well decline to do so.  \nAs noted above, a favorable clearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for\ndoubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014).  In the case before us, the record discloses many reasons to\ndoubt Applicant\u2019s current judgment and reliability and to conclude that Applicant has failed to meet\nhis burden of persuasion regarding mitigation.   The Judge\u2019s analysis failed to address important\nrecord evidence and ran contrary to the weight of the evidence.  The decision is not sustainable.\n7\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.       \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July\n17, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On April 27, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that his\nfactual omissions from his security clearance applications (SCAs) and his false answers during his\nclearance interviews were deliberate and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline B are not at issue in\nthis appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has five siblings, who reside in the U.S. and are naturalized U.S. citizens.  One of\nthe siblings has been incarcerated in a U.S. prison since 2005.  In SCAs completed in 2013, 2014,\nand 2015, Applicant failed to list this sibling in the section inquiring about his relatives.  During \nsubject interviews in 2011 and 2016, Applicant did not disclose the sibling in question.  During his\n2016 interview, the investigator asked him if he had a sibling in prison, and Applicant answered in\nthe negative.  Applicant stated that he had been advised by his first employer not to list the\nimprisoned sibling, insofar as he had minimal contact with him.  He claimed that he had relied on\nthis advice when completing his SCAs.  (Applicant\u2019s appeal brief includes contact information for\nthe person he asserts advised him.  The Board is not authorized to conduct investigations nor can we\nconsider new evidence.)\nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he takes his mother to visit his incarcerated\nsibling about twice a year and that he sees the sibling on these occasions.  He also acknowledged that\nhe sometimes speaks with this sibling on the phone when the sibling calls their mother.  In his\nAnswer to the SCA, Applicant stated that he was estranged from his sibling and that it would be\nunfair for this matter to have a negative impact on his life.  He also stated that he falsely believed\nthat if he had disclosed this sibling it might have made it more difficult to obtain a clearance.  In an\nSCA completed in 2017, Applicant listed his incarcerated sibling.  He states that he has received\ncounseling regarding this matter.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s various explanations for his omissions:  that he had been\nadvised not to disclose his sibling because he had no contact with him; that, despite his purported\nlack of contact, he testified that he occasionally speaks with his sibling and visits the sibling in\nprison; and that he had been concerned that disclosure could harm his chances for a clearance. \nMoreover, she noted his 2016 interview in which he replied negatively to a question if he had a\n2\n\nsibling in prison, which she characterized as \u201ca lie.\u201d  Decision at 8.  The Judge cited to the repeated\nnature of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, concluding that his evidence was not sufficient to mitigate the\nconcerns raised in his SOR.\nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings about the deliberate nature of his omissions,\narguing that he did not intend to deceive the Government about his sibling and citing to his claim\nthat he had been previously advised to leave this person off his SCAs.  He also argues as follows:\n\u201cOn my 2016 interview, I voluntarily disclosed my [sibling\u2019s] information to the background\ninvestigator[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 1.  We examine a Judge\u2019s findings to see if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate\nto support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  See ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2019).  We note one error in the\nJudge\u2019s findings.  Government Exhibit (GE) 3 is an application for a Public Trust Position\ncompleted in 2014 rather than an SCA, as the Judge found.  This document did not request\ninformation about siblings, only parents, step parents, foster parents, children, and stepchildren.  GE\n3 at 15-16.  Applicant did not err by failing to disclose information that was not sought.  However,\nregarding the remaining allegations, the multiple nature of Applicant\u2019s omissions, along with his\ninconsistent explanations for them, support the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsifications.  The\nJudge\u2019s error regarding the 2014 application did not likely affect the overall outcome of the case. \nTherefore, it is harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020).   \nRegarding the 2016 interview, the investigator informed Applicant of evidence that Applicant\nhad a sibling in confinement.  \u201c[Applicant] stated that this is incorrect\u201d and that [none] of his\nsiblings \u201care or were in confinement.\u201d  Enhanced Subject Interview Summary at 14, included in GE\n5, Interrogatories.  In responding to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided some corrections for\nthe 2016 summary but none that made reference to his incarcerated sibling.  He certified that the\ninterview summary as corrected was accurate.  GE 5, Interrogatories, at 3-4, 6.  We find no reason\nto disturb the Judge\u2019s findings about the 2016 clearance interview.1  Except for the one error noted\nabove, the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial record evidence.    \nApplicant cites to his evidence in mitigation and to his character evidence, arguing that the\nJudge should have entered a favorable decision.  Applicant\u2019s arguments consist of nothing more than\na disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show that the\nJudge\u2019s analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581\nat 4.  Applicant states that denial of his security clearance will harm his employment and his\nfinancial stability.  The Directive does not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable\ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03024 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 9, 2020).   \n1Applicant may be arguing that his eventual disclosure his sibling\u2019s status in his 2017 SCA satisfies his burden\nof persuasion regarding mitigation.  However, under the facts of this case, we find in this argument no reason to disturb\nthe Judge\u2019s analysis of a series of knowingly false statements occurring over a period of several years.    \n3\n\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On August 31, 2020, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge David M. White\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge found against Applicant on four alleged delinquent debts and on a falsification\nallegation.  The Judge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant incurred more than $90,000 in delinquent consumer debt since\n2016, most of which remains unresolved.  He denied, and attempted to conceal, his\nfinancial issues when applying for a trustworthiness determination.  Based upon\nevaluation of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, national security eligibility to\noccupy a designated sensitive position is denied.  [Decision at 1.]\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant requests that his Notice of Appeal, which contains various\narguments, be incorporated into his brief.

These contentions lack\nmerit.  Applicant\u2019s arguments reflect that he has the mistaken impression that Department Counsel\nhad an obligation to present evidence favorable to him at the hearing.  When Applicant received the\nSOR, he was provided a copy of the Directive, which states, \u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\nthe applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to\nobtaining a favorable . . . decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Additionally, Department Counsel\u2019s\ndiscovery letter also informed Applicant that he \u201cwas responsible for providing [his] own witnesses\nand/or documents at the hearing\u201d and \u201cthe Government will not create or provide evidence for you.\u201d \nDiscovery letter of June 3, 2019, at 2-3.  At the hearing, the Judge advised Applicant that he was in\npossession of the SOR and his SOR Response and, if Applicant wanted him to consider any other\nevidence in reaching his decision, Applicant must present it during the hearing or after the hearing\nwhile the record remained open.  Tr. 15-16.  From our review of the record, Applicant has failed to\nestablish that he was misled in any manner about his responsibility to present mitigating evidence. \nHe also failed to establish that he was denied the due process afforded him under the Directive or\nthat Department Counsel engaged in any misconduct. \nApplicant contends that Judge erred in some of his findings of fact.  The purported errors\ninclude the date he was awarded an associates degree and the date he started his current job.  Even\nif the Judge made the alleged errors, they were harmless because they did not likely affect the\noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 13-01074 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2014).  Applicant\nalso argues that he did not falsify his security clearance application (SCA), claims he was not aware\nof the delinquent debts at the time he completed his SCA, and notes he incurred a head injury that\nhas affected his memory.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings and conclusions of security concern are based on substantial evidence or constitute\nreasonable inferences that could be drawn from the record.  See, e.g. ADP Case No. 15-02400 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Sep. 12, 2016).     \nApplicant asserts that the investigator conducted his background interview in an\nunprofessional manner.  The Appeal Board, however, has no authority to rule on the manner in\nwhich officials conduct trustworthiness investigations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05290 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2017).  He further contends the denial of his request for a public trust position\nwill have negative repercussions for him and his family.  On this latter point, the Directive does not\npermit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-02496 at\n3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015).\nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  Some of these arguments are based on new evidence that, as noted above, we cannot\nconsider.   None of his arguments are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in\n3\n\na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 19-02087 at 3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2020).\n    \nApplicant has not identified any harmful errors.  The Judge examined the relevant evidence\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record. \nThe standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding security clearances: such a determination \u201c. . . may be granted\nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  See, e.g., ADP Case No.\n19-02087 at 3.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 28, 2020, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings regarding the Guideline K\nallegations and one Guideline E allegation were not raised as an issue on appeal.  Consistent with\nthe following, we affirm.\nThe Judge found against Applicant on one Guideline E allegation.  This asserted Applicant\ndeliberately attempted to control his breathing in order to slow his heart rate during a polygraph\nexamination administered by a Federal agency in 2017.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted this allegation.  \nThe Judge found:\nIn the sworn statement, Applicant said, \u201cDuring the polygraph exam, I was\ntrying to control my breathing to slow my heart down.  I had held back information\nthat I later told [the examiner], and included in this statement.\u201d  (GE 3 at 2)  \nApplicant stated that he \u201cfelt I had to pass the poly exam, so [I] decided to try to\ncontrol my heart rate, which just caused me to need to breathe deeper during other\nquestions.

In his analysis, the\nJudge noted Applicant\u2019s sworn statement contradicted his hearing testimony denying that his\nattempts to control his breathing were intended to influence the outcome of the polygraph.  The\nJudge concluded that Applicant\u2019s use of countermeasures to influence the polygraph not only\nevidenced poor judgment but also a failure to cooperate with in the security clearance process.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that he did not intentionally withhold information\nduring the polygraph.  We note that the above quotes from Applicant\u2019s sworn statement\n(Government Exhibit 3) are accurate.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings\nabout Applicant\u2019s use of countermeasures to influence the results of a polygraph are based on\nsubstantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.

See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-01717 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2017).  We give due consideration to the Hearing\nOffice case that Applicant has cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor\nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nElmo Arthur Blubaugh, Personal Representative\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 3, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions), Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June\n10, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nPamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her evidentiary\nand procedural rulings, whether the Judge erred in her findings of fact, and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in his early 40s, was hired by a defense contractor, but this employment\nis  contingent on him obtaining a security clearance.  He has earned a master\u2019s degree.  He has never\nbeen married and has no children.  \nIn 2011, Applicant was terminated from a Federal Government position for engaging in \nquestionable conduct and demonstrating an inability to follow policies and procedures.  His\nquestionable conduct included tardiness, demonstrating a lack of respect for coworkers, attempting\nan unauthorized entry into a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), attempting to\nquery a unknown foreign national online for assistance with his work, bringing a prohibited USB\ndevice into a SCIF, and failing to properly report his security violation.  His security violations\nresulted in the suspension of his access to classified information prior to his termination.  He denied\nthe alleged conduct with explanations, such as, he unintentionally brought the USB device into the\nSCIF.  An examination of the device revealed it contained no classified information. \nIn 2014, Applicant was terminated from a job for failing to follow project guidelines and\nmeet requirements and deadlines.  He claims his employer instituted unreasonable timelines for\nprojects and failed to provide proper equipment.  He also claimed he was terminated shortly after\nraising workplace safety concerns.  Following his termination, he sent questionable emails to his\nformer employer, including a threat to reveal unfavorable information to the employer\u2019s client.  An\nattorney representing the former employer sent Applicant a letter telling him to \u201cimmediately cease\nand desist from any further communications\u201d and reminded him that he signed a confidentiality\nagreement.  Decision at 5. \nIn 2018, a licenced psychologist diagnosed Applicant with exhibiting signs of Paranoid\nPersonality Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder.  The\npsychologist \u201cconcluded that Applicant suffers from interfering mental health conditions that could\nhave a negative impact on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when handling classified\n2\n\ninformation or performing sensitive tasks in the future.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Applicant contends the\npsychologist\u2019s diagnosis was defective due to a lack of information and biased.  During the clinical\ninterview, Applicant reported he was wrongfully terminated from his Government position in 2011\nbecause he witnessed and reported improper activities in the workplace, including the mishandling\nof classified information, a coworker\u2019s connection to a drug cartel, deliberate espionage, and the\nframing of an innocent employee with allegations of child pornography.  Additionally, he claimed\nhe was later subjected to surveillance by defense contractor employees and became the victim of\narson in retaliation for disclosing information to the FBI and a military law enforcement agency.  The\npsychologist indicated that Applicant had a \u201cglobal mistrust and suspicion of other\u2019s motives\u201d and\nrecommended he participate in psychiatric treatment.  As of the date of the hearing, he has not\nparticipated in such treatment.  Id. \nApplicant\u2019s father testified regarding the surveillance of his home and the purported arson. \nApplicant also presented character reference letters that described him as a trusted, gifted, and \ndedicated individual. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant has a history of unreliable and inappropriate workplace behavior.  He has\ncommitted security violations.  A psychologist determined he has mental health conditions that are\nnot fully under control.  Applicant has failed to establish his questionable conduct is unlikely to\nrecur.  His psychological conditions that cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment are resolved.  \nDiscussion\nEvidentiary and Procedural Rulings\nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant requested the Judge obtain an unredacted version\nof a FBI report so that she could understand the conduct he witnessed as a Government employee\nand the harassment he later encountered.  In the decision, the Judge noted that she did not have the\nauthority to order another Federal agency to provide an unredacted copy of its investigative report. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s ruling was erroneous, stating she did not need\nto make the report public.  Applicant cites no authority supporting his contention that the Judge\ncould order another agency to produce such a report.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s ruling. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.11 provides that an applicant\u2019s discovery \u201cis limited to non-privileged documents\nand material subject to control by the DOHA.\u201d  A DOHA Judge lacks jurisdiction over another\nGovernment agency.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02208 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2019).  More\nspecifically, a DOHA Judge has no authority to order another Government agency to produce a\nunredacted copy of its investigative report.\nApplicant notes that the hearing was held less than three weeks after the issuance of the\nNotice of Hearing and argues that he was not given adequate time to arrange for critical witnesses\nto be present at the hearing and for the advice of legal counsel.  We note the record does not reflect\n3\n\nthat Applicant requested a continuance before or at the hearing for additional time to prepare his\ncase, to arrange for the availability of witnesses, or to seek the advice of legal counsel.  \u201cIf a party\nhas a meaningful opportunity to raise an objection or procedural issue with an Administrative Judge,\nbut fails to do so, then the party is not in a strong position to claim error on appeal.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR\n03-00543 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 21, 2004).  In this case, the SOR was issued on October 3, 2019,\nDepartment Counsel mailed the government exhibits (GE) to Applicant on January 30, 2020 (GE\n7), and, in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8, Applicant was provided the Notice of Hearing more\nthan 15 days before the date of the hearing, i.e., February 26, 2020.  Applicant has failed to establish\nany procedural or due process error occurred in the scheduling of the hearing.\n   \nApplicant argues the hearing was held at an \u201cextreme distance\u201d from his home, which made\nit \u201cimpossible\u201d to arrange for witnesses to testify.  Appeal Brief at 2.  This is another issue that\nApplicant failed to raise before or at the hearing.  We note the hearing was held within 150 miles of\nApplicant\u2019s residence.  The Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s prehearing guidance notifies applicants\nthat they \u201ccan expect the hearing to be held at a facility within 150 miles of their residence or place\nof employment.\u201d  See Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s Prehearing Guidance for DOHA Industrial\nSecurity Clearance (ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness (ADP) Hearings, dated January 15, 2019. \nWe find no error occurred in DOHA\u2019s or the Judge\u2019s selection of the location where the hearing was\nheld.\n  \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant requested the Judge contact specific individuals\nto obtain testimony from them.  In her decision, the Judge noted that she was not responsible to\ncontact individuals to obtain information from them and that Applicant could have provided\naffidavits and character reference letters from them but failed to do so.  The Judge also noted that\nthe burden was on an applicant to present evidence in mitigation.  Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions\nin his appeal brief, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s ruling.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, which states,\n\u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate\nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d\n  \nSubstantial Evidence\nApplicant challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  We examine disputed findings\nof fact to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20,\n2018)(quoting Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \nApplicant claims the Judge erred in finding that he \u201crefused medical treatment.\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 3.  This assertion is incorrect.  The Judge did not find that Applicant refused medical\ntreatment.  Rather, she found the psychologist recommended Applicant participate in psychiatric\ntreatment and, as of the date of the hearing, he has not participated in such treatment.  We note the\nJudge\u2019s finding is not accurate.  In his written evaluation, the psychologist noted Applicant\u2019s primary\ncare physician recommended Applicant undergo a psychiatric evaluation, which he did not do, and\n4\n\nconcluded \u201c[h]e is unlikely to seek treatment and, even if he did, his conditions will likely be life-\nlong.\u201d  GE 4 at 8.  While the Judge erred in her finding that the psychologist recommended\npsychiatric treatment, it is a harmless error because it did not likely have any affect on the outcome\nof the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge found Applicant was sexually inactive\nand a virgin.  He also argues his sexual orientation cannot be used as a basis to deny him a security\nclearance.  The Judge\u2019s finding at issue was limited to reciting the psychologist\u2019s finding that\nApplicant \u201cwas sexually inactive, which [Applicant] asserted was information that was\ninappropriately considered by the doctor.\u201d  Decision at 4.  The Judge\u2019s decision makes no reference\nto virginity or sexual orientation.  This assignment of error is unpersuasive.   \nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings that he engaged in the questionable\nconduct which led to his termination from his Government position in 2011.  For example, he asserts\nthat he never demonstrated a lack of respect to his coworkers, that the unauthorized attempt to enter\na SCIF occurred when he was a new employee who was not adequately informed of the restrictions,\nand that he never attempted to ask a foreign individual for assistance with his work.  He argues all\nthe alleged conduct leading to his 2011 termination was incorrect and baseless.  From our review of\nthe record evidence, the Judge\u2019s challenged findings were based on substantial evidence, particularly,\nGE 6, the termination memorandum that Applicant received from the Government agency.\nAlthough Applicant has styled other arguments as challenges to the Judge\u2019s findings of fact,\nthose arguments, in effect, are seeking an alternative interpretation of the evidence.  For example,\nhe contends the Judge reached conclusions based on false and incorrect evidence and argues there\nis no evidence that he engaged in misconduct.  Appeal Brief at 6.  From our overall review of the\nrecord, we concluded the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern are based\non substantial evidence or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  \nWeighing the Evidence\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant highlights that the FBI denied his request to take a polygraph. \nHe also notes the FBI informed him that they would not honor his request for them to perform a\npolygraph on him to verify his disclosures to them.  In his brief, he argues the Judge\u2019s evaluation of\nhis statements about various events are in error as a result of the FBI\u2019s denial to perform a polygraph\non him.  We find this contention baseless.  In her decision, the Judge merely made a finding that the\nFBI denied his polygraph request.  She did not draw any conclusions based on that denial.   \nMost of Applicant\u2019s arguments in his appeal brief amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  For example, he challenges reliability of the psychologist report, claiming\na clinical interview of hour and a half in length was insufficient to make a diagnosis.  He also argues\nthat his firing in 2014 was based on false grounds, that the employer made demands that far\nexceeded the initial expectations for the job, that the employer failed to provide adequate equipment\nfor him to perform the job for weeks, and that the work environment at that job was toxic.  However,\n5\n\na party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01759 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2020).  Applicant further notes that the loss of\nhis security clearance has devastated his professional career, but, as we have previously stated, the\nadverse impact of an unfavorable decision on an applicant is not a relevant consideration in\nevaluating his or her security clearance eligibility.  Id.\nConditional Security Clearance\nIn his brief, Applicant requests that he be granted a temporary security clearance so that he\ncould obtain employment, secure counsel, and obtain mental health treatment to alleviate any\nsecurity concerns.  However, we conclude that Applicant has not established that the granting of an\nexception under Appendix C of the Adjudicative Guidelines is merited.\nConclusion\nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nJanuary 9, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal\nConduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan.\n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 10, 2019, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of\nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The\nJudge found in favor of Applicant on two of four Guideline E allegations and on all of the Guideline\nJ and Guideline G allegations.  The Judge found against Applicant on a Guideline E allegation that\ncross-alleged all of the Guideline J allegations and on an allegation involving a 2018 incident \ndiscussed below.  The favorable findings have not been raised as issues on appeal.  Consistent with\nthe following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in his early 40s, retired from the military after 20 years of honorable\nservice and has worked for a defense contractor for the last four years.  He married in 2009, divorced\nin 2016, and has custody of his two children.  About a year after their divorce, his ex-wife began\nresiding with him again and continues to do so.\nApplicant admitted he has a volatile relationship with his ex-wife that predated their\nmarriage.  Between 2001 and 2014, he had criminal charges related to domestic violence brought\nagainst him on seven separate occasions.  Due to those charges, he pled guilty to harassment in 2001\nand was sentenced to a deferred sentence; pled guilty to violating a restraining order later in 2001\nand was sentenced to 24 months of probation and required to attend 36 domestic violence counseling\nsessions; and pled guilty to criminal mischief (breaking his then-wife\u2019s cell phone) in 2013 and was\nsentenced to supervised probation and domestic violence counseling.  The other charges against him\nwere dismissed.  Although criminal charges for a November 2013 incident were dismissed, the\nmilitary took action to demote Applicant because of that incident.   \n        \nBetween 2010 and 2018, approximately 37 phone calls were made to the local police\ndepartment from Applicant\u2019s residence claiming domestic violence disturbances between Applicant,\nhis ex-wife, and his children.  Several of the domestic disturbance calls referenced Applicant\u2019s use\nof alcohol, but he denied alcohol use led to any of the incidents.  In 2018, Applicant locked his ex-\nwife out of the house.  The police were called and informed him that she was considered a resident\nand he must allow her access to the property.  Applicant admitted that he and his ex-wife were both\nat fault for letting disagreements foment into larger issues that resulted in police involvement. \nAlthough he admitted engaging in the arguments and breaking the cell phone, he denied ever hitting\nor striking his ex-wife.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Analysis\nApplicant has not been arrested since 2014, which shows some amount of rehabilitation.  He\nsuccessfully completed a domestic violence group treatment in 2014.  However, Applicant\u2019s nearly\n20-year relationship with his ex-wife routinely requires police involvement and includes multiple\narrests for domestic disturbances.  The incidents are not minor and cast doubt on his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \u201c[B]ecause he continues to have disputes with [his ex-wife], who\nhe allows to reside in his home, which require police involvement, future problems and disturbances\nare likely to recur.\u201d [Decision at 7.]  Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security\nconcerns.   \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends the SOR allegations lack vital details and notes that there are often\ncontradictions in the statements of suspects and witnesses taken during criminal investigations. \nHowever, an SOR is an administrative pleading that is not held to the strict requirements of a\ncriminal indictment, and it does not have to allege every possible fact that might be relevant at the\nhearing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08255 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 22, 2017).  The SOR allegations\nat issue were sufficient to place Applicant on notice of the Guideline E security concerns.\nApplicant makes various arguments that the evidence is insufficient to prove the SOR\nallegations.  He highlights purported deficiencies in the police reports and points to matters in them\nfor support of his arguments that his ex-wife is not honest, that she misled investigators, and that her\ninjuries were likely self-inflicted.  In general, he argues the police reports lack credibility and contain\nfalse accusations.  In this regard, we note that Applicant admitted the eight Guideline J allegations. \nThese include allegations pertaining to seven incidents in which domestic violence charges were\nbrought against him between 2001 and 2014 and an allegation asserting the police were called to his\nhome for domestic disturbances at least 25 times since 2010.  Although Applicant denied the\nGuideline E allegation that cross-alleged those eight Guideline J allegations, the Judge properly\ncould have considered Applicant\u2019s admissions to all of the facts incorporated in the cross-alleged\nGuideline E allegation in determining whether it was proven.  Applicant also admitted the Guideline\nE allegation that he locked his ex-wife out of the house in 2018 and that the police informed him that\nhe must allow her access to the house as a resident.  From our review of the record, we conclude the\nJudge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern in this case are based on substantial\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g. ISCR\nCase No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).  Furthermore, we give deference to an\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  To a significant extent\nApplicant is challenging the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Given the record evidence as a\nwhole, Applicant\u2019s challenges are not persuasive.\nApplicant asserts the Judge erred in finding that 37 domestic disturbance calls were made\nfrom Applicant\u2019s residence between 2010 and 2018.  Government Exhibit 7 contains 40 police\n\ndepartment call-log sheets.  Applicant challenges 12 of the calls, noting that some involved the\nconduct of his ex-wife instead of his conduct and some do not involve any questionable conduct,\ne.g., an unintended 911 cell call or a duplicate call-log sheet.  First, we interpret the Judge\u2019s finding\nas not being limited to calls to the police department about Applicant\u2019s questionable conduct but\nrather to encompass all domestic disturbance calls originating from his residence.  Second, given the\nnumber of call log sheets in GE 7, the Judge apparently disregarded three of them in making his\nfinding.  Third, as noted above, Applicant admitted in responding to the SOR that the police were\ncalled to his home at least 25 times for domestic disturbances since 2010.  Fourth, any mistakes the\nJudge may have made regarding the number or nature of the challenged calls amount to harmless\nerror because they would not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n03727 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2019).  Applicant\u2019s challenge to the Judge\u2019s findings regarding the\npolice calls merit no relief. \n \nApplicant argues there is no explanation how the allegations could lead to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress.  He also states, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been articulated how these issues [such as,\nquestionable judgment] apply.  Articulation of credible negative conduct hasn\u2019t been articulated.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 10.  To the extent that he is arguing the conduct alleged fails to establish security\nconcerns, we do not find that argument persuasive.  The Directive presumes there is a nexus or\nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018).  Direct or objective\nevidence of nexus is not required.  Id. \nApplicant further argues that he has not been involved in intentional or accidental disclosures\nof classified information or that he failed to follow security measures.  While the absence of prior\nsecurity violations is a matter that a Judge should consider, along with all the other evidence in the\nrecord, a prior good security record does not preclude a Judge from concluding that an applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances present security concerns that he or she failed to mitigate.  The Government does not\nhave to wait until an applicant has compromised or mishandled classified information before it can\ndeny the applicant a clearance.  Even those with clean security records can encounter circumstances\nin which their judgment and reliability might be compromised.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01131\nat 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2018). \nThe balance of the Applicant\u2019s arguments advocate for an alternative weighing of the\nevidence.  He challenges, for example, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the incidents at issue from 2001\nto 2018 were not minor.  He also set forth various arguments for why his decision to let his ex-wife\nto continue to reside with him was mitigating.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence or ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun.\n27, 2016). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant has worked for her current employer since 2010 in a position that requires access to classified information. She first received a clearance in 2008, in the course of a prior employment. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleged that she used marijuana with varying frequency from 2002 to 2005 and later from 2010 to 2015, including use after having been granted access to classified information. Applicant used marijuana in college from 2002 to 2005. In her 2008 SCA and at the hearing she admitted that she used it eight times and stopped in order to improve her chances of getting a Government job or a job that required a clearance. She abstained for about five years but claimed that she accidentally ingested some marijuana at a friend\u2019s party in 2010. She admits that she resumed using marijuana in social settings and stopped in 2015. The Judge found that it was not clear how many times Applicant used marijuana between 2010 and 2015, noting that in her 2017 SCA she estimated about \u201c10 to 15 times within the last 10 years.\u201d Decision at 2.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJeffrey D. Billett, Esq.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On \nDecember 14, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 13, 2019, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Nichole L. Noel denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that\nApplicant had lied to her substance abuse counselor, whether the Judge was biased against her, and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with\nthe following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for her current employer since 2010 in a position that requires access\nto classified information.  She first received a clearance in 2008, in the course of a prior employment. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged that she used marijuana with varying frequency from 2002 to 2005 and\nlater from 2010 to 2015, including use after having been granted access to classified information.\nApplicant used marijuana in college from 2002 to 2005.  In her 2008 SCA and at the hearing\nshe admitted that she used it eight times and stopped in order to improve her chances of getting a\nGovernment job or a job that required a clearance.  She abstained for about five years but claimed\nthat she accidentally ingested some marijuana at a friend\u2019s party in 2010.  She admits that she\nresumed using marijuana in social settings and stopped in 2015.  The Judge found that it was not\nclear how many times Applicant used marijuana between 2010 and 2015, noting that in her 2017\nSCA she estimated about \u201c10 to 15 times within the last 10 years.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Applicant held\na clearance during her second period of use and worked on classified projects during that time. \nApplicant is not aware of whether her employer has a policy regarding illegal drug use and claimed\nthat she did not know that she should report illegal drug use to the security officer.\n2\n\nApplicant claims that she does not associate with friends who use marijuana.  Her hearing\nwitnesses testified as to her drug-free life style and good character.  She signed a statement of intent\nnot to use drugs in the future and has sought information about any possible drug testing program\nher employer might provide.  She has received laudatory performance reviews and awards.\nPrior to the hearing, Applicant underwent a voluntary substance abuse evaluation.  The\nclinician, a licensed clinical social worker, interviewed Applicant, performed a screening test,\nreviewed the SOR, and reviewed the Adjudicative Guidelines.  This person did not, however,\nexamine Applicant\u2019s SCAs.  During the interview, Applicant stated that she only used marijuana\nthree times between 2002 and 2005.  Concerning the use between 2010 and 2015, Applicant\ndisclosed only three instances of marijuana use, two of which she described as accidental.  The\nclinician described Applicant as remorseful and concluded that Applicant required no treatment.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge noted favorable evidence, such as Applicant\u2019s life style changes, her abstinence\nsince 2015, her work performance, and her character references.  However, the Judge concluded that\nthese matters were not sufficient to mitigate the concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s misconduct.  She\nstated specifically that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use after assuming professional responsibilities was\nintentional and that her use after receiving a clearance impugned her good judgment.  \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant was lacking in credibility.  She found that Applicant lied\nabout her drug history during the course of her substance abuse evaluation, concluding that the\ninconsistencies between the clinician\u2019s report and Applicant\u2019s statements in her SCA and at the\nhearing could not be attributed simply to faulty memory.  Rather, the Judge concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s statements to the clinician were \u201ca purposeful effort to characterize her drug use as\nreluctant and accidental.\u201d  Decision at 5.  She stated that these inconsistences are troubling because\nof the voluntary nature of Applicant\u2019s drug evaluation, which was a circumstance of her own\nmaking.  The Judge concluded that \u201c[t]he only reasonable explanation [for her false statements to\nthe clinician] is to ensure she received the desired diagnosis and prognosis.\u201d  Id.  \nDiscussion\nAllegation of Factual Error\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she lied during the course of her drug\nevaluation.  Among other things, she argues that the actual contents of the underlying interview are\nnot available, so that the Judge\u2019s findings about her disclosures to the clinician are merely\nspeculative.  She also contends that the Judge erred regarding the number of marijuana uses that\nApplicant disclosed during the evaluation.  We evaluate a Judge\u2019s findings of fact to see if they are\nsupported by substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2019).  \n3\n\nApplicant does not controvert the Judge\u2019s findings that in her 2008 SCA she admitted to\neight instances of marijuana use between 2002 and 2005; that she stopped using in order to improve\nher chances at Federal employment; and that she admitted to ten to fifteen uses of marijuana during\nthe ten years preceding her 2017 SCA.  These findings are supported by Applicant\u2019s SCA answers,\nher clearance interview, and her hearing testimony.  Government Exhibit (GE) 1, 2017 SCA, at 46;\nGE 2, 2008 SCA at 39-40; GE 3, Security Clearance Interview Summary, dated January 31, 2018,\nat 3; Tr. at 34, 39, 56, 62-63, 70.   \nAs noted, Applicant discussed her marijuana use with her clinician during the course of her\npost-hearing drug evaluation.  The evaluation report described the extent of  Applicant\u2019s marijuana\nuse as follows:\n[Applicant] reported that while a student at [college] she was exposed to a student\nbody that used marijuana to \u201cself-medicate\u201d . . . [She] reported that she did not\nreadily try marijuana.  She reported that she declined its use for some time, but peer\npressure and fellow students insisting \u201cthis was the best thing ever\u201d along with some\ncuriosity, led her to try the substance. [Applicant] reported that she tried it twice:\nboth times she took \u201ca few puffs\u201d but had no reaction to the substance at all . . . On\nthe third occasion, [Applicant] reported that she did have a reaction that was not\npleasant or comfortable.  She reported that her friends told her she had smoked \u201ctoo\nmuch,\u201d and at another social gathering she tried it again. [Applicant] reported that\nagain, the experience was \u201cnot great.\u201d  \nA period of five years ensued wherein [Applicant] did not consume marijuana . . .\n[She] reported that between 2005 and 2010 she did not engage in any consumption\nof marijuana.\nIn October 2010, [Applicant] . . . was hired by [employer] . . . She reported that she\nonce again found herself in a culture where marijuana consumption was \u201cthe norm\u201d\neven among those young professionals who held a security clearance. [Applicant]\nreported that she had friends at the time that engaged in cannabis use, to include\n\u201cedible\u201d marijuana.  \nShe reported that on two occasions she was unwittingly given foods that contained\nmarijuana.  She did not consume the products with any awareness that cannabis was\npresent and reported that in fact she had made it clear to her friend that she did not\nwant to partake of any product that contained cannabis.\n[Applicant] reported that the last time she consumed marijuana was in September\n2015 at a vacation . . . She reported that [she] took a couple of puffs, felt \u201chigh\u201d and\nwaited for the effect to end.  After that experience, [Applicant] stated that she\nstopped \u201changing out with those friends\u201d because it \u201cseemed like they always had\npot\u201d and she no longer felt comfortable with the activities they engaged in.  Applicant\nExhibit (AE) H, Drug Evaluation dated January 25, 2019, at 2-3.\n4\n\nA reasonable person would likely find significant differences between the clinician\u2019s report\nand the other record evidence referenced above.  As the Judge found, Applicant disclosed to her\nclinician only a few instances of marijuana use during the time frames at issue, two of the more\nrecent ones unknowing, in contrast to her admissions elsewhere of eight uses between 2002 and 2005\nand ten to fifteen in the decade preceding the most recent SCA.  Indeed, at the hearing, Applicant\nacknowledged that this number could possibly even be a bit higher.  Tr. at 62-63.  The report states\nthat the clinician interviewed Applicant, consulted the SOR, and conducted screening tests.  There\nis no reason to believe that this person had access to any other evidence, such as Applicant\u2019s SCAs,\nher clearance interview summary, or the substance of her hearing testimony.  Accordingly, the facts\nupon which the clinician based her evaluation appear to have come solely from Applicant.  If the\nrecital of facts contained in AE H was not complete, Applicant could have so notified the Judge. \nThe Judge erred in one respect, by finding that Applicant had disclosed to her clinician only three\nmarijuana uses in 2002 - 2005, whereas the report makes reference to four.  However, this error was\nharmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02302\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2019).  On the larger point at issue, however, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of a significant inconsistencies between the factual assertions in Applicant\u2019s SCA, clearance\ninterview, and hearing testimony on one hand and her post-hearing drug evaluation on the other are\nsustainable.  \nGiven the totality of the evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant deliberately\nminimized her misconduct in hopes of securing a favorable diagnosis is a reasonable inference from\nthe record evidence.  The contrast between the clinician\u2019s report and the other evidence is\nsufficiently great that it did not likely result simply from faulty memory or honest mistake. \nMoreover, the circumstances under which Applicant made the statements contained in the report\nwere part of an effort to obtain evidence in hopes of securing a favorable decision.  Accordingly, a\nreasonable person could conclude that Applicant deliberately minimized her misconduct in her\nstatements to the clinician in order to enhance the likelihood that the clinician would enter a\nfavorable diagnosis and, therefore, assist Applicant in meeting her burden of persuasion that she\nshould have a clearance.  We resolve this assignment of error adversely to Applicant.\nAllegation of Bias\nApplicant contends that the Judge exhibited bias against her.  She argues that the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determination, coupled with an \u201cinappropriate attack\u201d on her for submitting AE H,\nevidence a lack of impartiality.  She also cites to the Judge\u2019s reference to her \u201cclaims\u201d about\nunknowing ingestion and other aspects of her conduct, contending that the word \u201cclaims\u201d is, under\nthe facts of this case, pejorative and indicative of bias.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a\nJudge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 3 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  Adverse\nrulings alone do not demonstrate judicial bias.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd.\nNov. 8, 2017).\nWe have reviewed the evidence, paying particular attention to the manner in which the Judge\nconducted the hearing as reflected in the transcript.  We find no reason to conclude that the Judge\n5\n\nexhibited bias against Applicant.  For example, her negative credibility determination was founded \nupon substantial record evidence of Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements rather than upon\ninexplicable animus.  We have long noted that inconsistent statements can impugn a witness\u2019s\ncredibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03778 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2017).  Moreover, there is no\nerror in the Judge\u2019s having declined to extend significant weight to AE H, insofar as its conclusions\nreasonably appear to have relied upon a deliberate minimization of Applicant\u2019s security significant\nconduct.  In any event, the Judge\u2019s analysis certainly does not constitute an attack upon Applicant\nfor merely having submitted the document in the first place.  One need not resort to allegations of\njudicial bias in order to account for adverse findings and conclusions that are consistent with the\nevidence viewed as a totality.  Finally, we find nothing significant in the Judge\u2019s use of the word\n\u201cclaims\u201d to describe some of Applicant\u2019s testimony.  There is nothing in the record or in the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis that would likely persuade a reasonable person that she lacked the requisite impartiality. \nApplicant has failed to meet her heavy burden of persuasion on this issue.      \n  \nIn summary, the Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant used marijuana eight times\nfrom 2002 until 2005; that she ceased using marijuana in order to enhance her chances for\nemployment; that she resumed smoking marijuana in 2010 after having been granted a security\nclearance, using it ten to fifteen times until 2015; and that she made significantly inconsistent\nstatements about her misconduct, to the detriment of her credibility.  The record supports a\nconclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nthe decision.  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is\nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl.\n2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED. \nSee Separate Opinion                  \nMichael Y.

Duffy                   \nJames F. Duffy\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSeparate Opinion of Administrative Judge Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan\nI concur in the disposition of the case.  However, I am concerned about the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant lied during her substance abuse evaluation.  \nDiscrepancies between an Applicant\u2019s statements of record and a third party\u2019s out of court\nrecitation of Applicant\u2019s non-record statement are worthy of note and would likely detract from any\nbeneficial weight from the recitation.  It is certainly possible that such discrepancies resulted from\ndeliberate dishonesty by Applicant.  However, there are also several other explanations that might\nbe at issue in case such as this:  The Social Worker may have erred either in listening, recording or\nregurgitating Applicant\u2019s description of her history. The dialogue between Applicant and the Social\nWorker might have resulted in a misunderstanding between them.  Applicant might have made\ninconsistent statement without malicious intent. The Social Worker might have minimized\nApplicant\u2019s drug usage as a mistaken effort to help her.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant lied\nin an out of court situation in order to influence the DOHA proceeding might be correct but I think\nit would have been more prudent to observe the (relatively minor) discrepancies and adjust the\nweight attendant to the substance abuse evaluation accordingly.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Mason denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn June 3, 2020, we remanded the case to the Judge on a due process issue.  In her first\nappeal, Applicant noted that she was advised in the File of Relevant Material (FORM) that she could\nobject to the admission of her interview summary into evidence.  In our first decision, we concluded\nthe Judge erred by considering Applicant\u2019s interview summary over her objection and instructed the\nJudge to issue a new decision in which he did not rely on information contained in the interview\nsummary.  \nIn his Remand Decision, the Judge made the following evidentiary ruling:\nIn compliance with the Appeal Board\u2019s decision, I will decide this case\nwithout relying on Item 4 (two interview summaries, January and March 2018).  Item\n4 will be used for explaining Applicant\u2019s employment and medical history, and her\nplan to repay the delinquent creditors.  [Decision at 2.]\nThe Judge also stated that he intends to \u201cbase\u2019 his decision in part on \u201cItem 4 (employment and\nmedical history and her approach for paying the smaller debts before the larger ones)[.]\u201d   Id.   We\ndo not understand how the Judge used or based his decision on Item 4 without relying on it.\nIn her second appeal, Applicant again raises the issue of the Judge\u2019s consideration of Item\n4.  She states:\nThe language use by the investigator in the FORM [she apparently is referring to her\ninterview summary] lends itself to indicate to the reader that I am somehow\nincompetent and that could not be further from the truth, so in my previous appeal\nI stated in the very first paragraph that I object to have the applicable parts of the\nFORM [interview summary] from being entered into evidence.  Yet, again, in the\nremand, the judge attests otherwise.  It is clear for one to see the harmful effects of\nhaving such aggressive and inflammatory remarks sewn into charges against you, it\nis impossible to unsee those accounts and proceed objectively.  [Appeal Brief at 2-3.] \nApplicant\u2019s interview summaries were part of a DoD personnel background report of\ninvestigation (ROI).  Without appropriate authentication, all or portions of an ROI cannot be\nadmitted into evidence over an applicant\u2019s objection.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.  On remand, the Judge\nerred in considering information in Item 4 over Applicant\u2019s objection.  We are unable to conclude\n2\n\nthis was a harmless error.  More specifically, we are unable to discern exactly what information the\nJudge considered in Item 4 and what impact that information may have had in his Remand Decision. \n \nAs we have previously stated, public confidence in the fairness and integrity of a national\nsecurity eligibility determination depends, to a large degree, on there being both the substance and\nthe appearance of fairness and impartial in DOHA adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-23979\nat 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2004).  A Judge\u2019s continued consideration of inadmissible evidence in a\nRemand Decision contrary to the Appeal Board\u2019s instruction could cause a reasonable person to\nquestion his or her impartiality.  \nGiven the above circumstances, we conclude the best course of action is to remand this case\nfor assignment to a new Judge for issuance a decision consistent with the requirements of the\nDirective.\nOrder\nThe Decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan             \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

On June\n26, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn August 25, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Finding of Fact\nApplicant is seeking a security clearance as a self-employed consultant.  Over the past 20\nyears, he has held a variety of security clearance and public trust positions. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file timely his 2008-2012 and 2014 Federal income\ntax returns, and he accumulated over $51,000 in past-due Federal tax debt for 2010 and 2011.  In\nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted those allegations.  The SOR also contained state tax debt\nallegations that Department Counsel withdrew at the hearing.  \nApplicant attributed his tax problems to an injury he received while traveling overseas in\n2009. This injury resulted in significant surgery and rehabilitation.  He claimed the injury left him\nunable to work and unemployed.  He returned to work in late 2011 as a self-employed consultant. \nWhile unemployed in 2009, Applicant made premature withdrawals for a retirement account to pay\nfor living expenses without being fully aware of the tax consequences of that action.  This\nwithdrawal resulted in significant, unanticipated tax liability.  The IRS filed a substitute tax return\nfor him in late 2011.  Applicant filed his 2009 Federal income tax return in July 2012.  Applicant\nmade some payments towards this debt and had subsequent tax refunds applied towards its payment. \nIn late 2013, Applicant hired a tax resolution service, which was unsuccessful in reaching\nan offer in compromise with the IRS.  His delinquent tax returns were filed, and he timely filed his\n2013 and 2015-2016 income tax returns.  For unclear reasons, he was late in filing his 2014 tax\nreturn. \nIn late 2017, Applicant hired a tax attorney who was also unsuccessful in reaching an offer\nin compromise.  In May 2019, Applicant increased his Federal tax withholdings \u201cwith an eye to\nhaving it seized and applied to his remaining 2010 balance.\u201d  Decision at 3.  In October 2019, he\nmade a lump-sum payment to resolve his 2011 tax liability.  In November 2019, he entered into a\nrepayment agreement with the IRS with initial monthly payments of $450 that increase after one year\nto monthly payments of over $1,300.  The tax attorney also indicated that Applicant planned to\n2\n\nobtain a home equity loan to make a lump-sum payment of $50,000 to resolve the 2010 tax liability. \nIt is unknown whether Applicant has followed through with this plan.\nApplicant \u201cprovided no work or character references[.]\u201d Decision at 3.  He also provided no\nbudget or documentation of financial counseling.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nNone of the mitigating conditions were met.  Applicant\u2019s tax problems are multiple, recent,\nand ongoing.  His injury, subsequent surgery and rehabilitation, and unemployment provide some\nexplanation for his failure to file his 2008 and 2009 income tax returns but do not demonstrate that\nhis indebtedness and tax filing deficiencies were due to circumstances beyond his control.  Even if\nthe stated reasons justified the delay, it is clear that he has not acted responsibly in addressing his\ntax problems.  Paying delinquent taxes by having subsequent tax refunds seized is not a repayment\nplan.  Although Applicant obtained professional assistance, it was not entirely effective.    \nApplicant has not received credit or financial counseling.  He failed to demonstrate that he\nhas made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.  His recent repayment agreement with the IRS only\nindicates that his tax issues may be resolved at some point in the future and does not establish any\nrecord of payments. \u201cThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns.\u201d  Decision at 4.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends \u201cthe Administrative Judge did not address the fact that\n[Applicant] does not fall under any of the expressed concerns stated in Guideline F\u201d and \u201c[t]he\nAdministrative Judge also failed to recognize that none of the specific concerns listed in Guideline\nF are applicable . . . .\u201d Appeal Brief at 1 and 6.  This assertion of error merits no relief.  In his\nanalysis, the Judge specifically concluded that \u201c[t]he Government established a case of\ndisqualification under Guideline F\u201d and, at the end of that paragraph, listed four disqualifying\nconditions (Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f)) in a footnote.  Decision at\n4.  While the Judge did not explicitly state those disqualifying conditions applied in this case, his\nreference to them made it sufficiently clear he was relying on them to conclude \u201ca case of\ndisqualification\u201d was established.  Decision at 4.  Of note, even Applicant\u2019s Counsel acknowledged\nin his brief that the Judge applied those disqualifying conditions when he stated, \u201c[t]he\nAdministrative Judge mentioned in footnote 3, and ultimately relied upon, four of these conditions\nin his ruling.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 5. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel argues the Judge failed to account for mitigating factors and mis-\nanalyzed the evidence.  Much of the appeal brief is a challenge to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that none\nof the mitigating conditions were met.  In making those arguments, Applicant\u2019s Counsel highlights\nevidence that supports application of certain mitigating conditions and contends the Judge\u2019s analysis\nwas unfair and unreasonable.  Even if Applicant is entitled to some credit in mitigation, any error\nin the Judge\u2019s analysis is harmless.   The mitigating evidence was not sufficient to compel a\n3\n\nfavorable decision.  A Judge is not required to conclude that a mitigation condition merits full\napplication because some evidence exists to support it.  In essence, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s arguments\namount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  As we have previously stated,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020).  Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s Counsel arguments that the\nJudge ignored evidence are not sufficient to rebut the presumption the Judge considered all of the\nrecord evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020).   \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel asserts the Judge cited \u201cnon-binding precedent\u201d in support of his\nanalysis of Applicant\u2019s tax filing deficiencies.  Appeal Brief at 6.  This argument lacks merit.  In the\ndecision, the Judge only cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988)) and Appeal Board decisions.  The cited decisions were binding precedent on the\nJudge.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-16516 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 26, 2004)(an Administrative Judge\nmust follow an Appeal Board decision even if he or she disagrees with it).\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s \u201cassertion\u201d that there was \u201cno . . . character\nevidence\u201d and notes that a witness testified at the hearing about Applicant\u2019s character.  Appeal Brief\nat 8.  In examining this issue, it first merits noting we do not consider individual words, phrases, or\nsentences in isolation when reviewing a Judge\u2019s decision.  Rather, we consider them in light of the\ndecision in its entirety.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02181 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2019).  To\nunderstand the challenged assertion, more context is needed. The Judge found that Applicant\n\u201cprovided no work or character references\u201d and later concluded Applicant \u201csubmitted no work or\ncharacter evidence which might support a whole-person assessment to overcome the security\nconcerns raised by his conduct.\u201d  Decision at 3 and 6.  We recognize that the quoted conclusion may\nbe read to indicate the Judge considered character evidence but found it insufficient to support a\nfavorable whole-person assessment.  On the other hand, given that Applicant presented a character\nwitness at the hearing (Tr. at 48-56), the quoted finding that Applicant presented \u201cno . . . character\nreferences\u201d was either wrong or, at best, unclear and confusing.  If the Judge was trying to make a\ndistinction between \u201ccharacter references\u201d and other forms of  \u201ccharacter evidence,\u201d he erred by\nfailing to do so in a clear and understandable manner.  From our review of the entire record, we\nconclude this error, whatever the underlying reason for its occurrence, was harmless because the\ncharacter witness\u2019s testimony did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n18-02239 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also claims the Judge failed to conduct a whole-person assessment.  We\nfind no merit in this assertion.  As reflected in the quoted conclusion in the prior paragraph, the\nJudge indicated he conducted a whole-person assessment.  Morever, the Judge noted that the\ndecision was based on all of the record evidence.     \n4\n\nIn his brief, Applicant Counsel raises the issue of whether the Judge was biased.  He contends\nthe Judge conducted a \u201cbiased\u201d analysis and \u201cdemonstrated clear bias, even disdain, toward\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s evidence.  Appeal Brief at 4 and 7.  Bias involves partiality for or against a party,\npredisposition to decide a case or issue with regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack of\nimpartiality.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01306 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).  Bias is not\ndemonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached unfavorable conclusions. \nOur review of the record reveals nothing that would persuade a reasonable person that the Judge\nlacked the requisite impartiality.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has not met the heavy burden of persuasion\nto rebut the presumption that the Judge was impartial.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01513 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jun. 15, 2020).  \n \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Egan at 528.  See also\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national\nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan         \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Consistent with the following,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to 2007, which he attributed to a\ndivorce.  He stated that his SOR debts resulted from poor financial decisions, such as buying an\nexpensive car in 2014 and spending money on his girlfriend.  He also explained that a period of\nreduced income and expenses associated with his mother\u2019s death affected his financial condition. \nHis delinquencies include back taxes for 2017 and an unnamed tax year, totaling about $2,400.  His\nother past-due debts include consumer debts, mortgage payments, a medical debt, student loans, and\na car loan.  He demonstrated resolution of the student loan.  However, he did not provide\ndocumentary evidence that he had resolved, or that he did not owe, any of the other debts alleged in\nthe SOR.\nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. \nAlthough Applicant experienced some circumstances that were beyond his control, he failed to\npresent documentary evidence that he had attempted to pay or settle any debts beyond his student\nloan.  He has not received financial counseling, and there is no documentary evidence that he has\nmade arrangements to pay his delinquent taxes or other debts.\nDiscussion\nApplicant states that his financial problems did not prevent a favorable clearance adjudication\nin 2007 and that his circumstances are no different today than they were then. The government is not\nestopped from making an adverse clearance determination despite prior favorable adjudications.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01680 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2019).  This is especially true in cases, such\nas this, in which the adverse decision is based on concerns that have persisted since the earlier\ndetermination.  Applicant\u2019s argument is not enough to show that the decision of the Judge was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not advise him that he wanted to see documentary\nevidence regarding all of his debts, rather than simply evidence about his taxes, student loans, and\ncharacter references.  He states that if he had understood what the Judge needed, he could have\n2\n\nprovided additional information.  At the beginning of  the hearing, Applicant offered no documentary\nevidence but stated that he would like to keep the hearing open because he was awaiting information\nfrom the IRS.  Tr. at 8-9.  During the course of the hearing, Applicant testified about all of his SOR\ndebts, offering no corroboration for his claimed efforts at resolving them.  At the end, the Judge\nadvised that he would give Applicant an additional 60 days to provide evidence about payment plans\nfor his tax obligations.  He also stated the following to Applicant: \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you.  What\nyou\u2019ve done so far is just not enough . . .  you should have been doing this [all] along before now,\nbut in those 60 days, if you can take care of some of these things and document it, then send it to us,\nokay?\u201d  Tr. at 43-44.   \nIt is axiomatic that a Judge has no authority to promise an applicant a clearance or to advise\nan applicant on the quantum of evidence that would mitigate the concerns in his or her case.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 16-00420 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2017).  Considering the record as a whole, we\nconclude that Judge did not contravene this principle by suggesting that all Applicant needed do to\nmeet his burden of persuasion was submit such documents as he eventually provided after the close\nof the record.  We note, for example, that the Judge made no reference at all to character letters, \nApplicant\u2019s inclusion of which in his post-hearing submission suggests that he understood that he\ncould provide information beyond his IRS debts.  In addition, the Judge\u2019s admonition as well as\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s closing argument, which cited to a total lack of corroboration for Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony about his effort at debt resolution, should have placed a retired E-7 from the U.S. military\nand college graduate on notice that such evidence could enhance his presentation.   Tr. at 48.  It is\nreasonable for a Judge to consider the extent to which an applicant has not corroborated his claims\nof debt resolution.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01193 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 22, 2019).  We conclude\nthat the Judge did not engender a false expectation in Applicant that his case in mitigation would be\nsufficient if he provided the documents addressed in his Appeal Brief or that he otherwise dissuaded\nApplicant from presenting available evidence.\nApplicant contends that the Judge was biased against him.  He argues that consideration of\n\u201cobjectionable exhibits\u201d regarding his 2007 clearance adjudication unfairly prejudiced the Judge\nagainst him.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party\nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No.\n16-04112 at 3 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  In this case, the Judge admitted Applicant\u2019s 2007 SCA and\na credit report from that year.  Government Exhibits 2 and 4.  Although he characterizes them as\nobjectionable, Applicant did not object to their admission at the time. Tr. at 12-14.  Evidence of a\nhistory of financial problems that extend for over a decade was relevant to an evaluation of\nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation, as well as to a whole-person analysis.  There is nothing to suggest\nthat the Judge was unduly influenced by these exhibits, which he did not mention explicitly in the\nAnalysis portion of the Decision.  Decision at 5-7.  A reasonable person would not likely conclude\nthat the Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.  He cites, among\nother things, to his military service, clean disciplinary record, character letters, and his having held\na clearance for years without a security incident.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of the\nevidence in the record, and Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to rebut that presumption.  See,\n3\n\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01482 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019).  Given the record before him, we\nconclude that Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complied with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in\nthat the Judge considered the totality of the evidence in reaching  his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 15-03592 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2017). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

On\nDecember 19, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn November 7, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge failed to evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s case in light of the totality of the record evidence, thereby rendering a decision which\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is a retired E-7 from the U.S. military.  He has attended college but does not have\na degree.  He worked in the Federal civil service beginning the year after his military retirement and\nhas worked for a Defense contractor since 2016.  He has held a security clearance for 30 years.\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges that he did not file his Federal income tax returns in a timely\nmanner for tax years 2010 and 2016.  Regarding the first  instance, Applicant was deployed overseas. \nHe had expected his son to file in his own right, so that Applicant would not claim him as a\ndependent.  However, his son ultimately did not file a return, and Applicant did not file his own.  In\n2016, Applicant used tax preparation software to complete his return.  He thought he had submitted\nit on time, but he received notification the IRS had not accepted the return.  In addition, Applicant\ndid not file his 2017 return in a timely fashion.  This instance was not alleged in the SOR.  Applicant\nfiled his delinquent returns in 2019, admitting that receipt of the SOR spurred him to do so.\nApplicant stated that he had intended to file his 2010 return on the following year but could\nnot find all of the necessary paperwork.  He stated that submission of his 2016 return was made\ndifficult by the fact that he and his wife were living in different states as well as by data errors that\nhe committed when using the tax software.  Applicant stated that he had intended to file his 2016\nreturn in 2017 but did not do so.  He attributed his failures in 2010 and 2016 to laziness.\nApplicant has acknowledged errors in judgment and now has a greater understanding of the\nimportance of filing a return on time.  He was remorseful and testified that he would not let it happen\nagain.  All of Applicant\u2019s returns from 2012 through 2015 and his return for 2018 have been in a \ntimely fashion.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s 2017 late return was not alleged.  He stated that\nhe would consider it as part of his mitigation analysis.  He concluded that Applicant had acted\nirresponsibly in regard to his delinquent tax returns, stating that his having filed them only after\nreceipt of the SOR suggested that he might be unwilling to follow rules and regulations when his\n2\n\npersonal interests are not at stake.  He stated that, although they are now resolved, Applicant\u2019s tax\nproblems are recent and not isolated.  In the whole-person analysis, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s\nmany years of service to the U.S. while holding a security clearance.  Nevertheless, the Judge\nconcluded that the favorable evidence in the record was not enough to overcome what he termed a\npattern of irresponsibility with respect to the timely filing of income tax returns.\nDiscussion\nApplicant argues that the Judge did not consider the record evidence as a totality.  He cites\nto Applicant\u2019s testimony that his 2010 return had actually been prepared for submission before his\nson\u2019s decision not to file his own return, and he cites to his many years of service, during which time\nhe held a security clearance, thereby evidencing a history of following rules and regulations. \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis failed to consider all of the relevant factors raised by\nthe SOR allegations.  \nWe do not find Applicant\u2019s arguments to be persuasive.  The Judge made detailed findings\nabout Applicant\u2019s circumstances and addressed much of what Applicant has cited in the analysis. \nA Judge cannot be expected to discuss every piece of record evidence, which would be virtually\nimpossible.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 30, 2018).  The gravamen of\nhis analysis was Applicant\u2019s having failed to file income tax returns until after receipt of the SOR,\ndespite his awareness of the delinquencies.  As we have noted in the past, a person who begins to\naddress financial problems only after his eligibility for a clearance has been called into question may\nbe less likely to follow rules and regulations when his personal interests are not at stake.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in\nthe record, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01482 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019). \nDespite Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal, we conclude that the Judge complied with the\nrequirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in that he considered the totality of the evidence in reaching his\ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03592 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2017).\n \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has worked for a Defense contractor since mid-2017.  This is his first application\nfor a security clearance.  His SOR alleges that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2015,\nthat he failed to file Federal income tax returns for 2013 through 2017, that he owes the IRS nearly\n$8,000 in taxes for 2011, and that the IRS secured a tax lien against him in 2013 for nearly $35,000. \nPrior to 2013, Applicant and his wife were financially stable.

During the time of greater financial stress,\nthe wife overspent and let the family finances \u201c\u2018get ahead of us.\u2019\u201d  Decision at 2, quoting from Tr.\nat 72.  \nBetween 2009 and 2011, Applicant worked in a different state.  In 2015, the IRS notified him\nthat his employer had not withheld sufficient amounts from his pay and that he owed nearly $35,000\nin back taxes.  This amount was included in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  The IRS\nsubsequently recalculated this debt, reducing it to about $8,000.  Applicant entered into a payment\nagreement in January 2014, and as of July 2019 the balance owed on this debt was about $4,500. \nThe IRS applied a portion of Applicant\u2019s tax refund to this debt, and it is now satisfied.\nApplicant and his wife did not file their income tax returns in a timely fashion for tax years\n2013 through 2017.  Applicant\u2019s wife was under the misapprehension that she had three years in\nwhich to file returns if they were owed a refund.  In addition, she made an erroneous entry to a\ncomputer based tax program and had to manually complete the tax forms, which she put off doing. \nSince then all tax returns have been filed, and Applicant has no outstanding tax obligations. \nApplicant and his wife now share responsibility for managing the household finances.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n2\n\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s problems resulted from circumstances outside his\ncontrol, specifically that he had become the sole provider for his family and that his wife mishandled\nher responsibilities as household financial manager. She further concluded that Applicant had acted\nresponsibly by seeking legal advice and filing for bankruptcy.  She reiterated her finding that\nApplicant\u2019s outstanding tax obligations had been resolved.  The Judge stated that Applicant had not\nbeen aware that his wife had failed to file their tax returns for 2013 through 2017 but that, after he\ndid become aware, he ensured that all the returns were filed.  \n Discussion\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge failed to consider significant evidence that runs\ncontrary to her favorable conclusions.  Department Counsel cites to evidence that undercuts\nApplicant\u2019s claim not to have been aware of his wife\u2019s late tax filings until after 2017.  She also\nargues that the Judge failed to consider evidence that impugns Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. \nWe find Department Counsel\u2019s arguments to be persuasive. \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nThe concern addressed in Guideline F is that financial problems \u201cmay indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 18.  This is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly compromise\nclassified information in order to raise money to satisfy delinquent debts.  It also encompasses the\nrisk that applicants who are financially irresponsible might also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or\nnegligent in the handling and safeguarding of classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-\n04112 at 3-4 (May 28, 2019).  Failure to file and pay taxes falls within the scope of Guideline F. \nSuch failure suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established rules and\nregulations.  Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting classified\n3\n\ninformation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).  See also ISCR Case\nNo. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016). \nThe evidence is not controverted that Applicant neglected to file his Federal income tax\nreturns as required for 2013 through 2017.  The question before the Judge was whether this failure\nimpugned his judgment, reliability, and other qualities necessary to holding a clearance.  The Judge\nfound in Applicant\u2019s favor on the ground that his wife rather than he was responsible for handling\nthe household finances, including filing tax returns.  She stated that after Applicant became aware\nof this failure, he saw to it that the returns were filed.  The gravamen of this issue is when Applicant\nknew or reasonably should have known that the returns were not filed.  Contrary to the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis, the file contains evidence that should have placed Applicant on notice that the returns had\nnot been filed long before 2018, the year the unfiled 2017 taxes would have been due.  For example,\nApplicant Exhibit (AE) B, an IRS tax transcript for tax year 2013, states that in November of 2014\nApplicant was sent an inquiry regarding the non-filing of his return for the previous year.  The\ninquiry was followed by a Notice in December 2014.  Such a notice in an of itself should have made\nApplicant aware that his wife was not discharging the couple\u2019s obligation to comply with tax laws,\nyet there is no evidence that Applicant did anything to address this deficiency at that point.\nMoreover, in February 2017, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the Security Clearance Application (SCA)\nquestion on taxes: In the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other\ntaxes when required by law or ordinance. \nIn addition, Government Exhibit (GE) 4, Applicant\u2019s 2015 bankruptcy filing, discloses that\ntax was not assessed for 2013 due to lack of a return and that the return for 2014 was not filed as\nwell.  GE 4 at 58.  Applicant signed the bankruptcy petition certifying under penalty of perjury the\ninformation in it was true and accurate.  Again, we note the discrepancy with Applicant\u2019s SCA.\nWhile the bankruptcy petition was prepared by an attorney, the contents of a document prepared and\nsubmitted to a court on Applicant\u2019s behalf, asserting the nature of his finances, is fairly attributable\nto him.  Even if Applicant were actually unaware of the true state of his taxes, this ignorance was\nnot reasonable and impugns his judgment.  Finally, a reasonable person might note that even if tax\nreturns are prepared by one\u2019s spouse, returns filed jointly, as those in question eventually were,\nwould require the signature of both spouses.  A person with an appropriate degree of concern for\ncomplying with laws and regulations might be expected to have noticed that he had not signed an\nincome tax return for at least five years.  All in all, the record contains evidence that Applicant knew\nor reasonably should have known that his tax returns had not been filed.  The Judge did not address\nthis contrary evidence in her decision, which, under the circumstances, was erroneous.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred by not addressing the inherent\nunreasonableness of Applicant\u2019s total reliance upon his wife to file returns and manage finances\nwithout devoting attention to whether she was properly handling their affairs.  She cites to ISCR\nCase No. 13-00786 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2014), in which an applicant claimed that he was unaware\nof his debts because his wife handled the family budget.  In affirming the denial of a clearance to this\napplicant, we stated the following:\n4\n\nEvidence that [the applicant] never looked at a credit report, never inquired about the\npossible impact of his wife\u2019s business practices on their finances even after learning\nof the delinquent mortgage payments for their residence, and did not know anything\nabout numerous delinquent debts in his own name until confronted with them by a\nclearance investigator are sufficient to prompt skepticism in a reasonable mind about\n[the applicant\u2019s] attention to detail regarding important matters.  Id. at 3.   \nWe conclude that the reasoning underlying our holding in the cited case is pertinent to Applicant\u2019s\nsituation as well.  The degree of ignorance claimed by Applicant suggests an indifference to the\nproper satisfaction of legal obligations that draws into question his willingness or capacity to comply\nwith the sometimes complex rules governing the handling and safeguarding of classified\ninformation.  Reliance upon a spouse or upon some other person to fulfill one\u2019s legal obligations\nplaces responsibility on an applicant to remain aware of the extent to which the spouse or other\nperson is acting reliably on his or her behalf.  Indeed, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s spouse\nattempted to file returns using a computer program but made errors requiring her to file the returns\nmanually, a task that overwhelmed her.  This is not a minor matter but one that would entail\nsignificant legal and financial impacts.  The record does not provide a clear explanation as to why\nApplicant would not have been aware of a problem like this and taken steps to file the returns\nhimself.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) regarding the security\nsignificance of an applicant\u2019s ongoing indifference to legal obligations.        \nFinally, we note that GE 4 at 32 lists a $6,000 property loss in 2014 due to the fact that\n\u201cDebtor\u2019s wife has a gambling addiction.\u201d  Again, an applicant who entrusts serious financial\nresponsibilities to a spouse with an addiction to gambling and who apparently exercises little to no\noversight of her conduct can fairly be described as indifferent to his financial obligations.  Although\na Judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence in a file, he or she cannot\nignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person could expect\nto be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903\nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).  In the case before us, Applicant\u2019s reliance upon his wife to file and\npay taxes and his apparent indifference as to whether she was actually complying with the couple\u2019s\nlegal obligations is a matter that seriously detracts from his effort to establish mitigation.  The\nJudge\u2019s failure to have analyzed this aspect of the case significantly undermines her favorable\ndecision.\nWe also note Department Counsel\u2019s argument that there is record evidence undermining the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has at last taken charge of his tax problems.  For example, it is\nclear from the record that the delinquent returns were completely filed no earlier than June 2019. \nHowever, in his Answer to the SOR, signed in March 2019, Applicant asserted that all returns had\nbeen filed by that date, which was clearly not the case.  Additionally, he testified at the hearing that\nto the best of his knowledge he had paid all of his tax obligations, although it was pointed out to him\nthat there was still a remainder of about $4,500.  Tr. at 27.  He stated that an expected tax refund\nwould be applied to this remainder, although, as Department Counsel notes, there is no evidence in\nthe record that this has in fact been done.  In any event, the extent to which Applicant failed to make\npayments on several IRS payment plans undercuts a conclusion that he has consistently shown\n5\n\nresponsible action in regard to his debts.  Finally, we note Applicant\u2019s testimony and the Judge\u2019s\nfinding that the inclusion of his wife\u2019s cousin into the household, along with his wife\u2019s going back\nto school and mortgage payments, were at the root of his security-significant circumstances.  Tr. at\n22.  The summary of his clearance interview, however, attributed Applicant\u2019s financial problems to\n\u201clay off from employer . . . too many bills, and states to have mismanaged finances.\u201d  GE 2, Answers\nto Interrogatories, at 8.  Applicant adopted this summary as an accurate reflection of his answers to\nthe interviewer\u2019s questions (Id. at 4), raising a reasonable inference that his explanations for his\nproblems have not been totally consistent.  These matters detract significantly from a conclusion that\nApplicant has finally achieved a reasonable understanding of his finances and that he is in control\nof the situation.\nTo sum up, Applicant failed to file his tax returns from 2013 through 2017, incurred a debt\nfor delinquent back taxes, neglected to ensure that his wife was actually discharging the financial\nresponsibilities that he entrusted her with to an extent that impugns his judgment, and has still not\npresented substantial evidence that he understands the root of his problems or that he has ensured\nthat they will not return.  He also made apparently inconsistent statements about the origin of his\nfinancial and tax difficulties.  The Judge\u2019s decision ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence\nand failed to consider important aspects of the case.  We conclude that, under any fair reading of the\nrecord Applicant\u2019s mitigation evidence was not sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion under the\nEgan standard.\n6\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.   \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 15, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nNovember 5, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\ncontained errors and whether his adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: Applicant\nworks for a Defense contractor.  He is married and has no children.  In 2014, Applicant submitted\na security clearance application (SCA) in which he admitted that he had smoked marijuana three\ntimes between mid-2004 and early 2014.  During the interview that was conducted later in 2014, he\nadmitted his marijuana use, advising that he did so in 2002 and 2004 and again in 2014.  He\ndisclosed that, in 2014, a woman asked him if he knew anyone who sold marijuana, and Applicant\nreplied that he did.  They drove to the seller\u2019s home, where Applicant made the purchase.  Applicant\nstated that he smoked the marijuana to impress the woman but that it had no effect upon him.\nApplicant submitted another SCA in mid-2017.  In this one, he denied having illegally used\nany drugs or controlled substances, and he denied having been involved in the purchase of illegal\ndrugs.  During his 2018 interview, he stated that he was not sure the substance he purchased was\nmarijuana because it was not tested in a lab.  In subsequent interrogatories, Applicant contended that\nthere was no reason to believe that he had purchased and used marijuana in 2014 because there are\nno police reports, drug test results, etc.  He stated that he had naively believed the substance that he\nbought and used was marijuana, but, without confirmatory tests, he could not be sure.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he had conducted research on government websites,\nwhich described the effects of marijuana.  He submitted a treatise from the National Institute on\nDrug Abuse, published in June 2018, a fact sheet from the Drug Enforcement Administration, and\nan article from the FBI.  He testified that he did not recall when he conducted his research but that\nit was before he completed his 2017 SCA.  He stated that, during his 2018 interview, he did not\nmention his research because he was not asked about it.\nApplicant submitted numerous letters from friends, associates, former teachers, university\nprofessors, a law enforcement official, a National Guard recruiter, and co-workers attesting to his\ngood character, reliability, honesty, and trustworthiness.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n2\n\nThe Judge found that Applicant had \u201ccarefully crafted\u201d his SCA answers as well as his\nstatements to the investigator in order to overcome his prior disclosures of drug use.  Decision at 7. \nHe noted Applicant\u2019s testimony that his doubts about the nature of the substance he used in 2014\nwere based on research he claimed to have conducted on Government websites.  However, he stated\nthat at least one of the purported documents that Applicant submitted at the hearing postdated the\n2017 SCA.  Moreover, Applicant never mentioned this research prior to the hearing, raising the\nimplication that his testimony was a recent fabrication.  In any event, the Judge stated that the exact\nnature of the substance in question was not crucial.  Rather, the gravamen of Applicant\u2019s case was\nhis failure to be candid about his effort to purchase and use marijuana.  The Judge found Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations for his denial of drug use in his 2017 SCA and during the subsequent interview  lacked\ncredibility.  In the whole-person analysis, the Judge reiterated previous comments to the effect that\nApplicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate.  He found Applicant\u2019s argument that there was no proof\nabout the true nature of the substance that he used in 2014 to be beside the point.   \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contain errors.  He states that, contrary\nto the Judge\u2019s finding, he has children, as evidenced by the contents of several of his character\nletters.  He also argues that the Judge erred in finding that one of his documentary exhibits had been\npublished in 2018.  He states that it had been revised in 2018, which means that it had been\npublished before then.  The Judge\u2019s finding about the children appears to have been based upon\nGovernment Exhibit 1, the 2017 SCA, which discloses no children among Applicant\u2019s relatives. \nHowever, as Applicant notes in his Appeal Brief, several of his character references cite to his status\nas a father.  See, e.g., Letter from Wife, dated April 1, 2019, included in Applicant Exhibit II.  The\nchallenged finding appears to be erroneous.  However, it did not likely exert an influence on the\noutcome of the case and, therefore, is harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02302 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJun. 26, 2019.  Concerning the other finding, the distinction between whether a document was\npublished in 2018 or simply revised in that year is without significance in the case before us. \nApplicant testified that he had consulted documents from Government websites prior to his 2017\nSCA.  Obviously, he could not have consulted one of the documents that he submitted at the hearing,\ninsofar as it bore a revision date of a year later.  The Judge did not err in his finding about this\nmatter, and even if he did, such error was also harmless.  The Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are based upon substantial evidence.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 17-01680 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.\n19, 2019). \n  \nApplicant argues that the whole-person analysis is flawed.  The Judge\u2019s adverse decision\nrested on his conclusion that Applicant failed to demonstrate the candor required of someone who\nholds a security clearance.  This conclusion is consistent with the record viewed as a whole.  The\nJudge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in that he\nconsidered the totality of the evidence in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03592\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2017). \n \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR listed 12 allegations.  The Judge found against Applicant on six of them.  In\nresponding the SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation that the Judge found against him.  The\nJudge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant has owed federal and/or state income taxes since he filed his tax\nreturns for tax year 2014 in 2016.  He made substantial progress on his non-tax debts;\nhowever, it was mostly after the statement of reasons (SOR) was issued.  In the\nprevious 15 years, he filed bankruptcy twice, had three expensive vehicles\nrepossessed, and short sold his residence.  Financial considerations security concerns\nare not mitigated.  Eligibility access to classified information is denied. [Decision at\n1.] \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision \u201cwas solely based on my financial issues that\nwere 10 to 15 years old.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  He noted that he was not required to disclose his prior\nbankruptcy filings on his security clearance application due to their age and stated he \u201cdidn\u2019t realize\n[his] financial history from 10 to 15 years ago would be in question.\u201d  Id.  These assertions are not\npersuasive.  First, Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge\u2019s decision was \u201csolely based\u201d on dated\nfinancial deficiencies is simply not accurate.   The Judge\u2019s adverse findings include recent financial\nconcerns, such as Applicant\u2019s past-due Federal taxes for 2017 and his past-due state taxes for 2014,\n2016, and 2017.  Second, past and present financial deficiencies are relevant considerations in\nassessing an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  See, e.g., Disqualifying Condition 19(c),\nwhich provides \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. \u00b6 19(c).  Third, to the extent that Applicant is raising\na due process issue, the SOR gave Applicant adequate notice that his prior bankruptcies would be\nconsidered in determining his security clearance eligibility.  Finally, we note the Judge properly cited\nto ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004) for the proposition that he could consider\ncertain non-alleged financial deficiencies for limited purposes \u2013 such as in assessing an applicant\u2019s\ncredibility; evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances;\ndetermining whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and conducting a\nwhole-person assessment.  Applicant has failed to show the Judge erred in his consideration of\nApplicant\u2019s past financial delinquencies.      \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s argument amounts to a challenge to the way in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence.  For example, he challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he did not take\n\nsignificant steps to resolve his financial problems until the SOR was issued.  He argues that the SOR\nissuance coincided with his efforts to address his financial problems so that his son could qualify for\nan educational loan.  His arguments are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n07277 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2017). \nApplicant requests that he be granted a temporary security clearance and then provide him\nan opportunity to updated his financial status.  Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge\ncommitted any harmful error or that he should be granted a conditional security clearance under\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. C.  The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn September 30, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 19 delinquent debts totaling over $67,000.  In\nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations; however, the Government\nwithdrew an alleged medical debt of approximately $403.  Excluding the withdrawn allegation, the\nJudge found against Applicant on all of the SOR allegations.  Regarding the largest alleged debt,\npast-due student loans totaling over $62,000, the Judge noted that Applicant claimed he was making\nmonthly payment of $416 towards that debt but submitted nothing to support his claim.  The Judge\nconcluded that none of the Guideline F mitigating condition were establishing, noting that Applicant\nhas a long history of delinquencies and has done little to address them.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises a due process issue regarding his post-hearing submission. \nSpecifically, he states:\n[The Judge] stated that I had not made any efforts to pay any of my debts or show\n[sic] proof of arrangements made.  However, I emailed and sent through the post\noffice, proof of payments made during the 60 day time period from my court date\nuntil the closing statement was due.  I tried to fax my information to his office and\nwas told they were having technical problems and to email them.  I called to confirm\nthat they had received my information and was told that they had.  [Appeal Brief at\n1.]\nIn the decision, the Judge noted that he marked Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.  This exhibit consists of a three-page rental car agreement and one-page closing\nstatement.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents that are not in the record.  In general, we cannot\nconsider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However, we will considered such evidence\nconcerning threshold issues of jurisdiction or due process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00812 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).  From our review of this assignment of error, we conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nassertions in his appeal brief are not sufficient to establish a prima facie showing that he in fact\nemailed or mailed to DOHA the documents in question.  We note that some of those documents\npertain to payments that were made after the decision was issued.  To the extent that Applicant relies\non evidence that was created after the record closed, we cannot consider it.  Furthermore, even if\nApplicant had submitted to DOHA the documents predating the Judge\u2019s decision that did not make\ninto the record, any error in the processing or handling of those documents would have been\nharmless because it likely would not have affected the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\n2\n\nNo. 12-00678 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2014).  The documents in question do not show consistent\npayments towards the alleged debts.  For example, those documents show only two student loan debt\npayments (i.e., a $225 payment in June 2018 and $421 payment in July 2019) before the record\nclosed.  Such evidence falls short of establishing a track record of payments that would mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from the student loan debt.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant also notes that his financial problems arose from his wife\u2019s\nmedical expenses, that he has served the Government either in the military or as a contractor for over\n40 years, and that he is taking steps to address his debts.  His arguments are not enough to show the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).  Applicant also asserts that keeping his\nsecurity clearance is imperative to him paying his debts and taking care of other obligations.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDaniel P. Meyer, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 25, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nFebruary 13, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in his findings and\nconclusions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in his 40s, is married with a minor child.  In about 2017, he resigned from \na job when his employer was poised to terminate his employment for violating a non-compete\nagreement by failing to obtain prior approval before working simultaneously for another entity. \nWhen he obtained the second job, he did not either realize that he had signed such an agreement or\nunderstand what it entailed.  \nAt an earlier job in 2016, Applicant allegedly falsified records by mischarging approximately\n300 hours of work.  Applicant denied that he intentionally defrauded this employer.  At that time,\nhis work status was somewhat muddled.  He was an office worker who was occasionally permitted\nto telework due to a shortage of work space in the office.  At one point, he assumed he was a regular\nteleworker because other employees were full-time teleworkers.  In the office, a badge-in, badge-out\nsystem was employed to track attendance.  At times, Applicant would \u201cpiggyback\u201d on another\nemployee when going through the scanner to enter the facility or be manually permitted to enter the\nfacility by a third party.  Applicant possibly also did not receive credit for his work when he was\nteleworking at home without authorization.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted this\nallegation.  \nWhile Applicant denied violating the non-compete agreement, \u201cit is difficult to fathom a\nprofessional at mid-career in this industry would not know he had at least some responsibility to tell\nhis primary employer he was accepting work of the same nature on the side.  This is particularly true\nwhen the individual should clearly recognize there would ultimately be repercussions, personal or\nprofessional, from working a full time job elsewhere.\u201d  Decision at 5.   As for the alleged\nfalsification of work records, a responsible professional would have also sought clarification as to\nhow to document his work hours and where those hours should be spent.  However, he later took\nsteps to clarified these issues.\nDiscussion\n2\n\nApplicant relies extensively on decisions of  Hearing Office Judges to support his arguments. \nHe cites those decisions to show that Judges decided particular issues or cases in favor of applicants. \nHis reliance on those Hearing Office decisions is misplaced.  Decisions by Hearing Office Judges\nare not legally binding precedent that the Appeal Board must follow.  The Board is neither required\nto justify why it chooses not to follow Hearing Office decisions nor required to reconcile its\ndecisions with such lower decisions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Feb. 28,\n2005).  Nor are Hearing Office Judges required to follow\u2013or otherwise justify or reconcile their\ndecisions with\u2013other Hearing Office decisions.  Each case must be decided on its own merits. \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).   In this case, the Hearing Office decisions cited in the appeal brief\ndo not establish a reason for concluding the Judge erred in his analysis of the facts or in his drawing\nof conclusions.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief also contains a document that is not included in the record.  This\ndocument (identified as Tab A) appears to be a supplement to Applicant\u2019s testimony.   The Appeal\nBoard is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.    \nApplicant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the Judge\u2019s adverse findings.\nHe argues that the employer\u2019s inquiry into his suspected falsification of records was flawed because\nthe employer was measuring flawed data and contends the Judge overemphasized Applicant\u2019s\nadmission of that SOR allegation.  As for the alleged violation of the non-compete agreement, he\nargues that he did not understand the repercussions of his actions and he was following the corporate\nnorm.  We do not find these arguments persuasive.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings and conclusions of a security concern are based on substantial evidence or\nconstitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).  In this regard, we have previously stated that an\nemployers\u2019s description or characterization of events arising from an inquiry into an employee\u2019s\novercharging of hours was entitled to some degree of deference.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03446\nat 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2019).  We are also required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nApplicant notes that the Judge erred in stating he was terminated from two jobs.  Although\nthe evidence establishes that Applicant resigned in lieu of being terminated for the violation of the\nnon-compete agreement, this error was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013). \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider evidence and did not properly weigh the\nevidence.  His arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).   \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\n3\n\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On June\n7, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings regarding the Guideline F\nallegations were not raised as an issue on appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in his 30s, is married and has three children.  He served in the military\nfrom 2006 to 2014 and was granted a security clearance.  He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is\npursuing a master\u2019s degree.  Since 2015, he has worked for a defense contractor.  He also is part-\nowner of a company seeking Government contracts and a DoD facility clearance.\nThe SOR alleged three falsifications.  Applicant admitted that he falsified responses to\nquestions in a security clearance application (SCA) submitted in 2005.  In those responses, he denied\nthat, in the past seven years, he illegally used drugs and denied having been involved in the illegal\npurchase, manufacturing, trafficking, production, sale, etc., of any narcotic, cannabis, or other types\nof drugs during that period.  Applicant indicated that he intentionally falsified those responses\nbecause he was concerned that his drug involvement would have precluded him from enlisting in the\nmilitary. \nIn 2010, Applicant submitted an SCA in which he denied illegally using any controlled\nsubstances in the last seven years.   In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted he falsified this\nresponse but claimed his illegal drug activity occurred only in his teenage years.  \u201cHe intentionally\nfalsified the SCA after he was advised by unnamed individual(s) to never divulge his illegal drug use\ndue to potential negative consequences while he was an enlisted member . . . .\u201d  Decision at 3.  A\nFederal agency reported that Applicant used marijuana from 2003 to 2007, sold marijuana from 2003\nto 2005, and sold crack cocaine in 2003.  He contended that he provided information during a\npolygraph due to stress and in an attempt to pass the test.  At the hearing, Applicant testified that,\nwhile in high school, he and friends sold about $2,000 to $3,000 worth of marijuana that he had\nstolen, and he claimed that he made inaccurate statements to the polygrapher, including that he used\nillegal drugs in the military and that his last use occurred in 2007.  During cross-examination, he also\ninitially denied engaging in certain drug activity that he later admitted engaging in it.\nIn October 2015, Applicant submitted an SCA in which he denied ever having his security\nclearance eligibility or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked.  Early that year, a\n2\n\nGovernment agency revoked his access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI).  In his SOR\nresponse, he denied falsifying the SCA response, claiming he did not realize his SCI access had been\nrevoked.  However, he testified that he answered \u201cNo\u201d because he thought the question pertained\nonly to security clearances and believed only his facility access was denied when he escorted from\nthe building after failing a polygraph. \n   The Judge\u2019s Analysis\nAppellant admitted he falsified responses in two SCAs.  Applicant provided inconsistent\nstatements.  His claim that he did not falsify his 2015 SCA was not credible.  He has demonstrated\na pattern of dishonesty, casting doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  None\nof the mitigating conditions apply.   \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains assertions that are not included in the record.  For example,\nApplicant argues that the Judge should have sua sponte taken administrative notice of policies and\nprocedures of another Federal agency and then proceeds to provide information about those\npurported matters.  In the past, the Appeal Board has stated a party that does not ask a Judge to take\nadministrative notice of a specific matter at the hearing has a heavy burden on appeal of\ndemonstrating that the Judge\u2019s inaction was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-11570 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge\nerred in failing to take administrative notice of the purported matters.  Additionally, the appeal brief\ncontains a document that post-dates the Judge\u2019s decision.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from\nconsidering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.1 \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, mis-weighed the\nevidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  For\nexample, he argues \u201c[his] 2010 lie was a continuation of his 2005 SF86 submission and should not\nbe viewed as a separate and distinct issue.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 3.  He cites no authority supporting that\nproposition.  He also asserts that he mis-spoke due to stress when he advised the polygrapher of the\nyear in which he last used marijuana.  He further states that the Judge erred in failing to analyze\nunder Mitigating Condition 17(b)2 his claim that military recruiters told him not to disclose his\nillegal drug use when he was completing his SCA in 2005.  Overarching these arguments is the\n1 The new evidence includes a document described as an expert witness report.  That report quotes extensively\nfrom guidelines.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 15, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 10 delinquent debts.  At the hearing, Department\nCounsel withdrew one allegation.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on five of the debts and\nagainst her on the remaining four debts.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted those four\ndebts.  After noting that Applicant and her husband had about $2,000 of monthly disposable income,\nthe Judge concluded that Applicant did not seriously begin to address the delinquent debts until the\nsecurity clearance process was initiated and that she did not present sufficient evidence to show she\nresponsibly managed the delinquent debts under the circumstances.  The Judge also concluded:\nAlthough [Applicant] testified candidly about her delinquent debts, it was clear that\nshe did not have a firm grasp on her debts and budget, and has not established a solid\nand significant track record of responsible financial management.  . . .  After listening\nto Applicant\u2019s testimony, observing her demeanor, and reviewing her new budget,\nI believe that she is now more committed to responsibly managing her financial\nobligations.  However, the record evidence leaves me with concerns as to Applicant\u2019s\njudgment and suitability for a security clearance at this time. [Decision at 7-8.] \n \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29. \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding the four debts at issue were either\nunresolved or not sufficiently resolved.  In general, her arguments rely on the new evidence that we\ncannot consider.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of\na security concern are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could\nbe drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nApplicant also contends the Judge\u2019s conclusions quoted above are contradictory.  We do not\nread those conclusions in that manner.  A Judge\u2019s conclusion that an applicant is now committed to\nhandling his or her financial obligations responsibly does not preclude the Judge from also\nconcluding  security concerns arising from the applicant\u2019s prior handling of those obligations have\nnot been mitigated.   \nIn her brief, Applicant states that revocation of her security clearance has resulted in her\nbeing terminated from her job and has made repayment of the debts more difficult.  She notes her\ncompany is willing to reinstate her if she is granted a security clearance.  The Directive, however,\ndoes not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n04202 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 24, 2015).  \n2\n\nApplicant also proposes that her eligibility be returned \u201con a conditional basis.\u201d  Applicant\nhas failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she should be granted a\nconditional security clearance under Directive, Encl. 2, App. C.  The Judge examined the relevant\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On June\n21, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 31, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant works for a Federal contractor.  She was granted a position of trust in 2003 and\nhas held it ever since.  Applicant\u2019s SOR alleged numerous offenses, including many that involved\nalcohol.  In 2006, she was charged with drinking in a retail area and with assault.  Both charges were\nnolle prosequi.  Approximately two years later, she was charged with driving while impaired, second\ndegree assault, disorderly conduct, and failure to obey a lawful order.  She pled guilty to the alcohol\noffense and received probation before judgment.  During her period of probation she was required\nto abstain from alcohol and completed the probation successfully.  Applicant also received alcohol-\nrelated counseling and was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-mild.\nIn early 2011, Applicant was again arrested for driving while impaired by alcohol.  She pled\nguilty to the charge and received supervised probation.  She underwent alcohol-related counseling\nand was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder-severe.  She was required to remain abstinent during\nthe probation period.  \nIn 2014, Applicant was arrested again for driving while impaired by alcohol.  Found guilty,\nshe was sentenced to 60 days confinement, with 58 days suspended, placed on a weekender\u2019s work\nprogram, and on supervised probation and parole.  She successfully completed a 48-week counseling\nprogram.\nIn 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. \nConvicted of this offense, she was sentenced to one year of supervised probation.  Other related\noffenses\u2013failure to display her driver\u2019s license, failure to drive in \u201cright half,\u201d failure to obey a stop\nsign, failure to respond to signal by police, and making a left turn from an improper position\u2013were\nplaced in an inactive docket after entry of her guilty plea.\nLater that year, Applicant was arrested for driving a vehicle not equipped with an ignition\ninterlock.  The charge was nolle prosequi.  However, she pled guilty to driving on a suspended\nlicense.  She was sentenced to a year of confinement, suspended for 30 days.  She appealed and was\nultimately sentenced to two years of supervised probation and a $1,000 fine.  Still later the same\nyear, Applicant was charged with failure to display her drivers license and to driving without a\nlicense.  These charges were nolle prosequi, apparently as a result of a plea agreement regarding the\npreviously-discussed offense.\n2\n\nIn early 2018, Applicant was admitted to a state-sponsored recovery center.  She attended\nvarious meetings, group therapy sessions, and Alcoholics Anonymous.  There is no evidence of her\nreturn to drinking during this program.  She was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, moderate-\nsevere.  Her prognosis for continued sobriety is considered to be good. \n Applicant\u2019s supervisors describe her as an excellent worker\u2013conscientious, ethical, and\nreliable.  She disclosed her alcohol offenses and treatment to them.  She has expressed remorse for\nher offenses and states that she has been abstinent since May 2017.  Her treatment programs have \nincluded medications and therapy to provide her with the tools necessary to stop drinking.  She has\nmade lifestyle changes.  She lives with her family, who provide emotional support to her.  She states\nthat she is working very hard on her recovery.  She is concerned about the financial consequences\nif she should not get a clearance.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s last DUI occurred in 2017, \u201cand there is no evidence of any\nalcohol-related misconduct\u201d after then.  Decision at 7.  He cited to her rehabilitation program, her\nchanged personal circumstances, her love for her job and her concern over the consequences should\nshe be denied access to classified information.  He stated that she clearly understands that her\neligibility for a clearance depends on continued sobriety.  The Judge concluded that it is unlikely that\nApplicant will engage in alcohol-related misconduct in the future.  He stated that Applicant \u201chas\ndemonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior\u201d  to show that her security-significant conduct\nis behind her.  Decision at 8.\nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure\n2 \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).    \n3\n\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not supported by the\nweight of the record evidence, viewed as a totality.  We find this argument persuasive.  We note the\nfollowing evidence, drawn from the Judge\u2019s findings and from the record:\n1.  In 2006, Applicant was charged with drinking in a retail location and with assault. \nThe assault charge arose from her interaction with law enforcement personnel.  \nDecision at 2; Tr. at 32; Government Exhibit (GE) 3, State District Court Case\nInformation; GE 2, Interview Summary Included in Answers to Interrogatories.    \n2.  Applicant was charged four times for operating a vehicle under the influence of\nalcohol.  In early 2018, Applicant served two months in jail for her 2017 DUI\noffense.  Decision at 2-3; GE 4-7; State District Court Case Information; Tr. at 53-54;\nGE 2 at 2.\n3.  Applicant received alcohol-related counseling as a consequence of her offenses. \nHer counselors advised her to abstain from alcohol.  \u201c[Q]: By your recollection, do\nyou recall if they told you . . . to abstain from future alcohol use?  To not use? [A]:\nYeah.  Every single treatment, yes, they have.\u201d  Tr. at 43-44.\n4.  Despite these recommendations, Applicant resumed consuming alcohol and\nengaged in subsequent alcohol-related misconduct, most recently in 2017.  Decision\nat 2-4; GE 5-7, State District Court Case Information.    \n5.  Applicant was diagnosed on at least three occasions with alcohol use disorder of\nvarying degrees of severity.  Decision at 2-3.\n6.  Applicant was charged with other offenses ancillary to her DUI convictions, for\nexample, driving without a license, failing to have an ignition interlock device, and\nvarious traffic offenses.  Decision at 3-4; GE 7-10, State District Court Case\nInformation.  \n7.  Although she testified that she has been abstinent since her 2017 DUI and is\nworking hard on her future, she also testified that she could \u201cnever say that this is\nover and that I will never, ever in my life I will drink again because I will be lying to\nyou here.\u201d   Tr. at 62.\nAs noted above, once the Government presents substantial evidence of security concerns, the\napplicant bears the burden of persuasion that he or she should have a clearance.  A clearance\nadjudication must be based upon an examination of the record as a whole, in light of the Egan\nstandard.  The Directive requires that any doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance must\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  We conclude that\nthe evidence in this case does not support the Judge\u2019s favorable analysis.\n4\n\nThe security concerns under both Guidelines cited in Applicant\u2019s SOR provide that the\nmisuse of alcohol and criminal offenses raise questions about an applicant\u2019s judgment,\ntrustworthiness, and reliability.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 21, 30.  Under the facts of the case\nbefore us, insofar as both the Alcohol Consumption and the Criminal Conduct allegations are rooted\nin the abuse of alcohol, the record presents substantial reasons to question whether Applicant has\nproblems with impulse control that go to the heart of her ability to protect classified information. \nWe note the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant has not consumed alcohol since her 2017 DUI. \nHowever, as we have stated before, the length of time through which an applicant might establish\nthat his or her offenses have been consigned to the past varies from case to case.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 18-01926 at (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019).  In Applicant\u2019s case, the record shows that\nApplicant has repeatedly resumed consuming alcohol despite having been advised by her counselors\nto abstain altogether.  Moreover, her alcohol offenses were exacerbated by a host of other infractions,\nincluding assault and, about three months after her last DUI, driving under a license that had been\nsuspended as a result of that offense.  These other infractions must be brought to bear in examining\nthe extent to which Applicant has established mitigation, particularly her testimony that as of the date\nof the hearing she still did not have an unrestricted driver\u2019s license.  Tr. at 60.  That she is still\nundergoing some measure of penalty for her security-significant conduct is inconsistent with Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that enough time had passed between her misconduct and the close of the record to show\nthat her problems are unlikely to recur, that she has established rehabilitation, and that her\nmisconduct does not impugn her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nAdditionally, we have considered the Judge\u2019s findings about Applicant\u2019s most recent alcohol\ntreatment, the laudatory views of her supervisors, and the Judge\u2019s conclusion that she is genuinely\nremorseful.  Given the extent of Applicant\u2019s offenses, their occurrence over more than a decade, and\nher having repeatedly failed to follow professional advice to abstain from future alcohol\nconsumption, we conclude that the evidence Applicant has submitted is not sufficient to mitigate the\nconcerns raised in her SOR under the standard set forth in Egan.  The Judge\u2019s decision runs contrary\nto the weight of the record evidence and is not sustainable.\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan           \nMichael Y.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 17, 2019, Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding a\nGuideline E allegation.  On January 22, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against him\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s\nfavorable findings under Guidelines B, C, and F have not been raised as issues on appeal and are not\ndiscussed below.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact\nApplicant is 45 years old.  He served in the U.S. military and received an honorable\ndischarge.  He worked as a Federal employee from 2007 to 2017.  He later worked for a DoD\ncontractor until he recently became unemployed.  He has earned a dual master\u2019s degree in two related\nfields and is working towards a Ph.D.  He and his wife each have a child from other relationships. \n  \nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him.  He\nwas not convicted of any offense as a result of an altercation with her.  At the hearing, he was unable\nor unwilling to recall the details of this altercation.  \nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife was serving in the U.S. military overseas.  At that time, he and she\nhad a physical altercation while they were living in Government housing.  When questioned by \ninvestigators, he stated that his wife tried to push him out of bed with her legs while she was making\nbelittling statements.  In trying to stop her from engaging in that conduct, he got on top of her while\nshe was lying face down and grabbed her by the face and head.  She was struggling the whole time. \nHe stated that he did not turn or twist her head.  He thought that marks on her face documented in\nphotographs were the result of him grabbing her.  Knowing that she was going to call security, he\nunplugged the phone.  The investigative report noted that they both sustained bruises during this\nincident.  The military commander ordered him to move out of base housing until further notice. \nApplicant told investigators that he and his wife had two prior incidents involving the police: a\npushing incident in 2004 and a verbal argument in 2006.  Applicant was not convicted of any offense\nas a result of this incident but received marital counseling.  At the hearing, he was unable or\nunwilling to recall details of this altercation. \nIn responding to the SOR in July 2019, Applicant stated, \u201c[a]fter going to counseling and\nworking together as a team, my wife and I came out strong and closer than ever before.  We have\n2\n\nfound healthy ways to handle conflict, so I can say with utmost confidence that the behaviors from\nthe past will not recur.\u201d  Decision at 5, quoting from SOR Response at 6.  In August 2019, Applicant\nwas arrested for an altercation with his wife and charged with assault and battery.  On that occasion,\nhe became upset with his wife because he believed she was having an extramarital affair.  After \narguing for several hours, they engaged in mutual shoving.  She tried to burn photos of his deceased\nfather.  He told a magistrate that \u201che pushed her by the stove, and also that he may have pulled her\nhair.\u201d Decision at 6, quoting from Government Exhibit 5 at 4.   The paperwork concerning the \ndisposition of the charge is not in the record, and Applicant did not understand whether the\nproceeding included in a guilty plea.  He was placed on probation until October 2020 and paid $450\nto enable him to begin an 18-week, court-ordered domestic violence course.  He may be able to have\nthe charge dismissed. \nIn 2019, Applicant received an excellent annual performance review.  A number of his co-\nworkers and friends indicate that he is trustworthy and diligent.  He has contributed significantly to\nthe company\u2019s mission accomplishment.         \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Analysis\nApplicant has engaged in a pattern of domestic altercations that demonstrate questionable\njudgment, unreliability, untrustworthiness, and unwillingness to comply with rules.  None of the\nGuideline E mitigating conditions fully apply.  His most recent domestic altercation occurred after\nhe responded to the SOR by stating future incidents of that nature would not recur.  He is on\nprobation and has not completed the rehabilitation process.  The personal conduct security concerns\nare not mitigated. \nDiscussion\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s finding that he was unable or unwilling to recall the details\nof the 2004 and 2007 altercations was \u201cunrealistic, and the implication that [Applicant] was not\nbeing cooperative and forthcoming is inflammatory and shows bias against [him].\u201d  Appeal Brief\nat 11.  Bias is not demonstrated merely because the Judge makes an adverse ruling, finding, or\ncredibility determination.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00661 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2018).  There\nis a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome\nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  Id . at 3.  In this case, Applicant\u2019s arguments\nfail to establish the Judge was biased against him.    \nApplicant asserts that the Judge \u201creferenced a \u2018promise\u2019 made by [Applicant] in July 2019,\nthat domestic disturbance situations would not occur in the future.  [Applicant] never made a\n\u2018promise\u2019 that  further domestic disturbances would not occur in the future.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 11. \nApplicant called the Judge\u2019s conclusion absurd and unrealistic.  In the findings of fact, the Judge\ncorrectly quoted  a pertinent comment in Applicant\u2019s SOR Response, i.e., that he and his wife had\ncome out of counseling stronger and closer than ever, and he \u201ccan say with the utmost confidence\nthat the behaviors of the past will not recur.\u201d  From our review of the record, we find no reason to\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s characterization of this comment as a \u201cpromise\u201d was either an\n3\n\nunreasonable interpretation of the evidence or, more to the point, was a conclusion that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.   \nApplicant further contends the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, mis-weighed the\nevidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  In his\narguments, he highlights, for example, that two of the three domestic alternations occurred more than\nten years ago, that neither of those two incidents resulted in him being charged or convicted of any\noffense, that his wife instigated the altercations in 2007 and 2019, that he has participated in\ncounseling and rehabilitation, and that he is complying with the existing court-ordered requirements. \nThe Judge, however, addressed most of those matters in his decision.  Applicant\u2019s arguments are\nneither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record\nnor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nAdditionally, the Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis\nby considering the totality of the evidence in reaching his decision. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant experienced a business downturn and eventual business failure that\nconcluded with selling the business in late 2011.  The resulting financial problems\nincluded bankruptcy court proceedings, foreclosure of his personal residence, and tax\nproblems with state and federal tax authorities.  Pursuant to federal tax liens, he still\nowes the IRS about $66,000 for a civil penalty for multiple tax periods.  Although\nthe conditions that resulted in his financial problems were largely beyond his control,\nhis tax problems with the IRS have gone on for too many years to justify complete\nmitigation.  Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. [Decision at 1.]\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not contained in the\nrecord.  We cannot consider new evidence on appeal.

[Appeal Brief at 1.]\nThe language that Applicant is challenging is not a finding the Judge made regarding him.  Rather,\nthe challenged language is part of the Judge\u2019s quote from the Concern Paragraph in Guideline F.1 \nThe Judge cited the Concern Paragraph to set the stage for his analysis of the facts in the case.

On April\n5, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On June 9, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Braden M.\nMurphy denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant, an accountant and business manager by training, was terminated\nfor cause in 2014 for failing to complete a company financial audit as required.  She\nwas later found to have used a company credit card for personal purposes on\nnumerous occasions, charging several thousand dollars, without authorization and\nwithout reimbursing her employer.  That conduct later led to criminal charges, which\nwere dismissed after Applicant participated in a pretrial intervention program and\npaid restitution.  Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the\nresulting security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J\n(criminal conduct).  Applicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified\ninformation is denied. [Decision at 1.]\nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with explanations.  The\nJudge found over $29,800 of personal charges were made on Applicant\u2019s corporate credit card in\n2013 and 2014.  The Judge concluded that he did not find Applicant\u2019s \u201cjustifications for her actions\nbelievable.\u201d  Decision at 4 and 11.   In his analysis, the Judge stated:\nApplicant asserted that personal use of corporate credit cards was sanctioned \nby [the corporate president].  This, too, rings hollow, as it was [the corporate\npresident] who terminated Applicant and later provided the information to state\ninvestigators that led directly to the criminal charges.  In addition, the company\nhandbook detailed the restrictions on use of a corporate credit card, and [the\ncorporate president] counseled Applicant early in her time at Company X not to use\nher corporate credit card for personal purposes.  This evidence, too, cuts against\nApplicant\u2019s assertions that her actions were sanctioned.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to perform the audit led to her termination in . . . 2014. \nApplicant asserted that she was not trying to hide anything about her conduct by\nfailing to complete the audit, and was not worried that anything would be discovered. \nI do not really believe this, but there is no concrete evidence in the record to the\ncontrary.  Regardless, Applicant\u2019s failure to perform an important aspect of her job,\nin the face of requests from her supervisor to do so, is another example of\n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s breach of a fiduciary duty to her employer and a disregard for rules and\nregulations. [Decision at 10.] \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact.\nInstead, she contends the Judge did not consider her whole-person evidence and challenges some of\nhis conclusions.  Specifically, for example, she disputes his conclusions that he did not believe she\nwas not trying to hide anything by failing to perform the audit and did not believe her personal use\nof the corporate credit card was sanctioned by the corporate president.  In this regard, it should be\nnoted that the Appeal Board gives deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  In general, Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence and are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 9, 2017).  Moreover, we conclude that the Judge took into account all aspects of the record\nevidence which bore upon Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability, which is what a whole-person\nanalysis requires.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMarc Napolitana, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n13, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 15, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her evidentiary\nand procedural rulings, whether the Judge erred in her findings of fact, whether the Judge was biased,\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\nwith the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in her early 50s, has worked for five Federal contractors since early 2015. \nWhile she has taken college courses, she has not earned any college degrees.  \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified Electronic Questionnaires for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIPs) in 2014 and 2017 by listing she received bachelor\u2019s degrees in\n1991 and 2005 and master\u2019s degrees in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003; falsified the 2017 e-QIP by\nfailing to disclose that she was involuntarily terminated from jobs in 2015 and 2016; falsified the\n2017 e-QIP by listing she was a Marine Corps employee for about 2 years; falsified the 2017 e-QIP\nby listing she was in the Air Force Inactive Reserves for about 11 years and received an honorable\ndischarge; and falsified a resume submitted to a contractor in 2017 by claiming she had various\ncredentials.  It also alleges that she was terminated from contractor employment in 2016 for\nmisrepresenting that she was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) employee while at a Veterans\nAffairs (VA) clinic. \nApplicant attributed the mistakes regarding her educational background in her e-QIP to\ncomputer connectivity problems.  She indicated that she rushed through the applications and failed\nto review her responses before submission.  She claimed she mistakenly listed educational\ncertificates as degrees, noting she had trouble with the drop-down menus.  A special agent testified\nthere is no educational  \u201ccertificate\u201d category in the e-QIP.  Applicant stated that she did not disclose\none job termination on her e-QIP because she did not receive a termination notice, but she knew the\ntermination related to a false accusation regarding a badge incident at a VA clinic.  She indicated her\nfailure to list the other job termination on the e-QIP was an unintentional oversight.\nApplicant acknowledged that she should not have listed the Marine Corps as an employer\nin the 2017 e-QIP but noted she performed voluntary security services at sporting events for a\nmilitary-related foundation composed of retired military members and their spouses.  She testified\nthat she never served in the Air Force but had participated in the Civil Air Patrol.  She attributed\n2\n\nthese discrepancies on her e-QIP to typographical errors and connectivity problems.  She denied that\nshe attempted to falsify in her resume, stating it was a working copy that was not intended for\ndistribution.  She also noted her computer was hacked and did not know which resume was on the\ninternet.  The statement on the resume that she was a helicopter pilot was a typographical error.   She\ndenied ever representing herself as an employee of the FBI but noted that agency offered her a job\nabout 13 years ago.  People may have misunderstood her comments about that offer and mistakenly\nthought she worked for that agency.\nUnder Guideline I, the SOR alleged that a licenced psychologist diagnosed Applicant with\nantisocial personality disorder in 2019 and gave her a poor prognosis.  The psychologist determined\nApplicant\u2019s disorder impaired her judgment and ability to safeguard classified information.  In a\npost-hearing submission, Applicant provided an evaluation from an clinical neuropsychologist who\ndid not provide a diagnosis or clearance recommendation but noted Applicant\u2019s self-reporting\nassessment scores fell outside the normal range, which suggests she may not have been \u201ccompletely\nforthright\u201d in her responses.   Decision at 9.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant deliberately provided false and misleading information to contractors and in her\n2014 and 2017 e-QIPs.  None of the pertinent mitigating conditions under Guideline E were\nestablished.  She continues to deny all of the allegations and claims she made unintentional mistakes\non her e-QIPs and resumes due to being rushed, unintentional oversight, or computer problems. \n\u201cNone of these explanations are credible or persuasive regarding the specific false information she\nprovided.\u201d  Decision at 12.\nA psychologist diagnosed Applicant with a mental health disorder that impairs her ability to\nsafeguard classified information.  \u201cThe evaluation she submitted in rebuttal to the Government\u2019s\nevaluation did not focus on her reported falsifications, but primarily assessed her cognitive\nfunctioning.\u201d   Decision at 13.  The rebuttal evaluation did not articulate a diagnosis or prognosis\nand is not persuasive.  None of the pertinent Guideline I mitigating conditions apply.\nDiscussion\nEvidentiary and Procedural Rulings\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel  contends that the Judge committed various evidentiary and procedural\nerrors.  The Board examines a Judge\u2019s challenged evidentiary and procedural rulings to determine\nwhether they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, which includes determining whether \nrulings are inconsistent with provisions in the Directive.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  See also, ISCR Case\nNo. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).  At this stage, it merits noting that Applicant represented\nherself at the hearing below.\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel first asserts the Judge failed to consider Applicant\u2019s objection to\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1, Applicant\u2019s 2017 e-QIP.  In support of his argument, he cites only a\n3\n\nportion of the exchange between the Judge and Applicant and argues that \u201cthe objection was not\naccurately fleshed out by the Judge.\u201d  This assignment of error lacks merit.  On its face, GE 1 is an\nofficial record that is admissible in DOHA proceedings.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-30913 at 4\n(App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2005).  Applicant digitally signed GE 1; certified that her statements in it were\ntrue, complete, and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief; and submitted it to the\nGovernment to obtain national security eligibility.1  The truthfulness of her responses to questions\nin GE 1 are critical aspects of SOR allegations presented to Judge for adjudication.  Under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.20, such an official record may be received into evidence without an authenticating witness. \nOf note, not cited in the appeal brief is the initial portion of Applicant\u2019s objection in which she\nindicated that she intended to offer into evidence a \u201ccorrect\u201d e-QIP.  Tr. at 16.   The Judge knew that\nApplicant\u2019s intent to present a \u201ccorrect\u201d e-QIP\u2014which was entered into evidence as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit (AE) A and was prepared by Applicant the night before the hearing (Tr. at 21 and 129)\u2014had\nno bearing on the admissibility of GE 1.  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s ruling admitting GE 1 into\nevidence.\nSecond, Applicant\u2019s Counsel notes that, when Applicant was asked if she had any objection\nto GE 5, she responded by stating it was not a \u201ctrue resume\u201d and indicating it was apparently\ndistributed after her computer was hacked.  Appeal Brief at 6, quoting from Tr. at 18.  Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel argues the Judge admitted GE 5 into evidence without properly entertaining Applicant\u2019s\nchallenge to its authenticity.  While the Judge should have first asked Department Counsel to address\nApplicant\u2019s apparent challenge to the authenticity of GE 5 before ruling on its admissibility, any\nerror that may have occurred was harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n1, 2020) (an error is harmless if it did not likely affect the outcome of the case).  At the hearing, a\nspecial agent testified that she obtained GE 5 from one of Applicant\u2019s former employers who had\npulled it from her employment file.  Tr. at 64-66 and 89-90.  The special agent also testified that she\nrequested Applicant to log into the USAJobs.gov website to retrieve her resume.  Applicant did so\nand the resume on that website was identical to GE 5.  Tr. at 71-73 and 90.  The special agent\nadequately authenticated GE 5.  Additionally, Applicant authenticated GE 5 during her testimony.\nShe testified that GE 5 was a \u201cworking resume\u201d that \u201cwas not ready to be published\u201d and, after\nadvising her former employer it was not finished, she submitted it to them upon their demand.  Tr.\nat 117-120, 123-127, and 142.    \nThird, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge erred in admitting GE 7, a Government\nrequested psychological evaluation, over Applicant\u2019s objection that she did not have sufficient time\nto review it.  Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 7, however, was not based on her having insufficient time\nto review it but rather on the content of the evaluation.  Tr. at 19-20.  At the hearing, Applicant\nacknowledged that she received GE 7 in Department Counsel\u2019s discovery package.  Id. and 143.  The\ndiscovery package was mailed to Applicant more than 40 days before the hearing.  No assertion has\nbeen made that Applicant requested a continuance to either review or rebut GE 7.  Moreover, there\nis no basis for concluding that the admission of GE 7 into evidence denied Applicant of any\n1 When offered into evidence by the Government, an applicant\u2019s signed e-QIP is admissible under Federal Rule\nof Evidence 801(d)(2) among other reasons.    \n4\n\nprocedural due process rights afforded her under the Directive.  This assignment of error lacks merit. \nFourth, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that the Judge interfered with Applicant\u2019s right to\nmake objections.  Near the beginning of the hearing, the Judge advised Applicant \u201cAnytime you have\na problem, just ask the question because it\u2019s normally easily resolved.  Not all the time, but well,\nokay.\u201d  Tr. at 11.  Applicant\u2019s contention involves an objection that she made during the special\nagent\u2019s direct examination by Department Counsel.  When this objection was raised, the special\nagent was testifying about Applicant\u2019s explanations for her inaccurate e-QIP responses regarding her\neducational qualifications.  Applicant asked the Judge whether she could make an objection.  The\nJudge permitted her to object.  Applicant did not assert an actual objection to the special agent\u2019s\ntestimony but instead essentially began testifying about computer problems she encountered while\nworking on her e-QIP.  Tr. at 47-48.  The Judge then asked the special agent some questions based\non Applicant\u2019s comments.  During that exchange, Applicant interjected information about AE A, the\ne-QIP she completed the night before the hearing.  At the end of the exchange, the Judge advised\nApplicant that it would be better if she would write down her questions of the witness because she\nwould be given an opportunity to ask them.  Tr. at 47-50.  Based on this exchange, Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel argues \u201cthe Judge effectively muzzled the Applicant\u201d and \u201cencouraged the Applicant to not\nobject in the middle of damaging testimony.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 7 and 13.  We disagree with those\nassertions.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.10 provides the Judge \u201cshall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely,\nand orderly manner.\u201d  Within the parameters set forth in the Directive, the Judge has leeway on how\nhe or she conducts a hearing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00857 at 6, n.11 (App. Bd. May 8, 2019). \nThe Judge\u2019s statement to Applicant was appropriate guidance to help ensure the orderly presentation\nof testimony.  There is no basis for concluding that a reasonable person would have interpreted the\nJudge\u2019s guidance as somehow limiting or discouraging Applicant from making objections.\nFifth, Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends that Judge permitted the inclusion of inflammatory\ntestimony without providing Applicant notice.  This contention arises from Department Counsel\nasking the special agent on re-direct examination what Applicant was trying to gain when she\npurportedly stated she was an employee of the FBI at the VA medical clinic.  The special agent\nresponded by stating, \u201cfrom the reports there was something about pain pills that she had been\nprescribed.  She was trying to obtain a higher, a higher amount of pills because she was going to FBI\ntraining in Washington, D.C. for a month or so.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 8, quoting from Tr. at 86-87. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel notes no Guideline H allegations were brought against Applicant and argues\nthis was damaging and irrelevant testimony.  This argument is not persuasive.  The SOR alleged that\nApplicant had misrepresented herself as a FBI employee at the VA clinic.  What Applicant may have\nsaid or done during that incident were relevant lines of inquiry.  Rules governing the exclusion of\ninflammatory evidence are primarily designed for jury trials, and judges have latitude to rule on\nwhether evidence is so inflammatory that it might improperly prejudice the jury.  In DOHA\nproceedings, there is no jury.  DOHA Judges, as experienced professionals, are not presumed to be\neasily prejudiced by such evidence.  Also, Applicant never objected to this testimony, so any\npotential objection was forfeited.  Moreover, even if Applicant had made a request for additional\nmedication, such a request does not reflect any illegal or improper drug involvement.       \n  \nSufficiency of the Findings of Fact\n5\n\nA section of the appeal brief is entitled, \u201cFailures in Finding of Facts.\u201d  In that section,\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel makes a general claim that the Judge\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial\nevidence.  However, he fails to identify any specific finding of fact that is not based on substantial\nevidence.  The Appeal Board does not review a case de novo.  This assignment of error fails for lack\nof specificity.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03372 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018) (discussing the\nrationale for requiring an appealing party to raise specific claims of legal or factual error).\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also makes a general claim that the Judge failed to examine relevant\nevidence.  Again, he fails to identify any specific evidence the Judge purported failed to examine. \nThis assignment of error does not rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020).   \nWeighing the Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s remaining assignments of error amount to a disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  For example, he highlights three Hearing Office cases as\nexamples of applicants being granted security clearances in similar situations.  He also challenges\nthe Judge\u2019s credibility determination and whole-person assessment.  In this regard, we noted the U.S.\nSupreme Court has stated, \u201cDetermining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the special\nprovince of the trier of fact.\u201d  Inwood Laboratories, Inc., et al. v. Ives Laboratories Inc., et al., 456\nU.S. 844, 856 (1982). \nEach security clearance adjudication is unique and must be judged on it own merits.  See\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A\u00b6 2(b).  We gave due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has cited in support of his arguments, but they are neither binding precedent\non the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-\n01234 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2020).  The cited cases are easily distinguishable from the present\ncase.  Of note, the Judge in one of the cited cases concluded the applicant did not intentionally\nprovide false information about his academic record to employers.  \nAs noted above, the Judge concluded that none of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the alleged\nfalsifications were credible.  We are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  A party challenging a Judge\u2019s credibility determination has a heavy burden\non appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005).  Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nhas failed to identify any basis for us to call into question the Judge\u2019s credibility determination. \nFrom our review of the record, the arguments of Applicant\u2019s Counsel are not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01234 at 3.  We further conclude the\nJudge considered the totality of the evidence in compliance with the whole-person analysis\nrequirements.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). \n6\n\nBias\nIn the appeal brief, Applicant\u2019s Counsel stated, \u201cA review of the DOHA Hearing transcript,\nand the record at large, makes it abundantly clear the Judge had a negative perception of the\nApplicant from the moment the hearing began.\u201d   Appeal Brief at 12.  He further asserts:\n[T]he Judge effectively allowed the pro se Applicant to be bludgeoned into an\nextremely negative characterization by the Department Counsel.  In turn, this\nnegative characterization of the Applicant\u2019s credibility was adopted by the Judge\nresulting in an unfavorable decision.  While there may not be sufficient evidence to\nsatisfy the heavy burden of intentional bias by the Judge, it is clear that taken\ncollectively, the various errors cited resulted in a biased decision. [Appeal Brief at\n13.]\n \nOur review of the record reveals nothing that would persuade a reasonable person that the\nJudge lacked the requisite impartiality or conducted the hearing in an unfair manner.  Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel has not met the heavy burden of persuasion to rebut the presumption that the Judge was\nimpartial.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01513 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2020).  \nConclusion\nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

He attended college but did not obtain a degree.  He has held a security clearance since\nSeptember 2016.  Decision at 2.  Applicant was briefed by his various employers regarding the use\nof illegal drugs.\nApplicant admitted in his security clearance application (SCA) that he used marijuana,\ninfrequently,  from 2000 through mid-2018.  He obtained his first clearance in 2016.  Applicant was\naware that illegal drug use was forbidden.  He stated that his last use of marijuana was in 2018 in\ncelebration of his birthday.  Applicant has never tested positive for illegal drugs and presented a\nletter of intent not to use drugs in the future.  He claims that he has stopped associating with people\nwho use marijuana.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his admission to drug use in 2018 was not\ncorrect and that it should have been 2016.  In his hearing testimony, however, he stated that 2018\nwas indeed the correct date of his last drug use and that he had provided incorrect information in his\nAnswer due to nervousness.  In his clearance interview, he stated that he could not remember the\nnumber of times in which he used marijuana after having received a clearance.  In 2012, Applicant\nwas arrested for possession of marijuana.  The court dismissed the case after he completed\ncommunity service.  Applicant testified that his next use was in 2015 in a music studio.  He was\nworking for a contractor at the time and knew that the use of marijuana was against Federal law.  \nAfter he received the SOR, Applicant consulted a psychologist, whose report states that there\nis nothing in Applicant\u2019s character to dissuade a prospective employer from hiring him.  Applicant\ndescribes himself as a mature man who made a mistake.  He ventured that the decriminalization of\nmarijuana in his locality have influenced his conduct.  Applicant\u2019s character references describe him\nas honest and trustworthy, a good worker with sound judgment.  His evaluations laud his job\nperformance.  None of the persons who wrote the character letters appear to know about the\nmarijuana use.\n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge concluded the time that had elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last instance of misconduct\nwas too brief to establish rehabilitation.  She noted his consultation of a psychologist and that he no\nlonger associates with drug-using friends.  \u201cHowever, his ever-changing dates of use listed in his\nSCA and his answer provide me with great doubts about his veracity.\u201d  Decision at 5.  In the whole-\nperson analysis, the Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s excellent reputation among his friends and colleagues,\nhis lack of positive drug tests, and his psychological counseling.  She cited, however, to Applicant\u2019s\ninconsistent statements about the dates of his drug use and his admission in his interview that he\ncould not recall the number of times that he had used marijuana after having been cleared.  She\nstated that Applicant knew that marijuana use was not legal at the time of his misconduct and that\nhe had changed the dates of his use at the hearing.  \u201cHe tried to explain that he was confused because\nit was becoming decriminalized in [local jurisdiction]  I did not find his testimony credible, but\nrather self-serving.\u201d  Decision at 6.    \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contained errors and that the findings\nfailed to address significant record evidence, such as the number of times he has been tested for drug\nuse without a positive result.  We evaluate a Judge\u2019s findings of fact to see if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate\nto support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  See ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2019).    \nApplicant states that the Judge erred in finding that none of his character references were\naware of his security-significant conduct.  In fact, Applicant himself testified that none of these\npersons knew that he has ever used marijuana, which would appear to support the challenged\nfinding.  Tr. at 68.  However, one of the letters contained in Applicant Exhibit (AE) B2 states that\nApplicant had disclosed his marijuana use to the writer and another expressed awareness of\nApplicant\u2019s arrest for marijuana possession.  Another character reference, included in AE I, states\nthat the writer was not aware of anyone in Applicant\u2019s circle who uses marijuana, suggesting at least\nsome level of awareness of Applicant\u2019s security concerns.  Therefore, the challenged finding is\nerroneous.  However, it did not likely affect the outcome of the case and, therefore, is harmless.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02302 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2019).   \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he was a contractor at the time of his 2015\nmarijuana use.  There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s employer at this time was a Federal contractor. \nHe testified that it provided financial services to states and municipalities.  Tr. at 32.  However,\nApplicant also testified that this employer had an anti-drug policy and that he knew that marijuana\nuse was against Federal law.  Tr. at 81.  To the extent that there is an error in this finding, it is\nharmless.  After considering Applicant\u2019 arguments as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s  material\nfindings of security concern are supported by substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences\nthat could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 17-01680 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19,\n2019).   \n3\n\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s analysis of his evidence in mitigation.  He cites to a number\nof things that be contends the Judge did not address to the detriment of her analysis, such as his\nhaving candidly disclosed his marijuana use, his claim to have been confused over the extent to\nwhich his conduct was lawful in the jurisdiction where he resides, a comment in his clearance\ninterview summary that he is not subject to blackmail or coercion, etc.  He argues that the Judge\u2019s\nadverse decision rested on two points: first, that he did not have a firm recollection regarding the date\nof his marijuana use in the music studio and second, that the Judge found him to be lacking in\ncredibility.  Appeal Brief at 7.  He argues that these matters are not sufficient to support a clearance\ndenial.\nConcerning the comment in Applicant\u2019s interview summary, this represents Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the investigator\u2019s questions, not the investigator\u2019s considered opinion as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a clearance.  Even if an investigator offered such an opinion it would not bind DOHA\nin its evaluation of a case.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02158 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019). \nMoreover, while Applicant did contend that he was confused about the legal status of marijuana in\nhis place of residence, he otherwise testified unequivocally that he was aware that such conduct\nviolated Federal law.  Tr. at 84, 92.  \nOn the larger point regarding the basis for the Judge\u2019s overall decision, the gravamen of her\nanalysis was Applicant\u2019s having used marijuana for several years despite knowing its Federal\nillegality and its incompatibility with his employer\u2019s policies, and his having used it at least once\nafter having been granted a clearance/position of trust.  As he notes, the Judge also concluded that\nApplicant\u2019s presentation was lacking in credibility.  We give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  The Judge\u2019s comments that Applicant had made significantly\ninconsistent statements about his marijuana use are consistent with the record that was before her,\nand such statements can indeed impugn the credibility of a witness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03778 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2017).   Based upon our review of the entire record, we find no reason\nto disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  Applicant\u2019s arguments that the Judge did not\nconsider or that she mis-weighed certain pieces of evidence are not enough to rebut the presumption\nthat the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or to show that she weighed the evidence\nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01482\nat 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019).  \nApplicant argues that the Judge did not explicitly address the various whole person factors\nlisted in Directive, Encl. 2 App. A \u00b6 2(d).  However, a Judge is not required to discuss all of the\nanalytic factors set forth in the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02236 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2,\n2018).  Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis complied with the\nrequirements of the Directive in that she evaluated Applicant\u2019s case in light of the totality of the\nevidence.   ISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018).  We find no reason to conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation was erroneous.  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\n4\n\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Guideline B\nDIGEST: In Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, the presence\nof terrorist activity, and the intelligence gathering history of that government are important\nconsiderations that provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.  The country\u2019s human rights record is also an\nimportant consideration.  There is a rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a\nhostile country and the risk that the applicant might fail to protect and safeguard classified\ninformation.

Folks, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nLeon J. Schachter, Esq.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 17, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn April 29, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Marc Curry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department\nCounsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the mitigating conditions and whether he properly applied the whole-person concept,\nresulting in a decision that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we reverse.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born and raised in the Soviet Union, where he received his college and\ngraduate school education.  He came to the U.S. about twenty years ago and was naturalized a U.S.\ncitizen about six years later.  Applicant\u2019s wife was born in the Soviet Union but came to the U.S. in\nthe mid-1990s to live with her father, also a Soviet emigre.  Applicant\u2019s wife attended college in this\ncountry.  She and Applicant married about twenty years ago.\nApplicant and his wife have two minor children.  Though both were born in the U.S., the\nolder child has dual citizenship acquired to facilitate travel to Russia along with Applicant and his\nspouse.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Russia.  Retired, she receives a pension of\nabout $1,000 a month.  Though she has held resident alien status with the U.S., she stopped traveling\nto this country in about 2015 due to health concerns.  Applicant communicates with his mother about\nonce a week.\nApplicant has a half-sibling who is a citizen and resident of Russia.  The sibling owns a\ncompany in Russia.  In the late 2000s, Applicant\u2019s sibling moved to the U.S. on an investment visa. \nApplicant and the sibling purchased two gas stations in hopes of generating income.  The sibling\ndecided not to remain in the U.S., however, due to a delay in securing approval of a \u201cgreen card.\u201d \nThe sibling wired Applicant \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d during their business relationship. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with the sibling has been deteriorating over time.  He last saw the sibling on\n2019 while attending his father\u2019s funeral.  Applicant communicates with the sibling generally\nthrough text messages, though they talk on the phone two or three times a year.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law was granted political asylum in the U.S. due to Soviet religious\n\npersecution.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law came to the U.S. a few years after her husband and was\nnaturalized a few years ago. Applicant has several acquaintances in Russia with whom he\ncommunicates in frequently.  All of Applicant\u2019s close friends live in the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s home in the U.S. is valued at about $430,000 and he has cash savings of about\n$40,000.  He is active in his community, coaching soccer and serving on the board of directors of\nhis homeowner\u2019s association.  Applicant enjoys an outstanding reputation for the quality of his work\nperformance.  One witness stated that Applicant \u201cputs our nation above everything else.\u201d  Decision\nat 4.\nRussia poses a significant cyber-espionage threat against the U.S.  It\u2019s interference with the\nU.S. presidential election in 2016 is the most recent incident of its longstanding desire to undermine\nthe U.S.-led liberal order.  This was a \u201csignificant escalation of past attempts to influence U.S.\nelections.\u201d  Russia has an \u201cabysmal human rights record,\u201d which includes extrajudicial killings,\narbitrary arrest, torture, and suppression of the media.  Decision at 4-5.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother and sibling satisfy the\ncriteria of disqualifying condition 7(a): \n[C]ontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(a).\nIn drawing this conclusion, the Judge cited to Official Notice documents to the effect that Russia\nseeks to expand its influence worldwide through any means necessary, including espionage,\ncyberattacks, and interference in foreign elections.  He stated that as \u201ca repressive, autocratic country\nthat conducts more espionage against the United States than nearly every country in the world, it is\naxiomatic that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Russian family members poses a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, [etc].\u201d  Decision at 6. \nThe Judge also concluded, however, that Applicant had established the criteria of mitigating\ncondition 8(b): \n[T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government or country\nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 8(b).  \nHe stated that the heightened risk inherent in Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives is mitigated by the \u201cdeep,\nlongstanding ties Applicant has cultivated in the United States since immigrating 20 years ago, his\n\ncultural integration into his community, as exemplified by his soccer coaching and service on the\nhomeowner\u2019s association, and his many friends, financial ties, and the professional goodwill that he\nhas earned during his career.  Decision at 6.\nDiscussion  \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure\n2 \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nIn Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, the presence of\nterrorist activity, and the intelligence gathering history of that government are important\nconsiderations that provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.  The country\u2019s human rights record is also an important\nconsideration.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019); ISCR Case No. 15-\n00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017).  There is a rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family\nties in a hostile country and the risk that the applicant might fail to protect and safeguard classified\ninformation.  Whether or not actively hostile actions, such as military conflict, have broken out or\nare imminent, any country whose policies consistently threaten U.S. national security may be viewed\nas hostile for purpose of DOHA adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5.  The\nSupreme Court has explicitly cited family members in a hostile country as a reason to deny an\napplicant a security clearance.  Egan, supra, at 529 .  Accordingly, we have long held that such\napplicants have a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d of persuasion to show that connections in a hostile country\ndo not pose a threat to U.S. security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5; ISCR Case No. 09-\n08099 at 2  (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2012); and ISCR Case No. 10-09986 at 3  (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2011). \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions run contrary to the greater\nweight of the record evidence.  We find Department Counsel\u2019s arguments to be persuasive.  We note\nthe following, drawn from the Judge\u2019s findings and/or from the record evidence.\n1.  Russia is a major practitioner of cyber-espionage against the U.S.  It seeks to exert\n\ninfluence on U.S. elections, for example, in an effort to undermine U.S. strategic\ngoals.  Decision at 4.   \n2.  Terrorist groups plot attacks within Russia and may bring such plots to fruition\nat any moment.  U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory, Included in Hearing\nExhibit (HE) I.  \n3.  Telephone and electronic communications are subject to surveillance at any time\nwithout notice.  The Russian System for Operational-Investigative Activities permits\nauthorities to monitor and record all data that traverses Russia\u2019s networks.  Crime\nand Safety Report, Included in HE I.   \n4.  Applicant\u2019s mother and sibling are citizens and residents of Russia.  Decision at\n2-3.\n5.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with these two relatives is not casual.  He speaks with his\nmother weekly.  Moreover, he testified that, though he speaks with his sibling only\nonce or twice a year, he communicates with this relative more frequently by text\nmessaging.  Applicant and his sibling planned to go into business together in the U.S. \nThough this project fell through, the sibling gave Applicant several thousand dollars\nin furtherance of their business plans.  Decision at 3-4; Tr. at 49.\n6.  Applicant\u2019s mother receives a pension through the Russian government.  Tr. at\n66-67.\nAlthough the Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a heightened risk\nof coercion, his mitigation analysis failed to explain how things such as Applicant\u2019s excellent job\nperformance, his coaching activities, and his service on his HOA meet his very heavy burden of\npersuasion.  Tellingly, and as Department Counsel notes, the Judge did not explicitly mention the\nthis burden, which significantly impairs his overall favorable decision.  \nA Guideline B adjudication is not a judgment on an applicant\u2019s character or loyalty to the\nU.S.  Rather, it is a determination as to whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances foreseeably pose a risk\nof compromise.  Of course, no one\u2019s future conduct can be predicted with certitude.  Even a person\nof the highest character can experience circumstances under which he or she could be tempted to\nplace the well-being of foreign relatives over the interests of the U.S.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n04208 at 5. The Judge applied mitigating conditions 8(b), which was erroneously cited as 20(b), and \n8(c) (\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\u201d) which was erroneously\ncited as 8(d).  The Judge\u2019s application of 8(c) is simply not consonant with the fact that Applicant\u2019s\nRussian contacts are family, including three members of his immediate family.  Simply put they are\nnot casual contacts.  The Judge\u2019s conclusions under 8(b) are not sustainable given the circumstances\nin Russia, that country\u2019s approach to the U.S. and American interests, and the nature of his family\ncontacts with Russians , including persons residing in Russia.  DOHA can only draw conclusions\nfrom the available evidence, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that security clearance\n\nadjudications are \u201can inexact science at best.\u201d  Egan, supra, at 529.  \nAccordingly, in light of record evidence of Russia\u2019s history of espionage against the U.S.,\nits deliberate and significant intrusions into U.S. elections, and its monitoring of electronic and\ntelephonic communications, it is foreseeable that Applicant\u2019s ongoing relationship with his relatives\ncould be means through which he comes to the attention of Russian authorities charged with\nuncovering U.S. classified or protected information and subjected to the kind of pressure or coercion\nthat a clearance adjudication seeks to avoid.   Moreover, it is not reasonable to conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s character evidence and community involvement provide a clear insight into how he\nmight react under such a circumstance.  \n  \nWe note the argument in Applicant\u2019s reply brief to the effect that the \u201cheightened risk\u201d\nstandard is vague to the point of unconstitutionality.  He made that same argument in the hearing,\nwhere he urged a similar argument about the Egan standard. Tr. at 6 et seq.  It is axiomatic that\nDOHA has no jurisdiction to rule on constitutional issues or on the wisdom of the provisions of the\nDirective.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-05344 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 3, 2010).  We have held that\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d is not a high standard for the Government to meet, defining it as a risk \u201cgreater\nthan the normal risk inherent in having a family member living in a foreign country.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019).  Insofar as Applicant has not cross appealed, however,\nthe question of whether he received the due process afforded by the Directive is not before us.  \nWe conclude that, given the risks inherent in Applicant\u2019s foreign connections, his evidence\nin mitigation is not sufficient to meet the very heavy burden of persuasion, viewed in light of the\nmitigating conditions and the whole-person concept.

He states that he was working on a contract that was supposed to continue\nbut ended abruptly.  He argues the Judge\u2019s purported error weighed heavily in his decision.  \nWe examine a Judge\u2019s findings to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, that is,\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-02145 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  In his background interview, Applicant stated that his\nfinancial problems began in 2013 because of debts from his wedding, moving from State A to State\nB, two months of unemployment, a pay cut of $40,000 due to the move, and expenses related to his\nchildren.  Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 2.  In his security clearance application, Applicant listed\nhis reason for leaving the job in question as: \u201cLooked for a job in [State B].  Didn\u2019t want to stay in\n[State A] anymore.\u201d  GE 1 at 16.  At the hearing, Applicant testified as follows:\n   \n[Applicant]:  . . .  I ended up having a really great position with that company and it\njust didn\u2019t work out between me and the existing personnel, so I took a position here\nin [State B].  We moved out here, but it was about 40 or so thousand difference in\npay, so I took a pretty big hit coming out here because at the time -- [Tr. at 19-20.]\n*  *  *\n[Department Counsel]:  And when you moved out, made a decision to move, did you\never consider how it affected your finance?  Because I believe you said like you\n[took] a $40,000 hit?\n[Applicant]:  I did.  It was -- it was rough, and I knew it was going to affect finances,\nbut again, you know, I was like I\u2019ll get out there.  I\u2019ll get my foot in the door, and\nthen I\u2019ll get a position.\n[Department Counsel]:  And what was the reason besides -- what was the reason\nbehind the move?\n2\n\n[Applicant]:   The move, it clearly was work related.\n[Department Counsel]:  Did you have a job out here you were taking? \n[Applicant]:   Right, exactly.\n[Department Counsel]:   Okay.\n[Applicant]:   It was -- I had the current position, the contract was kind of failing\nthrough, it was getting a little scary, so I was like all right, I need to make a move,\nand I had to get out of [State A].  I just didn\u2019t care for it all that much.\n[Department Counsel]:   And I live not too far from where you\u2019re saying, [location],\nI would imagine, is a lot more expensive than where you are here, [State B]?\n[Applicant]:   Yeah, very, very much so.\n[Department Counsel]:  Okay.  I have no further questions. [Tr. at 43-44.]\nBased on our review of the record, we conclude the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions that\nApplicant\u2019s decision to leave the job in question was voluntary are based on substantial evidence or\nconstitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the way in which the\nJudge weighed the evidence.  He argues, for example, that his financial situation has greatly\nimproved, he is living within his means, and he is paying his delinquent debts.   He also notes  that\nhe started a debt relief program before the security clearance proceeding began.  His arguments are\nneither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record\nnor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He served in the military,\nincluding in Afghanistan, and received an honorable discharge.  He has earned an associate\u2019s degree. \nHe is single and has a child.  He was granted a security clearance in 2008.  He attributed his financial\nproblems to periods of unemployment, mistakes in the past, and having to make child support\npayments. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has four delinquent debts (two vehicle repossessions, a\nstudent loan, and a credit card account) totaling over $25,000.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted the two delinquent vehicle loans and stated he was working with the creditors on repayment\noptions.  He denied the student loan, indicating he initially thought it was resolved through tax\nrefund withholdings, later learned it had an $800 balance, and stated he would work with the creditor\nto pay it.  He denied the credit card debt, claiming he paid a negotiated settlement amount, and\nfurnishing a confirmation number for that payment.  He provided no documentation confirming\npayments or other efforts to resolve the delinquent debts.  In the File of Relevant Material (FORM),\nDepartment Counsel highlighted the lack of documentation supporting Applicant\u2019s contentions. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM.  Despite his delinquent debts, Applicant took a personal\ntrip outside the United States in 2015.  \u201cApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances\ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\u201d  Decision at 8.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains new evidence, i.e., assertions and an email string of\nmessages that are not contained in the record.  His arguments that he started to resolve his delinquent\ndebts before he was placed on notice that his security clearance eligibility was in jeopardy and that\nthe Judge erred in finding or concluding that he did not receive financial counseling or did not have\na budget are primarily based on new evidence that we cannot consider.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April\n15, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant initially requested a\ndecision on the written record but later requested a hearing.  On November 26, 2019, after the\nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises a due process issue.  He is contending essentially that he was\nnot notified the record closed and believed he would have the opportunity to submit additional\nmatters before the Judge issued the decision.  For reasons stated below, we remand the decision to\nthe Judge.\nAt the hearing held on September 25, 2019, the Judge indicated that Applicant requested to\npostpone the hearing until mid-October.  The Judge denied the postponement request but noted that,\nif necessary, he would hold the record open until October 18th to provide Applicant the opportunity\nto submit additional documentary evidence on ongoing actions involving his debts.  Tr. at 7-8.  The\nJudge also advised Applicant that, if upon completion of the ongoing debt actions, he wanted to\ncontinue a live, in-person hearing he could request the hearing be reopened.  Id. at 8-9.   The Judge\nstated, \u201cWhether or not we need to reconvene this hearing will be determined after we complete as\nfar as we can today.\u201d  Id. at 9.   During his testimony, Applicant indicated that the defense contract \non which he was working had been awarded to a new company, and he did not know whether the\nnew contractor would offer him a job.  Tr. at 47-48.  Later in the hearing, the following occurred:\n[Judge]:  . . .  I\u2019m not going to adjust the record opening [sic] date.  I\u2019m going to\nleave it at October 18 realizing that we may have to extend that a bit longer just\ndepending on what happens during the month of October.  [Tr. at 75.] \n*   *   *\n[Judge]:  Okay.  [Applicant], you mentioned character statements.  If during the\nperiod where the record is open, the 18th, you wish to submit testimonials to your\ngood character, trustworthiness, job performance, you can add those to the list of\ndocuments to be submitted.  That\u2019s discretionary, it\u2019s up to you, but if you want to\ndo it I will accept them and consider them.\n[Applicant]:  Okay.  Thank you.\n[Judge]:  Okay.  So we\u2019re going to hold the record open until 18th of October.  And\non that date we\u2019ll review the -- see what we have.\n2\n\nI may close the record on that date.  I have indicated that I would entertain a\nmotion to reopen the hearing, but the burden would be on you, [Applicant], to\nconvince me that it\u2019s necessary and that the documents don\u2019t speak for themselves.\nSo at some point in October we\u2019re going to come to closure on this and I\u2019m\ngoing to have as complete as record as we have.  And I\u2019ll sit down and write my\nwritten decision and that will be mailed to you. \n[Applicant]:  Okay.  [Tr. at 84-85.]  \n  \nIn the decision, the Judge stated that he kept the record open until October 18, 2019, and\ninformed Applicant that he would entertain a request to reopen the record if any documents\nsubmitted were not self-explanatory.  The Judge also noted that Applicant did not submit any\nadditional documentary evidence or request that the hearing be reopened. \nIn the appeal brief, Applicant contends that he sent the Judge an email on October 18, 2019,\n\u201cstating [he] was still unemployed and will be in touch with him once [he] was working again\u201d and\nnoted his debts were deferred while he was unemployed.  Appeal Brief at 1.  He also stated that,\n\u201cSince then, there [have] been no communications from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nand I made the assumption that a judgement was made to leave the case open due to my\nunemployment.\u201d  Id.   In general, assertions and documents that are not in the record constitute new\nevidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However, we\nmay consider new evidence in examining a due process issue.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00812\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul 8, 2015).  Applicant\u2019s purported email of October 18th is not contained in the\nrecord or in the parties\u2019 briefs.  Of note, a Judge is required to prepare a full and complete record.\nSee Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.19 and E3.1.29.  Failure to create or preserve a complete record is error and\ncan impair our ability to perform our review function.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08257 at 5 (App.\nBd. Feb. 8, 2007).  Department Counsel\u2019s Reply Brief, however, does contain an email the Judge\nsent to Department Counsel on November 20, 2019, stating, \u201cI kept the record in this case open until\nOctober 18.  I have not received anything from Applicant, except for an email telling me that he was\nlooking for another job.  Have you received anything?\u201d  Department Counsel responded in the\nnegative.   \nBased on the foregoing, Applicant reasonably believed the record would remain open until\nOctober 18, 2019, and a review would be conducted on that date to determine whether it should\nremain open for a longer period.  Applicant was not definitively informed the record would close on\nOctober 18th.  Applicant reports that he sent the Judge an email on October 18th, indicated he did not\nreceive a response to his email, and assumed the record would be left open while he was\nunemployed.  We recognize that Applicant should have contacted the Judge after sending his email\nto confirm whether the Judge decided to leave the record open for a longer period.  However,\nwithout having an opportunity to review Applicant\u2019s email of October 18th, we cannot conclude\nApplicant\u2019s assumption that record would remain open was unfounded or unreasonable.  Given these\ncircumstances, we conclude the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge to determine\nwhat occurred on October 18th and then take whatever action is appropriate in accordance with the\nDirective.\n3\n\nOrder\nThe case is REMANDED.   \nSigned: Michael Y.

In\nthe Remand Decision of March 3, 2020, the Judge added Applicant\u2019s email of October 18, 2019 to\nthe record.  This email merely updated the Judge on Applicant\u2019s unemployment status.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph D. Jordan, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n24, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 26, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  The Judge\nmade an amendment to a typographical error in her decision on March 31, 2020.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant falsified his security clearance application (SCA) and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under\nGuideline F were not raised as an issue on appeal.  Consistent with the following, we remand.\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified a security clearance application\n(SCA) in 2016 by responding in the negative to questions that asked whether he had been arrested\nor cited to appear in a criminal proceeding in the past seven years, whether he had ever been charged\nwith a felony or an offense involving alcohol or drugs, and whether he illegally used any controlled\nsubstances in the past seven years.  Applicant explained that he was not good with computers and\nasked his sister to assist him in completing the SCA.  They worked on the SCA in the middle of the\nnight after he returned home from work.  He assumed his sister inputted the correct information, but\nnow realizes he should have checked the responses before signing it.  The Judge found against\nApplicant on the three falsification allegations.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asserts that he did not have any intent to falsify his SCA.  In\nthe decision, the Judge noted the potential application of one Guideline E disqualifying condition,\nthat is, Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities[.]\u201d  The\nJudge did not specifically find or conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) applied in this case.  Her Guideline E\nanalysis consists of the following:\nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Even though Applicant did\nnot input the information himself on his security clearance application, he has the\nduty and responsibility to ensure that the information provided to the Government is\naccurate and truthful to the best of his ability.  Applicant\u2019s sister electronically\ninputted the information and Applicant should have checked and reviewed what she\ninputted to ensure its accuracy.  Applicant was careless and did not take the process\nseriously.  He signed the document and in doing so attested to its truthfulness. \nApplicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d to questions on his security clearance questionnaire\nconcerning his police record, and illegal drug abuse, which he should clearly have\nadmitted.  There is no excuse for this dishonesty or carelessness and clearly calls his\n2\n\ncharacter into question.  In either case, considered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct\nprecludes a finding of good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  To be\nentrusted with the privilege of holding a security clearance, one is expected to be\nhonest and truthful at all times, and to know and understand the rules and regulations\nthat apply to them, and to always abide by those rules.  Under the particular facts of\nthis case, Applicant has not demonstrated this awareness.  By failing to answer these\nquestions correctly on the security clearance application, his conduct does not show\nhonesty, integrity, good judgment or reliability.  At this time, Applicant does not\nmeet the qualifications for access to classified information.  Accordingly, the\npersonal conduct security concern has not been mitigated.  This guideline is found\nagainst Applicant.  [Decision at 8-9.]\nAs a general principle, a Judge is tasked to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014).  Moreover, a Judge\u2019s decision must\nbe written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to discern what findings the Judge is\nmaking and what conclusions he or she is reaching.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 23, 2018). \nThe Judge essentially concluded that Applicant\u2019s SCA responses in question were either the\nresults of dishonesty or negligence.  Such a conclusion is not sufficient to establish deliberate\nfalsification.  AG \u00b6 16(a) requires the Judge to conclude that there was a \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts . . . .\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 16(a) (emphasis\nadded).  Carelessness does not equate to a deliberate falsification.  In this case, the Judge failed to\nresolve an apparent conflict in the evidence, i.e., whether Applicant\u2019s incorrect SCA responses were\nthe result of a deliberate  falsification or carelessness.  It is unfair for a Judge to make formal\nfindings that an applicant deliberately falsified responses in a SCA when his or her conduct may\nhave only amounted to carelessness.  As written, the Judge\u2019s decision is not sustainable.\n   \nWe recognize the Directive provides that \u201cany failure . . . to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during national security investigative  . . . processes\u201d can raise questions about a person\u2019s\neligibility for a clearance.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A\u00b6 15 (emphasis added).  While the Guideline\nE disqualifying conditions do not specifically list negligence in completing a SCA as conduct that\ncould raise disqualifying security concerns, the language of AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by\nitself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information[,]\u201d sufficiently \nencompasses forms of negligent behavior.  Whether negligence in completing a SCA creates a\nsecurity concern depends on the facts of a case.  For example, a simple misreading of a SCA\nquestion or a minor omission resulting from an oversight may not rise to the level to create security\nconcerns.  On the other hand, failure to exercise reasonable care in responding to questions during\na clearance investigation may raise such concerns.  Each case must be judged on its own facts. \nDirective \u00b6 Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).\n3\n\nIn this case, the SOR alleged only deliberate falsifications and was not amended at the\nhearing to address other forms of failure to provide truthful information.  Applicant was not placed\non notice that carelessness or recklessness in completing the SCA raised security concerns that could\npossibly result in denial of national security eligibility.  As the Board has previously stated, the SOR\nshould be easily amended so that a case is adjudicated on the merits of relevant issues.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-02952 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).  The SOR may be amended on remand. \nId. at 4.\n  \nAccordingly, we remand this case for further proceedings in accordance with the Directive. \n4\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan         \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

About two years later,\nhe left Iraq again and then lived in a couple of Middle Eastern countries before immigrating to the\nUnited States in the late 2000s.  He became a U.S. citizen about six years ago.  About three years\nago, he traveled to Iraq on an Iraqi passport to marry an Iraqi woman.  She is now a permanent U.S.\nresident.  They have a child who was born in the United States.  He has relinquished his Iraqi\npassport and expressed a willingness to renounce his Iraqi citizenship.  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and one sibling are naturalized U.S. citizens.  His father is a retired Iraqi\nGovernment official.  His parents left Iraq to avoid risks coming from a prior regime.  He has two\nother siblings who reside in the U.S. but have not yet become U.S. permanent residents.   \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has family and associates who are citizens and residents of\nIraq.  They include his wife, mother-in-law, father-in-law who is a former senior official in the Iraqi\nGovernment, two siblings-in-law, and extended family members and associates, some of whom\neither are serving or have served in the Iraqi Government or military.  In responding to the SOR, he\nadmitted all of the allegations with explanations.   One of his associates is a retired pilot in the Iraqi\nair force.  Applicant indicated that he has ended all contact with extended family members and\nassociates in 2018 due to security concerns arising from his employment in support of the U.S.\nmilitary.    \nInstability persists in parts of Iraq.  Terrorist groups, insurgents, and militias fuel these\nconditions.  U.S. citizens are at high risk of kidnaping and terrorist violence in Iraq.  Widespread\ncorruption and significant human rights violations also occur there.    \nApplicant has numerous relatives in Iraq, some of whom have connections to the Iraqi\nGovernment.  His relationships in Iraq are not casual.  His wife has regular contact with her parents\nand siblings.  Despite his claim that he does not have contact with his wife\u2019s family, Applicant has\nnot rebutted the presumption that he has a close relationship to them.  He has experienced threats of\nphysical violence from factions in Iraq.  \u201cAlthough his sense of loyalty to the United States is\n2\n\nsignificant, that information is not sufficient to outweigh the heightened risk of coercion presented\nby the presence of his extended family, his wife\u2019s family, and other associates in Iraq.\u201d  Decision at\n7-8.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the allegation concerning his wife and against him\non the other allegations.  \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, mis-\nweighed the evidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person\nconcept.  In his arguments, he highlights, for example, that he has not spoken to his extended family\nin Iraq since 2018, that he has relinquished his Iraqi passport, that he renounced his Iraqi citizenship,1\nand that he has earned a master\u2019s degree from a university in the United States.  The Judge, however,\naddressed most of those matters in his decision.  Applicant\u2019s arguments are neither enough to rebut\nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-01717 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2017).  We give due consideration to the Hearing\nOffice cases that Applicant has cited in support of his arguments, but they are neither binding\nprecedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id.  We further\nconclude the Judge considered the totality of the evidence in compliance with the whole-person\nanalysis requirements.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning\npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor  of the\nnational security.\u201d\n1  When asked at the hearing if he had a valid Iraqi passport, Applicant stated, \u201cI renounced it, sir.\u201d  Tr. at 26. \nWhen questioned about how he renounced his Iraqi citizenship during cross-examination, he stated that he turned over\nhis Iraqi passport to his facility security officer.  Tr. at 45-46.  No proof was offered that Applicant renounced his Iraqi\ncitizenship before Iraqi Government officials.  \n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 15, 2019, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Gregg A. Cervi denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E have not\nbeen raised as an issue on appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in her late 50s, is an employee of a defense contractor.  She and her\nhusband have inconsistent work histories.  Her husband was injured while serving in the military and\nin a civilian job and receives disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Social\nSecurity.  He also had a ride-share business that failed.  She expended time and money to assist her\nelderly mother and also experienced a five-month period of unemployment in 2015.

She admitted the\nbankruptcy allegations but denied the vehicle loan allegation.  \nThe first bankruptcy discharged about $20,000 in consumer debt, the second bankruptcy\ndischarged about $141,866 in unsecured claims without payment, and the third bankruptcy\ndischarged about $241,800 in debts and also resulted in the abandonment of about $80,000 in assets. \nThe alleged vehicle loan became delinquent in 2016.  In late 2016, she began making agreed monthly\npayments of $530 on the vehicle loan but fell behind on them when she began making partial,\nirregular payments starting in July 2017.  In May 2019, she made a payment of about $7,200 to bring\nthe account current and resumed the monthly payments.        \nIn 2019, Applicant and her husband took a vacation and entered into a timeshare agreement. \nThey later learned that the timeshare had a negative effect on their credit and generated unexpected\ncharges.  They drafted a letter to the timeshare company to be relieved of their obligation, but the\ncurrent status of the account and whether the letter was delivered is unknown.  \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant experienced conditions beyond her control, but failed to establish a track record\nof making responsible financial decisions.  Some mitigating conditions are partially applicable but\nare not conclusive.  The evidence does not establish convincingly that Applicant will not incur future\ndelinquencies or that she has the intent and means to resolve her debts.  Her financial history\ncontinues to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n  \nDiscussion\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant states:\nWhen my husband and I sat before the Administrative Judge (Judge) he was\ndesignated as my [personal] representative.  Opposing counsel stated that he wanted\nto ask me a few clarifying questions.  . . .  I kept telling the judge that the questions\nhe was asking were to be answered by my husband.  When my husband would\nattempt to give the specific information as to dates, amounts, and specific facts about\nthe case the judge would tell him that he could not help me answer the question.  So,\nthere were some issues that did not reflect the true facts of the case. [Appeal Brief at\n1.]\nDirective \u00b6 6.2 provides that \u201c[a]n applicant is required to give . . . full, frank, and truthful answers\nto relevant and material questions needed by DOHA to reach a clearance decision\u201d and refusal or\nfailure to do so may prevent DOHA from making a clearance decision.  At a hearing, a Judge may\ndirect an applicant to answer relevant questions.  Applicant\u2019s husband did testify after Applicant at\nthe hearing.  The Judge explained to Applicant that she could just say she does not know the answer\nwhen that is the case but that he would not allow her husband to testify through her.  Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that the Judge instructed her to answer questions, instead of letting her husband answer\nthem, fails to establish any error.     \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains assertions and a document that are not contained in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive\nE3.1.29.   \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in finding that she had $28,000 in non-alleged student\nloans.  She states that her student loans total $2,800.  Credit reports in the record support her claim. \nThe Judge\u2019s error regarding the amount of Applicant\u2019s student loans, however, was harmless because\nit did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.\n25, 2013).  Applicant also disputes that the alleged vehicle loan was placed for collection with a\ncollection agency.  Although a credit report (Government Exhibit 6 at 1) reflects the vehicle loan was\na collection account, it does not indicate a collection agency was involved.  Applicant\u2019s dispute is\napparently based on the Judge\u2019s comment in his analysis that she was making payments on the\nvehicle loan pursuant to \u201c a repayment plan offered by the collection agent[.]\u201d  Decision at 6.  We\nrecognize that the Judge could have been referring to an employee of the creditor in using the term\n3\n\n\u201ccollection agent.\u201d  Even if the Judge erred by using that term, it did not likely affect the outcome\nof the case.  Id.   \nSome of Applicant\u2019s assignments of error fall outside the scope of our review.  For example,\nApplicant disputes that the vehicle loan was charged off.  Appeal Brief at 2, 4, and 5.  The Judge,\nhowever, did not make findings of fact or reach conclusions that the vehicle loan was charged off. \nOur scope of review is limited to determining whether the Judge committed certain harmful errors. \nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.  Applicant\u2019s contention regarding the vehicle loan being charged off fails\nto raise any harmful error by the Judge.  Applicant also notes the Judge\u2019s adverse decision has caused\na large reduction in her income.  The Directive, however, does not permit us to consider the impact\nof an unfavorable decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04202 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 24, 2015). \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a challenge to the way in which the Judge\nweighed the evidence.  Her arguments are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). \n \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April\n26, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On September 23, 2019, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nGina L. Marine granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  In the appeal brief, Department Counsel challenges\nan evidentiary ruling.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 12 delinquent accounts that were either charged off or\nplaced for collection.  Excluding a duplicate debt, the delinquent debts totaled about $39,600.  In the\nappeal brief, Department Counsel indicated that the Government agrees with, and adopts, the Judge\u2019s\nfinding of fact.  In her analysis, the Judge stated:    \nIn 2017, Applicant made monthly payments of $300 directly to the creditor\nto reduce the balance of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c from $6,870 to $3,172.  In\nApril 2018, she engaged the services of the DRP [debt relief program] to assist in\nresolving her delinquent debts, including those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.f.  In\nJanuary 2019, she hired a company to help monitor her credit for fraudulent activity. \nFrom April 2018 through August 2019, Applicant and her husband made bi-weekly\ndeposits of $347 into the DRP savings account, totaling approximately $12,716. \nBetween May 2019 and August 2019, Applicant resolved, directly with the creditors,\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g - 1.k, which totaled $1,743. The DRP negotiated\nsettlement agreements in August 2019 for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e to\nbe paid from DRP funds.  \nApplicant has established a reasonable plan to resolve her remaining\ndelinquent debts by continuing to work with the DRP, and by using a portion of the\nequity from the September 2019 sale of her home.  While Applicant is not currently\ndebt-free, her actions, both before and after the SOR was issued, demonstrate that she\nwill follow through her plan. [Decision at 6]\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are unlikely to recur and she is managing\nher current finances responsibly.  Department Counsel does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.\nIn the appeal brief, Department Counsel contends that the Judge erred in an evidentiary\nruling.  In the decision, the Judge stated:\nThe Government included a summary of Applicant\u2019s security clearance\ninterview (Item 4) among the evidentiary items in the FORM [File of Relevant\nMaterial].  The Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising\n2\n\nApplicant of her right to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on the ground that it\nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.  The Government did not,\nhowever, advise Applicant of the consequences of her failure to raise an objection to\nItem 4 in her responses to the FORM: specifically, that she could be considered to\nhave waived any such objection; and that Item 4 could be considered as evidence in\nher case.  Applicant did not raise an objection to Item 4 in either FORM response.\nHowever, because she was not advised that Item 4 could be considered as evidence\nabsent her objection, Item 4 is admitted only for the limited purpose of considering\nany mitigating or excuplatory information therein.  I will not consider any\ndisqualifying or derogatory information contained in Item 4 that is not corroborated\nby admissible evidence. [Decision at 2.]\nDepartment Counsel contends the Judge\u2019s sua sponte ruling regarding Applicant\u2019s\nbackground interview deprived the Government of an impartial decision-maker.  However, there is\na rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that\npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 15-03162 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 25, 2017).  This assignment of error is resolved against the Government because Department\nCounsel\u2019s arguments fail to meet the heavy burden of establishing the Judge was biased.  Adverse\nrulings alone do not demonstrate judicial bias.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd.\nNov. 8, 2017).\nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge\u2019s consideration of Applicant\u2019s\nunauthenticated background interview for the limited purpose of mitigation, while excluding any\nuncorroborated derogatory facts, was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We agree, although\nnot for all of the reasons set forth by Department Counsel.  \nWe review a Judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether they are arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).  In this case,\nthe Judge failed to articulate a satisfactory legal basis for her challenged ruling.  She needed to\nconclude whether or not the background interview was admissible.1  She cites no authority for her\nconclusion that information in a background interview admitted into evidence could be considered\nfor mitigating purposes but excluded from consideration for disqualifying purposes.2  She did not\n1 Department Counsel asserts, \u201cWhile the statement in the present case was not specifically adopted, Applicant\nraised no objection to it becoming part of the record, and thus, not only was it admissible based on the waived objection,\nbut the waiver was tantamount to an adoption.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 11.  The Board has never reached such a conclusion,\nand we decline to do so now.  Each case is different.  Whether a forfeiture of a right has occurred or whether a knowing\nand intelligent waiver has been made are determinations to be made by the Judge.  Department Counsel has tools\navailable to facilitate resolution and clarity in these situations.  It is worth observing that there is a spectrum of\neducational backgrounds among applicants and few are represented by counsel in FORM cases. \n2 The Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) authorize the admission of evidence for limited purposes in certain\ncircumstances.  See, e.g., FRE 105 (Limited Admissibility); FRE 404 (Character Evidence Not Admissible to Prove\nConduct; Exception Other Crimes); FRE 610 (Religious Beliefs and Opinions); etc.  However, there is no basis for\nconcluding any of the recognized circumstances for admitting evidence for limited purposes apply in this case.  Compare\n3\n\nspecifically identify what information in the background interview she was excluding from\nconsideration.3  Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(a) provides that \u201cAll available, reliable information\nabout the person, past or present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a\nnational security eligibility determination.\u201d  See also  Directive \u00b6 6.3 (\u201cEach clearance must be a fair\nand impartial common sense determination of all the relevant and material information . . .\u201d ); ISCR\nCase No. 14-06653 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 18, 2016)(a Judge must consider the evidence as a totality);\nand ISCR Case No. 94-0964 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996)(\u201cSecurity clearance decisions must be\nbased on consideration of the evidence as a whole, not just those pieces of evidence that support a\nJudge\u2019s final decision.\u201d).  Once the background interview was admitted into the record, it should\nhave been considered for all pertinent purposes.  It was arbitrary and capricious to exclude\nderogatory information in the background interview from being considered for disqualifying\npurposes.  The Judge\u2019s challenged evidentiary ruling is a clear error in judgment4 and contrary to\nlaw.5  \nIf an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider\nwhether the error was harmful or harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug.\n8, 2005).  As noted above, Department Counsel has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact or conclusions.  Department Counsel has not identified any derogatory information in the\nbackground interview possibly excluded from consideration that would have likely affected the\noutcome of the case.  Nor is it apparent to us that had the Judge considered all of the potentially\nderogatory information in the background interview she would have reached a different result.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0495 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 1996) (remand or reversal required only where\nthere is a significant chance that, but for the error, a different result might have been reached, citing\nNLRB v. American Geri-Care, Inc.,697 F.2.d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 906\n(1983)).  Department Counsel has failed to establish that the Judge\u2019s erroneous evidentiary ruling\nconstituted harmful error.  The Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable.\nISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)(non-alleged conduct and circumstances may be considered for\ncertain limited purposes, such as in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation,\nmitigation, or changed circumstances;  determining whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and\nconducting a whole-person assessment). \n3 See ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018)(remand because the Judge failed to identify\nwhether statements in a personal subject interview were admitted or excluded from evidence based on whether applicant\nadopted them).\n4 \u201cIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we review the Judge\u2019s decision to\ndetermine whether:  . . .   it reflects a clear error of judgment . . . .\u201d  ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for 2014 and\n2016 and that he had three delinquent debts that totaled a little over $3,200.  The Judge found in\nApplicant\u2019s favor regarding one of the delinquent debts but entered adverse findings for the\nremaining allegations.  She commented that the debts in and of themselves were of limited security\nsignificance, given their relatively small total amount, and she noted Applicant\u2019s claim that he had\nfiled his returns by the close of the record.  However, she stated that Applicant did not corroborate\nhis claim to have filed his taxes, nor had he presented a sufficient explanation for his tax\ndelinquencies.

The Judge found against Applicant on that allegation.  In his appeal\nbrief, Applicant raises two issues that do not establish the Judge committed any harmful error.  First,\nhe argues that he owed no back taxes.  In the decision, the Judge neither stated nor implied  that\nApplicant owed delinquent taxes.  To the contrary, the Judge noted that Applicant had extra\nwithholdings and itemized deductions so that he was always due a refund but concluded his\nexplanations and rationalizations did not excuse his failure to file his Federal tax returns in a timely\nmanner.  Decision at 1.  Second, Applicant also argues the Judge did not take into consideration his\nremarks that he worked in a classified area but did not work with classified information.  This is not\na relevant consideration in determining security clearance eligibility.  We have no authority to\nconsider the extent to which an applicant may or may not actually have access to classified\ninformation in the course of his or her job.
