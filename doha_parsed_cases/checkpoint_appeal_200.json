Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRyan C. Nerney, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 20, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record.  On March 20, 2019, after considering the\nrecord, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is 60 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since 2017.  He has\nworked for other defense contractors in the past and has previously held a security clearance.  In\nresponding to the SOR, he admitted all of the SOR allegations.\nApplicant was born in Lebanon and attended a military academy there for a period before\nresigning.  In the early 1980s, he came to the United States on a student visa.  After graduating from\na U.S. university, he returned to Lebanon.  He married a U.S. citizen and returned to the United\nStates in the late 1980s.  Following their divorce, he remained in the United States and became a\nU.S. citizen in the early 1990s.  In 2003, he returned to Lebanon and married a Lebanese citizen. \nIn 2009, he returned to the United States.  He later divorced his second wife with whom he has two\nminor children.  The children are U.S. citizens, but they reside in Lebanon with their mother.\nIn 2011, Applicant returned to Lebanon for about five years to care for his ailing mother who\nlater passed away.  His father is also deceased.  He has two sisters who are citizens and residents of\nLebanon.  One sister owns a store, and the other is a housewife.  The occupations of their spouses\nare unknown.  Applicant borrowed money from one sister when he lived in Lebanon.  He talked to\nhis sisters weekly when his mother was alive.  Since her passing, the frequency of his contact with\nhis sisters is unknown.  The U.S. Department of State discourages U.S. citizens from traveling to\nLebanon due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict.  Kidnapping and refugee camps in Lebanon \npose security threats.  Lebanon also has significant human rights issues.  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debts, including a Federal\ntax debt of $39,000.  For three of the delinquent debts totaling over $13,000, he submitted no\ndocumentary evidence showing efforts to resolve them.  In his security clearance application, he\ndisclosed that he failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2012, 2014, and 2015, and\nestimated he owed about $27,000 in past-due Federal taxes for 2012 and 2015.  In his SOR response,\nhe provided documentation of an IRS payment agreement, but he submitted no proof of payments. \nHe also provided notices that he owes past-due taxes for other years, but was entitled to a refund in\n2017. \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nDue to the risks of crime, terrorism, and armed conflict in Lebanon, a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation and a potential conflict of interest arises from Applicant\u2019s children being in the\ncustody of a citizen and resident of that country.  An alleged debt owed to Applicant\u2019s sister is not\ndelinquent because she has not established a repayment date.  Applicant\u2019s other debts are numerous\nand recent.  He has not established that any of the mitigating conditions apply in his case. \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends, \u201cThe nature of [Applicant\u2019s] relationship with his [sisters]\noverseas has greatly diminished since the passing of his mother.  The only reason he communicated\nwith his sisters as frequently as he did in the past was because they were caring for his ailing\nmother.\u201d   Appeal Brief at 10.  As support for that contention, Applicant\u2019s Counsel cites only to Page\n3 of the decision.  On that page, however, the Judge stated, \u201cWhen his mother was alive, he talked\nto his sisters weekly because they cared for his mother.  The record does not reflect the frequency\nof his contact with his sisters now that his mother has passed away.\u201d  The contention of Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel that Applicant\u2019s relationship with his sisters has \u201cgreatly diminished since the passing of\nhis mother\u201d fails for a lack of specificity because he has failed to cite to any record evidence to\nsupport that proposition.  The appealing party has the burden of raising and demonstrating factual\nor legal error by the Judge and must set forth its assignments of error with specificity.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-03372 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018)(discussing the reasons why assignments\nof error must be set forth with specificity).\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also argues that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence\nand did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept.  In his arguments,\nhe cites, for example, to such matters as Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment, divorces, and IRS\npayment agreement, as well as to the nature and extent of his foreign contacts.  His arguments,\nhowever, are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence\nin the record nor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019). \nWe give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that Applicant\u2019s Counsel has cited in support\nof his arguments, but they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to\nundermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id. at 4. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Myers, Esq.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 29, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 14, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her\nfindings of fact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we reverse.\nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged the Applicant was arrested and charged with three\nalcohol-related driving offenses between 2010 and 2017.  Those allegations were cross-alleged in\na single Guideline J allegation.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline G\nallegations and admitted in part and denied in part the Guideline J allegation. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in his mid-40s, has been working for the same employer for about four\nyears.  He is married with children.  He has earned a master\u2019s degree and has held a security\nclearance for about 15 years. \nIn 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and\npossession of an open container.  The police stopped him for an erratic lane change after he left a\nnightclub.  He pled not guilty, and the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.1  He attended alcohol\ncounseling classes and later returned to social drinking.  \nIn 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  He was found guilty of that charge,\nwas ordered to attend alcohol safety classes, had his driver\u2019s license restricted for one year, and paid\na fine.  This incident occurred after he left a bar but did not feel intoxicated.  He acknowledged that\nhe had consumed three or four cocktails.\n1 Government Exhibit 5 indicates this charge was \u201cDismissed for Want of Prosecution\u201d, which is not the same\nas a lack of evidence.    \n2\n\nIn 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) second\noffense in five years.  He pled guilty, was ordered to attend an alcohol safety action program, and\nhad his driver\u2019s license restricted until October 2018.2  An ignition interlock system was placed on\nhis vehicle and he blew positive on one occasion, \u201cbut this was not from drinking but rather from\nmouthwash.\u201d  Decision at 2.  He completed 15 weeks of counseling with a social worker.  His family\nconvinced him that he had to abstain from drinking.  He acknowledged that he had a problem with\nalcohol that was impacting his life and he needed to change.  Since 2017, he has not had a drink. \nHe submitted treatment progress reports that showed he was in full compliance with the plan.  He\nsigned letters of intent in 2018 and 2019.  He still attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings\nand no longer socializes with those with whom he would abuse alcohol.  During his 2018\ninvestigative interview, Applicant discussed his early alcohol use and \u201calso stated that he would not\ndrink and drive again.\u201d  Decision at 2, citing investigative interview.\nApplicant\u2019s witnesses stated he is a man of integrity who is dedicated to his family. \nApplicant\u2019s father has not seen him drink in two years.  His wife testified there is no alcohol in their\nhome and she does not drink.  She is convinced that he has learned his lesson.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nUnder Guideline G, the Judge noted that Applicant completed an alcohol and drug counseling\nprogram, 15 sessions of counseling, and still attends AA.  His last alcohol use was in 2017.  He\nsigned two letters of intent.  \u201cAt least a year free of drinking seems to be a reasonable period or\nbenchmark upon which to best assess that Applicant is fully in control of his use of alcohol and\ncapable of responsible judgment.\u201d  Decision at 5-6.  \nUnder Guideline J, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s drinking and driving convictions in 2013\nand 2017 established disqualifying conditions.  However, he is genuinely contrite, changed his\nlifestyle, and abstains from alcohol.  He completed all court-ordered requirements and is now ready\nto go forward in compliance with laws and regulations.\nIn her whole-person analysis, the Judge noted that she \u201cconsidered Applicant\u2019s highly\ncredible testimony, background, age, behavioral changes, and subsequent maturation.\u201d  Decision at\n7.  She concluded the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns were mitigated. \nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\n2 The Judge did not mention that Applicant was sentenced to180 days imprisonment with 166 of those days\nsuspended.  Government Exhibit (GE) 3 and Tr. at 70. \n3\n\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).   \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered\nfor national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl\n2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred in a finding of fact and in her analysis of\nthe mitigating conditions.  We agree.  Department Counsel notes that, contrary to the Judge\u2019s\nfinding, Applicant\u2019s background interview in which he stated \u201che would not drink and drive ever\nagain\u201d did not occur in 2018.  Decision at 2.  Rather, Applicant made that statement to an\ninvestigator in July 2017, about two weeks before his third arrest for a drinking and driving offense. \nGE 2 at 11.  Department Counsel persuasively argues \u201c[c]orrectly connecting the date of the\ninterview and the subsequent DUI is a significant aspect of the case because avowal not to drink and\ndrive, followed by another DUI weeks later reflects an inordinate level of bad judgment . . . .\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 3.  Moreover, the Judge\u2019s failure to address this significant aspect of the case\nconsiderably weakens her favorable mitigation analysis.  \nAs a related matter, Department Counsel compellingly argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable\ncredibility determination was flawed because she failed to analyze the impact of Applicant\u2019s\nprevious failure to follow through on his declaration to the investigator that he would never again\ndrink and drive.  This was a significant factor that undermines his statement at the hearing regarding\nhis intention to abstain from alcohol use in the future.  Tr. at 56 and 67.  While the Board gives\ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1), that deference is not without\nlimits.  When the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility (such as evidence that\nwould support a contradictory finding) the Judge should address that aspect of the record explicitly,\nexplaining why he or she finds an applicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief.  Failure to do\nso suggests that a Judge has merely substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor\nfor record evidence.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 10-09035 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 10, 2014).\nDepartment Counsel also challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]t least a year free of\ndrinking seems to be a reasonable period or benchmark upon which to best assess that Applicant is \nfully in control of his use of alcohol and capable of responsible judgment.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 17,\nciting Decision at 5-6.  The Directive does not specify how much time must pass to mitigate the\nvarious types of misconduct identified in the adjudicative guidelines.  The Board has repeatedly\ndeclined to establish a \"bright-line\" rule for evaluating the recency of misconduct.  The extent to\nwhich security concerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question that must\nbe resolved based on the evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04070 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 18, 2019).  In this case, Department Counsel notes that \u201cApplicant [previously] abstained from\nalcohol for a period of one to two years, and he also managed to avoid a DUI for more than two years\n4\n\n(from December 2010 to February 2013) and for more than four years (from February 2013 to\nAugust 2017) before reverting back to prior behavior.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 18.  Given Applicant\u2019s\ndrinking and driving history, the Judge failed to explain convincingly why Applicant\u2019s latest period\nof abstinence of was a sufficient gauge for concluding his alcohol-related misconduct was behind\nhim.   \nDepartment Counsel further notes that Applicant had a positive alcohol reading on his\nignition interlock system during the 12-month period his driver\u2019s privileges were restricted.   The\npositive reading precluded Applicant from using his vehicle on that occasion.  In this proceeding,\nthe Judge accepted Applicant\u2019s explanation that the positive reading was due to his use of\nmouthwash without addressing that Applicant was required to appear before a state court judge to\nevaluate Applicant\u2019s ignition interlock compliance, that Applicant gave the same explanation to the\nstate court judge for the positive reading, and that he was ordered to maintain the ignition interlock\nsystem for an additional \u201cthree or six months\u201d as a result of that positive reading.  Tr. at 72-73. \nAgain, the Judge\u2019s failure to address the full extent of such negative evidence tends to suggest she\nwas substituting a favorable impression of Applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  The ignition\ninterlock system was removed from Applicant\u2019s vehicle less than eight months before his security\nclearance hearing.   AE J. \nIn short, Applicant was arrested three times for DUI/DWI between 2010 and 2017.  He\ncompleted alcohol safety classes after his first two arrests but continued to drink and drive\nirresponsibly.  He declared to an investigator in 2017 that he would never again drink and drive and\nless than a month afterwards was arrested for DWI.  While his driving privileges were restricted\nfollowing his latest conviction, he had a positive alcohol reading on his ignition interlock system that\nresulted in an extension of the period he was required to use that system.  Based on our review of\nthe record, we conclude the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to\nconsider important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. \nFurthermore, we conclude that the record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate\nthe Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard.  The decision is not sustainable.\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 1, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\ncontained errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.

He had previous\nperiods of employment by this same firm, beginning in 2008, and he seeks to retain a clearance he\nhas held since that time.  A college graduate, Applicant is married with two children.\nApplicant regularly used marijuana from about 2010 until the end of 2013, while holding a\nsecurity clearance.  He stated that his father, who suffered from several emotional problems,\ndementia, and possibly post-traumatic stress disorder, was living with him at the time.  Applicant\naverred that caring for his father was a great source of stress.  Applicant provided inconsistent\nstatements about his marijuana use.  In response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he had used\nmarijuana weekly from 2010 to 2013.  However, in a period of hospitalization that occurred in 2013,\nto be discussed below, he stated that he had used marijuana daily in 2013.  Applicant attributed these\ninconsistencies to memory problems that possibly had resulted from head trauma he suffered during\nhigh school athletics.  There is no evidence of marijuana use after his hospitalization.  Applicant\nsigned a statement of intent to refrain from illegal drug use.\nIn late 2013, Applicant was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility.  His family advised\nthat Applicant had \u201cexpressed suicidal ideation.\u201d  Decision at 3.  The intake interview described\nApplicant as follows: \u201cvery grossly psychotic and delusional, disorganized, loose, incoherent, [and \nhe made] bizarre statements.\u201d  Id.  Applicant had been running about the streets and entering the\nhomes of strangers without permission.  The admission diagnosis was bipolar affective disorder, not\notherwise specified, \u201ccurrently depressed with psychosis and in acute exacerbation,\u201d and intermittent\nmarijuana abuse.  Id.  Applicant was prescribed medication, which stabilized his mood.  His\ndischarge diagnosis was bipolar affective disorder, not otherwise specified, \u201ccurrently manic with\npsychosis,\u201d and severe marijuana abuse.  Id.  Applicant continued psychiatric treatment for a while\nafter discharge.  He did not believe that his medication was necessary, and he stopped both taking\nhis medication and seeing the psychiatrist in 2014.  He noted that the psychiatrist wanted him to\ncontinue his medication, but he felt that she did not really care about him as a patient.\n2\n\nIn early 2017, at the request of the DoD, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical\npsychologist.  This person diagnosed him with bipolar I disorder, hypomanic, and cannabis use\ndisorder, in prolonged remission.  She concluded that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was poor without\ncomplying with treatment and that he is at risk of another manic episode, during which his judgment\nwill be severely impaired.\nApplicant does not agree with this diagnosis.  He has been seeing a licensed clinical social\nworker since mid-2018, who diagnosed him with adjustment disorder unspecified.  Her report stated\nthat Applicant showed no evidence of bipolar disorder and that he is emotionally stable.  Applicant\nalso sought his own evaluation from a psychologist and a licensed clinical psychologist, who\ndiagnosed him with adjustment disorder unspecified.  They concluded that Applicant does not\nexhibit a level of anxiety that rises to a clinical level.\nThere is no evidence of recurrence of psychotic or delusional behavior.  Applicant is an\nactive member of his church, from which he has received counseling and guidance.  His wife does\nnot believe that he is bipolar and has seen no evidence of erratic behavior.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge entered favorable findings on an allegation that, in early 2014, Applicant had\ndiscontinued medical treatment for bipolar disorder against his doctor\u2019s advice.  He stated that,\nwithout direct evidence from the doctor, he could not find that the doctor had not, albeit reluctantly,\ngone along with Applicant\u2019s decision to forgo treatment.  However, the Judge entered adverse\nfindings regarding Applicant\u2019s psychiatric diagnosis of bipolar disorder and his marijuana use.  He\ncited to evidence of the behavior that Applicant exhibited prior to his 2013 hospitalization, the\ndiagnosis of bipolar disorder given upon discharge, and the 2017 similar diagnosis by the clinical\npsychologist appointed by DoD.  Though noting the diagnoses of adjustment disorder by Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent counselor and by the two psychologists, the Judge stated that he gave greater weight to the\nconclusions of those who treated Applicant during his hospitalization.  He stated that he was unable\nto reconcile the diagnoses of adjustment disorder with the description of Applicant\u2019s behavior in the\nhospital admission documents.  \nRegarding the allegation of marijuana misuse (alleged under Guideline E), the Judge\nacknowledged that there is no evidence of such misconduct since 2013.  However, he stated that he\nhad lingering concerns due to Applicant having chosen to violate the law, sometimes on a daily\nbasis, while holding a security clearance.  He also noted Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements and\naverred that he is not convinced of the true extent of Applicant\u2019s drug misuse.  The Judge cited to\nthe requirement of the Directive that any doubts about an applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility must be\nresolved in favor of national security.\nDiscussion\n3\n\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding (contained in the Analysis portion of the Decision) \nthat he suffered from bipolar disorder.1  He cites to the opinions of his own therapists as well as to\ndocumentary evidence that he submitted into evidence.  We examine a Judge\u2019s findings to see if they\nare supported by substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might\naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2019).  \nIt is true that there is a conflict in the evidence regarding this matter.  The evidence submitted\nby the Government includes diagnoses, both in 2013, one of which is a hospital discharge record\nafter a week as an in-patient, and again in 2017, of bipolar disorder, while Applicant\u2019s evidence\ncontains diagnoses of adjustment disorder.  It is a Judge\u2019s job to resolve conflicts in the evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03024 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019).  After examining the record as a\nwhole, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s finding on this matter.  Among other things, he cited\nto descriptions of Applicant\u2019s conduct contained in the hospital admission documents\u2014making\nbizarre statements, entering the homes of strangers without permission, etc.  During the hearing,\nApplicant stated that there was no reason for hospital personnel to have made up these factual\nassertions and did not challenge their accuracy.  Tr. at 67.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that this conduct\nwas consistent with the hospitalization diagnosis as well as with the later one by the DoD\npsychologist is supportable.  We conclude that the challenged finding is based upon substantial\nevidence.  To the extent that this argument constitutes a challenge to the relative weight that the\nJudge assigned to the evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s psychiatric diagnosis, we find no reason to\nconclude that the Judge weighed this evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02250 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2019).\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis is contradictory, citing to the Judge\u2019s favorable\nfinding on the allegation that he had stopped treatment in 2014 against his doctor\u2019s advice.  He\nargues that the implication of this favorable finding means that he had, in fact, continued with his\ntreatment, and that this apparent meaning is in conflict with other statements by the Judge to the\neffect that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is poor without treatment.  This argument is without merit.  The\nJudge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding this allegation only because he was not satisfied that his\nmedical provider did not, possibly reluctantly, concur with his decision to withdraw from treatment. \nNowhere in the Decision does the Judge appear to assert that Applicant had, in fact, continued the\ntreatment in 2014.  Aside from this, Applicant\u2019s challenge to the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis under\nboth Guidelines amounts to a disagreement with the manner in which the Judge weighed the\nevidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id.  \nApplicant believes that the Judge should have considered Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\nmitigating conditions.   Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was alleged under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nand not under Guideline H.  However, even if the Judge had amended the SOR to include Guideline\n1Applicant relies, in part, on the distinction between Bipolar I Disorder and Bipolar Affective Disorder, Not\nOtherwise Specified.  The Judge gave the most weight to Bipolar Affective Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified.\n4\n\nH concerns and entered favorable findings for them, his adverse decision under Guideline E would\nstill be supportable.  His ultimate conclusion under that Guideline was that Applicant\u2019s marijuana\nuse while holding a clearance and his inconsistent statements left him with doubt.  Applicant has not\ncited to a harmful error in the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis. \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant has a complicated marital history. Applicant\u2019s first wife was a U.S. citizen. They married in 1986, divorced in 1995, remarried in 1999, separated in 2000, and later divorced. They had three children. In 2007 while working in China, Applicant began dating a woman who was a citizen and resident of China. His security officer issued him a cease and desist order that required him to terminate contact with the Chinese woman or risk losing his security clearance and job. He stopped seeing her until his contract ended. In 2008, they married. She entered the United State in 2009 and became a U.S. citizen in 2014. In 2010, they had a child who was born in the United States. In about 2012, Applicant\u2019s second wife had a child with another man, but Applicant refers to this child as his own.1 Applicant and his second wife divorced in August 2017. 1 Applicant\u2019s appeal brief reflects that he was ordered to pay support for this child because paternity was not contested within an allotted period. 2 Applicant\u2019s second wife\u2019s parents were citizens and residents of China.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nSeptember 7, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.  On July 31, 2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Bayard Glendon denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe SOR alleged the following:\na.  Your wife is a citizen of China; and her sister, also a citizen of China, is married to your\noldest son.\nb.  Your mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of China; you provide\nfinancial support to your mother-in-law.\nc.  You regularly use a Chinese online chat program to meet and communicate with citizens\nof China.\nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant denied the first two allegations and admitted the third. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has a complicated marital history.  Applicant\u2019s first wife was a U.S. citizen.  They\nmarried in 1986, divorced in 1995, remarried in 1999, separated in 2000, and later divorced.  They\nhad three children.\nIn 2007 while working in China, Applicant began dating a woman who was a citizen and\nresident of China.  His security officer issued him a cease and desist order that required him to\nterminate contact with the Chinese woman or risk losing his security clearance and job.  He stopped\nseeing her until his contract ended.  In 2008, they married.  She entered the United State in 2009 and\nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2014.  In 2010, they had a child who was born in the United States.  In\nabout 2012, Applicant\u2019s second wife had a child with another man, but Applicant refers to this  child\nas his own.1  Applicant and his second wife divorced in August 2017.  \n1 Applicant\u2019s appeal brief reflects that he was ordered to pay support for this child because paternity was not\ncontested within an allotted period.    \n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s second wife\u2019s parents were citizens and residents of China.  Starting in about\n2008, he provided his then mother-in-law with monthly financial support, and she later spent part\nof each year living in his home in the United States.  He stopped supporting her \u201cyears ago.\u201d \nDecision at 3.  His former mother-in-law has become a U.S. permanent resident and is apparently\nno longer married.  Applicant\u2019s son from his first marriage married his second wife\u2019s sister in 2016. \nEven after his divorce in 2017, Applicant\u2019s former sister-in-law is his daughter-in-law and his former\nmother-in-law is his son\u2019s mother-in-law.  He claims he only talks to his second wife and her mother\nwhen contacting his children from that marriage.   \nIn a background interview in 2017, Applicant disclosed that he met a Chinese woman over\na Chinese-based online chat program and indicated that he was interested in having a relationship\nwith the woman.  At that time, he did not know anything about her employment status or her\nrelationship with the Chinese government.  After submitting his security clearance application and\nundergoing his background interviews, Applicant married the Chinese woman who had worked as\na general manager of a Chinese company.  She has an adult child who is a student in China.  The date\nof Applicant\u2019s latest marriage does not appear in the record.  Applicant and his wife reside together\nat a location in Africa.  He is sponsoring her for U.S. resident status.  Limited details are known\nabout her.  Applicant\u2019s latest marriage is not alleged in the SOR.  Department Counsel did not amend\nthe SOR to address this new marriage, although she noted this marriage is relevant to the third SOR\nallegation listed above and to the issue of mitigation.  (We not that the Judge also could have\namended the SOR on his own motion to \u201crender it in conformity with the evidence\u201d and given the\nparties appropriate opportunity to respond.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.)\nApplicant submitted a number of reference letters that reflect he is trustworthy.  His response\nto Department Counsel\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) asserts that neither is current wife nor\nsecond wife are affiliated with the Chinese Government, that neither of them could be exploited, and\nthat he would report any \u201chypothetical scenario\u201d to security officials.  Decision at 4, citing FORM\nresponse at 22-26. \n \nChina is an authoritarian state that actively engages in intelligence gathering.  It targets U.S.\ninformation and technology.  Its intelligence services and private companies seek to exploit Chinese\ncitizens or persons with ties to China who can steal protected information.  Its intelligence services\nalso routinely monitor communications, including those transmitted over the Internet.  It has a poor\nhuman rights record.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nAlthough Applicant was put on notice in 2007 that his relationship with a Chinese national\npresented an unacceptable security risk, he later married her and, following their divorce, married\nanother Chinese national.  His relationships with his second wife, her mother, and her sister are\nongoing because of his children from that marriage.  He also maintains a relationship with his second\nwife\u2019s sister through her marriage to his son.  Additionally, he married a woman he met through a\nChinese website.  Given China\u2019s intelligence operations and human rights record, Applicant has not\n3\n\nestablished that it is unlikely he would be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of his foreign contacts and those of the United States.  \nThe evidence does not demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s sense of obligation to his second wife,\nher mother, and her sister are minimal.  Applicant\u2019s use of a Chinese online chat program to search\nfor a new wife also undercuts his mitigation evidence.  Applicant worked overseas for the last 15\nyears.  Based on the evidence presented, it cannot be concluded that there is no conflict of interest\nbecause of the Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his second wife\u2019s father does not create a risk of foreign influence\nbecause it is casual and infrequent.  The same cannot be said regarding his relationship with his\nsecond wife, her mother, and her sister.  He has not shown that his relationship with his current wife\nand her family creates little likelihood of risk for foreign influence.  He also maintains a close\nrelationship with his third wife\u2019s child in China.  The Judge found against Applicant on the three\nSOR allegations.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains information that is not in the record.  Such information\nincludes his accounts of discussions with security officers.  We cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant also contends that he possesses skills needed to support U.S. \nnational interests.  The Appeal Board, however, has previously noted an applicant\u2019s contributions\nto national security are not relevant or material in assessing his or her security eligibility.  See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-05820 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2019).\nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments are in essence a challenge to the manner in which the\nJudge weighed the evidence.   For example, he argues that he has very little or no contact with his\nsecond wife or her family beyond logistical or trivial family matters, that he has strong ties to family\nmember in the United States, and that he works outside the United States only for the purpose of\nsupporting his family back home.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\n \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

In her second appeal brief, Applicant indicated that she submitted matters in response to Department\nCounsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material that did not make it into the record.  Her second brief also reflects that she mailed\nthose matters to her company, instead of to Department Counsel or DOHA.

Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive && E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge=s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge=s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He served in the military on\nactive duty for about three years and in the National Guard for about nine years.  He received\nhonorable discharges for his military service.  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has seven delinquent debts totaling about $34,800.  He\nadmitted each of the debts in his SOR response.  These were incurred as a result of a failed business\nventure.  He satisfied three of those debts through settlements.  He stated that he is slowly working\nto resolve the others.  He owes about $29,900 on the remaining three debts.  He also indicated that\nhe recently hired a credit repair company to assist him in resolving them.  At this point, insufficient\nevidence has been presented to show his debts are being resolved or are under control.   \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence of\nAlcohol and Driving While Having Measurable Blood Alcohol in early 2017.  Later that year, he\npled guilty to at least one of those offenses.  He was placed on probation for three years, which will\nend in 2020.  He has satisfied all other court requirements.   Given his recent conviction and ongoing\nprobation, he has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns.\nDiscussion\nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  He contends that the Judge\ndid not consider all of the record evidence and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person concept.  For example, he argues that he presented proof of his good character,\njudgment, and trustworthiness and has shown his unwavering loyalty to the United States through\nhis years of Government service while holding a security clearance without any incident.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nC. Russell Georgeson, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On   \nSeptember 12, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On May 22, 2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with\nthe following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists five delinquent debts, which he attributes to a divorce and resulting\nloss of his former spouse\u2019s income.  These debts include the mortgage on a home, valued at about\n$850,000 and which Applicant short sold for about $795,000.  There is no evidence regarding the\napparent $55,000 deficiency.  Applicant\u2019s SOR also lists a debt of about $97,000, a charged-off\nhome equity line of credit.  Applicant presented nothing about the status of this debt.  The remaining\nthree debts total a little over $700.  Again, Applicant submitted no evidence regarding the status of\nthese obligations.\nThough noting that Applicant\u2019s divorce and diminution of income were circumstances\nbeyond his control, the Judge concluded that he had presented little evidence of responsible action\nin regard to his debts.  He stated that Applicant did not demonstrate efforts to resolve his debts and\nthat the record is silent regarding his ability to address them.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\nhad failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant raises an issue of due process.  He states that his request for a decision on the\nwritten record was done \u201cthrough naivety and ignorance of the process.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 5.  He also\nasserts that a page is missing from Item 3, Clearance Interview Summary, and that this missing page\nshould not be considered in evidence.  Item 3 as contained in the record includes the page asserted\nto be missing.  However, the Judge did not cite to that page.  \nThe DoD CAF sent Applicant his SOR accompanied by a copy of the Directive, which\ncontains guidance about procedures to be followed regarding decisions on the record as well as\nhearings.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7 et seq.  The SOR was also accompanied by a document whereby\nApplicant could make his forum selection.  The option that Applicant chose, a decision on the\nadministrative record, included the following information:  \n2\n\nA decision based on the administrative (written) record, without a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  This will include a memo prepared by a DoD Department\nCounsel.  You will have an opportunity to respond to the memo and to provide\ndocuments or other evidence before the record is submitted to the Administrative\nJudge for decision. [Attachment to Answer to SOR.]  \nThe record shows that Applicant signed his forum election on September 25, 2018.  In his Answer,\nApplicant stated explicitly that he chose \u201ca decision to be made by the Administrative Judge based\nupon the administrative record.  I understand the Government may still elect a hearing.\u201d  There is\nnothing in Applicant\u2019s answer to suggest confusion or misunderstanding.     \nThe File of Relevant Material (FORM) prepared by Department Counsel and presented to\nApplicant advised Applicant that he had thirty days from its receipt to submit a documentary\nresponse \u201csetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel accompanied the FORM with a cover letter, dated October 19, 2018, which\nprovided similar information.  In addition, in the FORM, Department Counsel drew Applicant\u2019s\nattention to Item 3 and advised that Applicant could object to admission of the exhibit.  In the\nalternative, Department Counsel stated that Applicant could comment on the accuracy of Item 3 and\nmake any corrections, additions, and updates as necessary.  Applicant responded to the FORM,\naddressing the circumstances underlying his financial problems.  He submitted documentary\nevidence regarding the short sale of his home as well as a court order pertaining to his divorce. \nApplicant did not object to Item 3, nor did he bring to the Judge\u2019s attention a missing page or make\nany other comment or complaint.  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to object forfeits any issue he may otherwise have had about the\ncompleteness of Item 3.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01962 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2018).  Although\npro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable\nsteps to protect their rights.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 17-02196 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2018). \nMoreover, we conclude that both the DoD CAF and DOHA provided Applicant with information\nsufficient to have enabled him to make a knowing and intelligent choice of forum.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 15-04472 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2017).  Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and his Response\nto the FORM demonstrate that he has the requisite education and ability to understand the guidance\nthat he received.  Applicant was not denied the due process afforded by the Directive.    \nApplicant\u2019s brief contains a substantial amount of information from outside the record.  We\ncannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant cites to various aspects of\nthe record, including his having informed appropriate officials at his place of employment of his\nsecurity concerns, the contents of his credit reports, his work for a Defense contractor, the\ninformation contained in his security clearance application, and evidence that his problems were\ncaused by his divorce.  He also notes a sentence in the interview summary to the effect that there is\nnothing in Applicant\u2019s background that could be used against him.  This last point represents\nApplicant\u2019s statement to the interviewer, not the interviewer\u2019s judgment as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a clearance.  In any event, even if an investigator offered such an opinion it would not bind the\nDoD in its evaluation of an applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03548 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\n3\n\nMay 23, 2019).  Applicant\u2019s arguments are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 2 (App. Bd. May\n28, 2019).  In essence, Applicant argues for a different interpretation of the record, which is not\nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02250 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2019).  \nApplicant requests that he receive a clearance with a warning.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App.\nA \u00b6 2(h).  This is appropriate only when an applicant\u2019s circumstances are not serious enough to\nwarrant an adverse decision.  Given the extent of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and the paucity of\nmitigating evidence, neither the Judge nor other officials erred by failing to apply this procedure. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01661 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2019).    \nApplicant contends that the Decision is lacking in facts and analysis.  However, though it is\nadmittedly brief, we conclude that the Decision captures the essential facts of Applicant\u2019s case and\narrives at conclusions consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the record.  Despite Applicant\u2019s\nargument to the contrary, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the\nrequirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3 and Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(a) et seq., in that the Judge considered the\ntotality of the evidence in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03592 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJun. 14, 2017).  Applicant has not cited to any error that likely affected the outcome of the case.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No.17-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2018) for the definition of harmful error.     \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal. Consistent with the following, we affirm. The Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact The Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: Applicant was born in Iraq. He came to the U.S. in the late 2000s, along with his parents and siblings. He and his family became U.S. citizens about five years later. Applicant is unmarried and has no children. He is seeking a security clearance in connection with an offer of employment. Applicant maintains regular contact with numerous relatives\u2013aunts, uncles, and cousins\u2013who are citizens and residents of Iraq. He made conflicting statements concerning his security-significant circumstances. For example, he advised his clearance interviewer and he had no plans to renounce his Iraqi citizenship, though at about the same time he presented a signed statement announcing his willingness to do so.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nDecember 7, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On September 5, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\ncontained errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent\nwith the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal:  Applicant\nwas born in Iraq.  He came to the U.S. in the late 2000s, along with his parents and siblings.  He and\nhis family became U.S. citizens about five years later.  Applicant is unmarried and has no children. \nHe is seeking a security clearance in connection with an offer of employment.  Applicant maintains\nregular contact with numerous relatives\u2013aunts, uncles, and cousins\u2013who are citizens and residents\nof Iraq.  He made conflicting statements concerning his security-significant circumstances.  For\nexample, he advised his clearance interviewer and he had no plans to renounce his Iraqi citizenship,\nthough at about the same time he presented a signed statement announcing his willingness to do so. \nIn a security-screening interview conducted about two months later, he stated that he would not\nrenounce his Iraqi citizenship.  \nApplicant made other inconsistent statements.  In his security-screening interview, for\nexample, he advised that he was uncertain if he would remain in the U.S. because Iraq is his home. \nHe also stated that he is more loyal to Iraq, though he changed that response to the effect that he is\nloyal to the U.S. first but considers himself loyal to the country of his birth as well.  At the hearing,\nhe denied having stated that he was more loyal to Iraq, surmising that the interviewer misunderstood\nhis answer.\nIraq is a key partner with the U.S. in the Middle East and plays an increasingly constructive\nrole in the region.  However, U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk of violence or kidnaping, and the\nState Department warns them not to travel there.  The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a terrorist\norganization, operates within Iraq, although its territorial control has drastically diminished over the\npast two years.  Human rights violations continue to be a problem in Iraq.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n2\n\nThe Judge noted evidence that \u201cApplicant maintains regular and continuing contact with his\nuncles, aunts, and cousins in Iraq.\u201d  Decision at 9.  She cited to Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements\nabout his devotion to Iraq and his intent to return there in the future.  She concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nconnections in Iraq are \u201ctoo significant to mitigate in the circumstances\u201d arising from his connections\nin Iraq.  Id.  The Judge cited to official notice documents that described the ongoing danger of\nterrorist violence in Iraq, concluding that Applicant\u2019s connections in Iraq, viewed in the context of\nthat country\u2019s geopolitical situation, are not consistent with a favorable Guideline B decision.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  He challenges the Judge\u2019s findings concerning his intent to return to Iraq as\nwell as those concerning the frequency of his contact with his Iraqi relatives.  We have examined\nthese findings and conclude that they are based upon \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind\nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same\nrecord.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.

Applicant\u2019s argument is not sufficient to\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02250 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2019).   \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDanel A. Dufresne, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 9, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 7, 2019, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel raised the following issues on appeal:  whether Applicant was denied\ndue process because of the Judge\u2019s factual and legal errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline\nH allegations and on three Guideline E allegations.  Those favorable findings have not been raised\nas issues on appeal and are not discussed directly below.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is 47 years old, has been working for his current employer since 2014.  He\nretired from the U.S. Navy in 2009 and held a security clearance in the Navy.  Since his retirement,\nhe has periodically worked in Afghanistan supporting U.S. military forces.  \nApplicant admitted with explanations each of the falsification allegations that the Judge\nfound against him.  After retiring from the military, Applicant used marijuana with friends on about\nseven occasions between 2009 and 2014.  He purchased marijuana once in mid-2014.  In submitting\na security clearance application (SCA) in August 2014, he did not disclose his use or purchase of\nmarijuana as required by questions.  At that time, he also signed an acknowledgment that he\nunderstood a Federal agency\u2019s policy that illegal drug use was prohibited.  In October 2014,\nApplicant submitted another SCA in which he again failed to disclose his use and purchase of\nmarijuana.  In  November 2014, he again used marijuana.    \nIn a background interview in December 2014, Applicant initially denied any involvement\nwith illegal drugs.  Upon further questioning, he admitted using marijuana six or seven times\nbetween 2009 and 2014 and purchasing it once.  Four days later, he underwent another interview in\nwhich he disclosed only two uses of marijuana and denied further drug involvement.  Due to his drug\ninvolvement and false statements, a Federal agency denied him clearance eligibility in 2015. \nFollowing a hearing, the denial was upheld on appeal.  \nIn 2016, Applicant submitted another SCA in which he disclosed his drug involvement.  In\na follow-on background interview, he stated that he did not disclose his marijuana use in the prior\napplications out of fear that it would impact his clearance eligibility.  In addition to the above, the\nJudge made the following findings:\n2\n\nIn 2007, Applicant was a petty officer first class (E-6) and a leading petty\nofficer (LPO) in charge of about 17 other sailors on his ship.  In applying for chief\npetty officer (E-7), Applicant submitted documentation falsely representing that he\nhad obtained certain qualifications necessary for promotion.  On the documentation,\nhe forged or falsified his senior chief petty officer\u2019s signature.  He submitted the\ndocumentation to the very [same] senior chief whose signature he had forged, and she\nnoticed the discrepancy right away.  Applicant was charged under the Uniform Code\nof Military Justice (UCMJ) with making a false statement.  He received non-judicial\npunishment (NJP) and was reduced in rank to E-5.  He was allowed to remain in the\nNavy so he could retire after 20 years.  . . .  This incident is not alleged in the SOR.\n[Decision at 4-5.]\nA former coworker attested to Applicant\u2019s honesty and integrity.  Company executives\npraised Applicant\u2019s performance, noted he is remorseful for his misconduct, and recommended him\nfor a security clearance.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his use and purchase of marijuana in two SCAs in\n2014.  He deliberately under-reported his drug use in a background interview in 2014.  At that time, \nhe knew his recent marijuana involvement might affect his clearance eligibility.  Applicant\u2019s\nsubsequent disclosure of his drug involvement in his 2016 SCA was not a prompt, good-faith effort\nto correct the falsifications before being confronted with the facts.  His falsifications are not isolated\nor minor.  Although they are several years old, they represent a pattern of poor judgment and lack\nof candor.\n    \nWhile Applicant\u2019s prior incident of falsification in the Navy cannot be considered as\ndisqualifying conduct, it could be considered in assessing such matters as mitigation, changed\ncircumstances, or rehabilitation.  \u201cApplicant\u2019s falsification in the Navy is now many years old, but,\ncoupled with his falsifications on his 2014 SCAs and during his 2014 interview, it weighs heavily\nagainst mitigation.\u201d  Decision at 11.  None of the Guideline E mitigating conditions fully apply to\nthe allegations for which the Judge found against Applicant.  \nDiscussion\n1.  Department Counsel misled Applicant before the hearing  \nApplicant represented himself at the hearing below.  On appeal, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\ncontends that Applicant was denied due process because Department Counsel misled him prior to\nthe hearing.  His attorney argues that Department Counsel confronted Applicant shortly before the\n3\n\nhearing and asked him questions about his military service and an alleged employment incident.1 \nHis attorney asserts Department Counsel \u201cengaged in forbidden ambush tactics by badgering\nApplicant minutes before the hearing\u201d and \u201cweaponized the pre-[h]earing information she gathered.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 6.  His attorney quotes from portions of the transcript in support of his argument (Tr.\nat 77-78 and 81) and claims Department Counsel obtained \u201cill-gotten information [that] wasn\u2019t in\nthe record or alleged in the SOR.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 6-8.  This \u201cill-gotten information\u201d apparently\npertains to a NJP awarded to Applicant in 2007 and his retirement from the Navy in pay grade E-5\nin 2009.  We do not find this assignment of error persuasive.  \nIn his 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he went to NJP, also called \u201cCaptain\u2019s Mast,\u201d\ntwice in 2007.  In early 2007, he went to Captain\u2019s Mast for a Communications Security Material\nSystem (CMS) violation.  Later in 2007, he went to Captains Mast for \u201cgun decking\u201d a Chemical,\nBiological, and Radiation Personal Qualification Standards (PQS) document.2  Government Exhibit\n(GE) 1 at 21.  He provided additional information about both incidents in background interviews. \nHe noted that he was first awarded NJP in 2007 for falsely signing a document that reported he\ndestroyed communications security (COMSEC) material.  For this offense, he received restriction\nand extra duty as punishment.  Later that year, he was awarded NJP for \u201cplagiarism.\u201d  \u201c[H]e used\nanother person\u2019s qualification [PQS] to take the board to get qualified.  When [he] turned in the\npapers, [a senior chief] recognized  the papers to be hers.\u201d  For this second offense, he received a\nreduction in pay grade to E-5, restriction, and extra duty.  GE 3 at 12-13 and GE 6.  Furthermore,\nApplicant\u2019s certificate of discharge from active duty (DD 214) is in the record and reflects he retired\nin pay grade E-5 in 2009.  GE 9.  \nContrary to the contentions of Applicant\u2019s Counsel, the record contains information regarding\nApplicant\u2019s NJPs in 2007 and his retirement in pay grade E-5 in 2009.  The record evidence,\nincluding the quoted portions of the transcript in the appeal brief, does not support his argument that\nDepartment Counsel misled Applicant prior to the hearing or that she obtained \u201cill-gotten\ninformation.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Counsel has failed to establish that Department Counsel engaged in any\nconduct that denied Applicant the due process afforded him under the Directive.\n \n2.  The Judge erred in a finding of fact \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel challenges the following finding of fact:  \u201cIn applying for chief petty\nofficer (E-7), Applicant submitted documentation falsely representing that he had obtained certain\nqualifications necessary for promotion.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 4, quoting from Decision at 4.  He notes\n1 The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the alleged employment incident.  Applicant\u2019s arguments concerning\nthis assignment of error refer to matters that are not in the record.  Normally, we are prohibited from considering new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However, we will consider new evidence when threshold issues such as\njurisdiction or due process are raised.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).  Regarding this\nassignment of error, we are cognizant that Directive \u00b6 E3.1.10 provides that hearings shall be conducted in a fair manner. \n  \n2 \u201cGun decking\u201d is Navy slang for falsifying information, especially in official reports.  \n4\n\nthat Applicant admits to falsifying the document, but disputes he falsified any documents while\napplying for promotion to chief petty officer.  He also argues the Judge characterized this single\ndocument falsification as the equivalent of numerous documents and heavily relied on this error in\nassessing Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation.  We resolve this issue adversely to Applicant.\nApplicant testified that he was up for promotion to chief petty officer just before one of his\nNJP proceedings.  Tr. at 80.  It was not unreasonable for the Judge to have inferred that Applicant\nsubmitted the falsified Chemical, Biological, and Radiation PQS document for  promotion purposes.\nWhile the Judge may have erred regarding the reason why the falsified document was submitted, it\nwas a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 12-00678 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2014).  The key point is not the specific reason why the\ndocument was submitted, but rather that Applicant knowingly submitted a false document for an\nofficial purpose that resulted in him receiving NJP.  \nAdditionally, the Judge\u2019s use of the term \u201cdocumentation\u201d was also harmless error.  When\nreviewing a Judge\u2019s decision, we do not consider individual words or sentences in isolation.  Rather,\nwe consider them in light of the decision in its entirety.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-13664 at 5\n(App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2013).  When viewed in its proper context, the Judge\u2019s use of the term\n\u201cdocumentation\u201d was referring to Applicant\u2019s submission of a false PQS document as opposed to\nhim falsifying \u201cnumerous documents\u201d as Applicant\u2019s Counsel contends.  Furthermore, we find no\nerror in the Judge considering this unalleged misconduct to evaluate Applicant\u2019s case in extenuation\nor mitigation; to determine the extent to which Applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation; or to\nconduct a whole-person analysis.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).\n3.  The Judge incorrectly instructed Applicant to refrain from making objections\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends the Judge denied Applicant due process by instructing him to\nrefrain from making objections.  In support of his argument, he points to the following exchange:\n[Department Counsel]:   . . .   Let\u2019s talk about your service to [an employer], from --\n[Applicant]:   Can I -- can I object to, or can I say something to your last\nstatements?  That was over 11 years ago, and I \u2013 \n[Department Counsel]:  You will have a chance to  -- right now -- right now this is\nmy  \u2013 \n[Applicant]:  I got you.\n[Department Counsel]:  -- question.\n[Judge]: [Department Counsel] is right.\n[Applicant]:  I\u2019m sorry.\n5\n\n[Judge]:  [Applicant], you are on cross, you are being cross-examined right now.\n[Applicant]:  Yes.\n[Judge]:  You will have plenty of opportunity to go back and address something.\n[Applicant]: Yes, sir.  My apologies. [Appeal Brief at 9, quoting from Tr. at 88-89.\nEmphasis in the Appeal Brief quotation.]  \nThis assignment of error lacks merit.  First, Applicant\u2019s request was unclear.  He first asked if he\ncould object without stating a basis for any objection and then asked if he could say something\nduring Department Counsel\u2019s cross examination.  As he started to make a statement, he was\ninformed that he would have an opportunity to address matters later.  The main thrust of Applicant\u2019s\nrequest appears to have been a plea for him to be able to say something at that stage of the\nproceeding, instead of an objection.  Second, it is not uncommon for participants to talk over each\nother at a hearing resulting in some confusion.  Third, and most importantly, the Judge never\nprevented Applicant from making any objections.  Nor did he say anything that could be interpreted\nin that manner.  The above exchange does not reflect the Judge committed any harmful error.    \n4.  The Judge denied Applicant due process by failing to follow provisions of the Directive\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends that Judge failed to follow the procedures in Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.18 by having the Applicant testify without first warning him of the applicability of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1001.3  In support of this argument, he refers to questions the Judge asked Applicant on pages 55-\n56 of the transcript.  However, the Judge warned Applicant of the applicability of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\nat the beginning of the hearing, and Applicant acknowledged that warning.  Tr. at 14.  This\nassignment of error is frivolous.  \n5.  The Judge\u2019s conclusions are so implausible that they cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion   \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s findings reflect an unreasonable interpretation\nof the evidence as a whole and the Judge misapplied the mitigating conditions and whole-person\nconcept.  Applicant\u2019s Counsel, for example, points out that Applicant was allowed to retain his\nsecurity clearance following his 2007 NJPs; that he received several military awards, including four\ngood conduct medals; that he freely admitted being dishonest and has been in counseling for years;\nand that he received several recommendations from peers and supervisors.  He argues that Applicant\nhas eliminated all negative aspects in his life and his misconduct amounted to isolated incidents that\nare unlikely to recur.  His arguments are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\n3 The purpose of \u00b6 E3.1.18 is to advise Applicant and witnesses of potential criminal penalties for knowingly\nand willfully providing false information at the hearing and not to provide Applicant a procedural due process right.  \n6\n\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n02488 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug.  30, 2018).  The evidence shows that Applicant deliberately submitted\nfalse information in documents in 2007 and 2014 and during a security interview in 2014. \nFalsification raises serious questions about an applicant's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness,\nand provides a rational basis for an unfavorable security clearance decision.  Under the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, the failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes is a matter of special interest.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\n15.   Once the Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified security clearance applications and\ndeliberately provided false information in a security interview, a favorable security clearance\ndecision could not be rendered without the Judge articulating a rational basis for why it would be\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant\ndespite the falsifications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12329 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2003).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On\nOctober 31, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On March 14, 2019, after considering the record, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a Federal defense contractor.  He received a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2015.  He has not previously held a security clearance.  He admitted the SOR\nallegation that he used marijuana with varying frequency from the fall of 2011 to mid 2017.  He\ndenied the allegation that he intends to use marijuana in the future.  In his 2016 securiy clearance\napplication (SCA), he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question that asked whether he used any illegal drugs\nor controlled substances in the last seven years.  During a background interview, he told the\ninvestigator that he used marijuana once or twice a week during college, that he purchased marijuana\nat least once, and that he stopped using marijuana in 2015 while looking for employment.  About six\nmonths after obtaining his current job, he resumed using marijuana and used it within 30 days of the\ninterview.\nDuring the background interview, Applicant also told the investigator that he had no\nimmediate plans to stop using marijuana and intended to move to a location where it is legal.  After\nbeing advised that marijuana use is a violation of Federal law, he indicated he would cease using it\nif he had to do so in order to hold a security clearance.  Additionally, he told the investigator that he\nfailed to disclose his marijuana use on his SCA because he was trying to hide it. In his response to\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), he indicated that he has abstained from\nmarijuana since his interview, that he has disassociated from his college crowd, and that he now\nassociates with professionals. He submitted a statement of intent to refrain from illegal drugs in the\nfuture and acknowledged that further drug involvement would be grounds for revoking his security\nclearance.  In a urinalysis conducted in January 2019, he tested negative for illegal drugs.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s drug use is recent, frequent, and did not occur under circumstances making it \nunlikely to recur.  He has not corroborated his claims of disassociating with marijuana-using college\nassociates and becoming involved in other social circles.  The Judge indicated that he was not\nsatisfied that Applicant\u2019s assertions were credible, noting that Applicant appeared to be willing to\nsay what was necessary to obtain a security clearance.  The Judge also noted that, while falsification\n2\n\nwas not alleged, Applicant\u2019s admitted SCA falsification could be used for certain limited purposes\nsuch as assessing his credibility.  Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline H security concerns.   \n  \nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  He argues that the Judge used\nhis request for a decision on the written record \u201cas a reason to doubt [his] credibility and sincerity.\u201d\nAppeal Brief at 1.  He contends that the Judge should not have used that request to evaluate his\ncredibility and states that he \u201cwas not exempt from having a potential hearing if requested by the\n[J]udge assigned to the case.\u201d  Id.  These arguments lack merit.  First, the Directive provides that a\nhearing may be requested by the applicant or by Department Counsel.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.4; E3.1.7. \nThere is no provision for a Judge to convene a hearing on his own motion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n15-05047 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017).  Second, there is no basis for concluding that the Judge used\nApplicant\u2019s forum choice as a factor in making his credibility determination.  In his whole-person\nanalysis, the Judge stated that, because no hearing was held in this case, he \u201chad no opportunity to\nevaluate [Applicant\u2019s] credibility and sincerity based on demeanor.\u201d  Decision at 6, citing ISCR Case\nNo. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003).  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s statement.  Third, the\nJudge also noted that Applicant\u2019s varying positions regarding his future use of marijuana and his\nadmitted falsification of his drug use on his SCA.  These were matters the Judge could properly\nconsider in making a credibility determination.  Fourth, the Directive provides that the Appeal Board\nshall give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  None of the issues raised by Applicant\nare sufficient for us to set aside that deference.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant also contends the Judge erred in his whole-person analysis.  He\nargues that his behavior has changed and that the Judge focused on his past, as opposed to his more\nrecent conduct.  In his argument, he highlights, for example, that he had a negative urinalysis test in\nearly 2019, he has changed his social circles, and he has signed a statement of intent to abstain from\nillegal drug involvement.  These points amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  It is well established that the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

I did not find that testimony to be credible.\u201d  Decision at 6.  He has\nsubstantial assets available to pay his delinquent debts.  He deliberately ignored creditors between\n2014 and 2018, while amassing a large investment portfolio.  The second mortgage still has not been\nsatisfied.  \nDiscussion    \nApplicant contends that Judge erred in four of his findings and conclusions.  We examine\nfinding of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094\nat 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018). \n(1) Applicant contends that the Judge erred in a finding regarding the timing of his efforts\nto resolve the second mortgage.  On Page 3 of the Decision, the Judge found that, \u201c[a]fter his\nclearance interview in June 2018, Applicant began to put the pieces together and realized that\n[Creditor X] was a collection agent for [the original mortgage lender] or its successor creditors.\u201d \nApplicant argues that he did not determine that Creditor X was the holder of the second mortgage\nuntil February 2019, which explains why he did not take any earlier action.  In essence, he is\ncontending the Judge used an eight-month period of inaction (i.e., the period between Applicant\u2019s\nbackground interview in June 2018 and his claimed date for identifying the creditor in February\n2019) to conclude he did not act responsibly in addressing the second mortgage.  He categorizes the\neight-month period as an \u201cerror.\u201d We do not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.  In this regard,\nit should be noted that we do not consider individual sentences in a decision in isolation.  Rather,\nwe look at each aspect of a decision in light of the whole and interpret individual portions in their\nproper context.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-13664 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2013).  In the decision,\nthe Judge does not mention that eight-month period in his analysis.  In fact, there is scant reason to\nbelieve that specific time period was an independent factor in the Judge\u2019s decision.  Instead, in\nexamining whether Applicant acted responsibly in addressing the second mortgage, the Judge\nfocused on the four-year period from when Applicant received the demand for the balance due on\nboth foreclosed mortgages in 2014 (which he discarded without conducting any inquiry) to when he\neventually contacted the creditor in late 2018 and early 2019.  Based on our review of the record, the\nApplicant has failed to show that the eight-month period standing alone had any impact on the\nJudge\u2019s decision.  \n3\n\n(2) Applicant contends that the Judge erred by \u201cdoubling\u201d the correct amount of his assets.\nAppeal Brief at 8.  On Page 3 of the Decision, the Judge found that Applicant had \u201ca stocks and\nbonds investment portfolio and 401(k) account statement reflecting that [he] has assets valued at well\nover $2 million, plus other bank account and IRA statements showing his substantial net worth.\u201d \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant challenges that finding by pointing to his testimony (Tr. at 23) that he\nhad about $1.2 million in stocks and bonds.  We note that, on a Personal Financial Statement\nsubmitted with his SOR response, Applicant listed his total assets as being over $1,742,000, which\nincluded real estate, stocks and bonds, and other assets.  Even though the Judge may have\nmiscalculated Applicant\u2019s total assets, this was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the\noutcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  The key\npoint is that Applicant had substantial assets to resolve the second mortgage but had not done so by\nthe close of the record.  \n(3) Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  In doing so, he contends the\nJudge erred in concluding that \u201c[he] testified . . . that if delinquent debts aged off his credit report,\nthey were closed.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 9, quoting from Decision at 6.  He asserts that nowhere in the\nrecord can such testimony be found, and he also points to a portion of his testimony (Tr. at 73) in\nwhich he indicated that he was unaware debts age off credit reports.  He argues that the Judge\u2019s error\nregarding his position about the aging off of debts from credit reports was a significant factor that\ncontributed to the Judge making a flawed credibility determination.  We do not find this assignment\nof error convincing.  Of note, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief quotes from only portions of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision and the transcript that are pertinent to his claim.  In determining whether the Judge\ncommitted harmful error, we will examine the record in its entirety.  As quoted above, the full text\nof the Judge\u2019s sentence at issue reads as follows:  \u201c[Applicant] testified that he thought charged-off\nmeant forgiven, and that if delinquent debts aged off his credit reports, they were closed.\u201d  Decision\nat 6.  At the hearing, Applicant testified in pertinent part as follows: \n[Applicant]:  . . .  And [a debt] was listed as charged off, which I didn\u2019t know what\ncharged off meant.  I thought charged off meant basically relief from debt, so it was\nforgiven.\u201d  [Tr. at 60.] \n* * *\n[Judge]:  Okay.  So, if I\u2019m understanding you correctly, this first came to your\nattention -- you thought it might have been waived or forgiven or something?\n[Applicant]: Yes, Your Honor.  [Tr. at 61.]\n* * *\n[Applicant]:  . . .  So, when both of them [debts] disappeared off of my credit report,\nthat is when I thought, well, it\u2019s all resolved.  \n[Judge]:  Well, you understand that debts age off your credit report, like after --  \n4\n\n[Applicant]:  Actually, I didn\u2019t know that.  I found that out after talking to him, after\ntalking to the investigator --  [Tr. at 73.]\nBased on a review of the record, Applicant\u2019s claim essentially boils down to a challenge to the\nJudge\u2019s use of the phrase \u201caged off\u201d in the sentence at issue.  We do not find Applicant\u2019s claim to\nbe of such significance as to warrant any corrective action.  Furthermore, we are required to give\ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Applicant has not provided\nus a sufficient reason to disturb that determination.\n(4) Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he \u201cdeliberately ignored creditors and\ncollection agents for the period between 2014 and 2018.\"  Appeal Brief at 11, quoting from Decision\nat 6.   He argues that there is no record evidence that he ignored creditors during that time period.\nUnder the Directive, however, Applicant had the burden to present witnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate proven security concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant\nhas not pointed to any evidence that shows he acted responsibly in addressing the two foreclosed\nmortgages during that time period.  We note he resolved the primary foreclosed mortgage in\nFebruary 2019, shortly before the hearing.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant ignored his creditors from 2014 to 2018 was a reasonable inference based on the\nevidence that was presented.  We conclude the Judge committed no error in reaching the challenged\nconclusion.      \nApplicant further contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by the weight of the\nevidence.  In doing so, he argues the decision was skewed due to the purported errors discussed\nabove, and he claims the Judge ignored the actions he has taken to resolve the foreclosed mortgages\nsince November 2018.  He also notes that he testified that he made efforts to resolve the debts in the\nsummer of 2018. In essence, he is arguing that he acted responsibly in addressing the foreclosed\nmortgages.   His arguments, however, are not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-00844 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.\n25, 2017).  Additionally, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge\nto make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).\nApplicant has failed to show the Judge committed any harmful error.  The record supports\na conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nthe decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 19, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn May 6, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had five delinquent student loans totaling approximately\n$57,000 and that he had an unpaid credit card judgment.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on\ntwo student loans totaling about $3,700 and found against him on the remaining debts.  The Judge\nsummarized the case as follows:\nApplicant has had difficulty repaying his student loans.  He had an agreement to\nsettle $127,795 in private student loans for only $10,966, but then could not make the\ninstallment payments.  A $1,304 credit-card judgment from January 2012 has yet to\nbe addressed.  More progress is needed toward resolving his debts.  Clearance is\ndenied.  [Decision at 1.]\nAs best we can discern, Applicant is contending that he was not given adequate notice that\nhis financial problems raised security concerns.  For example, he states:\nWhile at the defense contracting firm, I was given my interim clearance initially.  I\nwas never informed at any point in time that my financial issues were in question. \nEven when I had [my] hearing on April 5th, 2018, though he [presumably Department\nCounsel] mentioned that it is a reason that people lose their clearance, he never\nexpressed it to be why we were having the meeting, nor that my situation in particular\nshould bring about worry.  If so I would have prepared. [Appeal Brief at 3.]\nWe note, however, that Applicant received the SOR more than five months before the hearing.  The\nSOR advised Applicant that the DoD was unable to find it was clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him access to classified information because of the financial concerns listed in that\ndocument.  In November 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR by specifically addressing the listed\nfinancial concerns.  At the hearing, Applicant expressed no surprise about why the proceeding was\nbeing conducted.  On the contrary, he acknowledged in his opening statement that he \u201chad issues\nfinancially,\u201d indicated that he always intended to pay off his debts, and stated that he encountered\nsituations that made it hard for him to pay back his loans.  Tr. at 17.  As a related matter, we note that\nthe Judge discussed in her decision an unalleged private student loan.  She indicated that loan would\nnot be considered in applying the disqualifying conditions.   Decision at 8, Footnote 7.  Citing ISCR\nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), she properly noted that the unalleged student loan\ncould be considered for certain limited purposes; such as, in assessing Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation. \nThere is no reason to conclude the Judge erred in considering the unalleged student loan.  From our\nreview of the record, Applicant was provided adequate notice of the reasons for the hearing.  He has\nfailed to establish that he was denied the due process afforded him under the Directive.   \n2\n\nApplicant takes exception to the Judge\u2019s use of the term \u201conly\u201d to describe the amount of his\n$5 monthly payments under a student loan rehabilitation program.   He contends that the Judge\u2019s \nuse of that term was \u201cnot impartial.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 6.  To the extent that he is claiming the Judge\nwas biased, he has not rebutted the presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased.  More\nspecifically, his claim regarding the Judge\u2019s use of the term \u201conly\u201d is not sufficient to meet the heavy\nburden of persuasion on him to overcome the impartiality presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n12-09545 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2015).  \nApplicant raises other challenges to the Judge\u2019s decision.  For example, he disputes the\nJudge\u2019s statement that he \u201cwas walked off the job,\u201d contends the Judge did not address certain\nevidence, and argues the Judge did not properly weigh the evidence.  His arguments, however, are\nneither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record\nnor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. March 9, 2017).  Applicant\nhas not established that the Judge committed any error that is likely to affect the outcome of this\ncase. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Reports indicate he made good\nprogress and was compliant with rules and policies.  He accepted full responsibility for his action\nin 2004 and 2017 and is remorseful.  He attended three to four Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nmeetings a week and has a AA sponsor, although he has not attended an AA meeting lately.  He has\nnot had a drink since his latest DWI and made a pledge to abstain from the use of alcohol in the\nfuture. \nA witness, who has known Applicant for five years, stated he is trustworthy and reliable.

He takes responsibility for his actions and has completed an inpatient program, alcohol\ncounseling program, and probation.  He stopped drinking in 2017.

Specifically, she argues that the Judge\u2019s decision does not address important aspects of\nthe case that significantly weaken the favorable mitigation analysis and runs contrary to the weight\nof the evidence.  We agree.  \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).   \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered\nfor national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl\n2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nDepartment Counsel highlights that Applicant\u2019s first alcohol-related driving incident\noccurred when he drank approximately a quarter of a liter of rum at a friend\u2019s house before driving\na vehicle.  Tr. at 34-36.  Applicant testified that he was intoxicated on that occasion when the police\nstopped him.   Id.   During the second incident, the police detected alcohol on his breath when he was\nstopped for speeding after leaving a bar.  Tr. at 36-38.  He failed a field sobriety test, and a\nbreathalyzer test revealed his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .14%.  Id.  The most recent incident\noccurred when Applicant consumed about five and a half beers at a bar.  Tr. at 40.  Even though less\nthan a year earlier he completed a security clearance application in which he had to disclose his prior\nalcohol-related charges, he acknowledged that he did not think about those prior incidents before\ndriving on that occasion.  Tr. at 41 and Government Exhibit (GE) 1. When the police stopped him,\nhis BAC was .10%.  Tr. at 29 and 41.  In the Decision, the Judge\u2019s failure to address many of these\nsignificant aspects of the case weakens her mitigation analysis. \nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s recent period of sobriety does not negate the\nsecurity concerns arising from his lengthy history of drinking and driving.  In her analysis, the Judge\nconcluded that \u201c[a] two-year period free of drinking seems to be a reasonable period or benchmark\nupon which to best assess that Applicant is in control of his abstinence from alcohol and capable of\nresponsible judgment.\u201d  Decision at 5-6.  As we have previously stated, the Directive does not\n3\n\nspecify how much time must pass to mitigate the various types of misconduct identified in the\nadjudicative guidelines.  Contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion, the Board has repeatedly declined to\nestablish a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201cbright-line\u201d rule for evaluating the recency of misconduct.  The extent\nto which security concerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question that\nmust be resolved based on the evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at 4 (App.\nBd. Sep. 20, 2019).  Regarding Applicant\u2019s recent two-year period of abstinence from alcohol,\nDepartment Counsel notes that Applicant had a four-year gap between his first two alcohol-related\ndriving offenses and 13-year gap between the last two offenses.  Moreover, Applicant testified that,\nafter his second alcohol-related incident, he abstained from drinking and driving for approximately\nsix years because the \u201cramifications\u201d of that incident were \u201cvery fresh in [his] mind.\u201d  Tr. at 52-53. \nHowever, as time passed, he stated that he \u201cfelt more comfortable having a couple of drinks and\ndriving.\u201d  Id. and 48.  The Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis is undercut by her failure to address that\nApplicant changed his problematic behavior for a number of years following the second incident,\nbut then again exercised poor judgment by reverting to drinking and driving.  In light of this prior\nbehavior, the Judge did not adequately explain how the circumstances have sufficiently changed\nfollowing the third incident to remove pertinent doubts.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge gave undue credit to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related\ncounseling and treatment.  First, it merits noting that Applicant had already completed an eight to\nten week alcohol/drug treatment and counseling program before his third alcohol-related incident. \nSecond, following his third incident, Applicant hired an attorney and participated in a weekend\nalcohol intervention program before his court proceeding.  The intervention program recommended\nthat Applicant attend a minimum of two AA meetings weekly and complete a structured, aftercare\noutpatient program.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A; GE 3, Tr. at 44.  Third, Department Counsel notes,\nsince Applicant completed his court-ordered treatment requirements, most of which was completed\nby March 2018, he has not attended any AA meetings, spoken with his AA sponsor, or received\nalcohol-related counseling or treatment.  AE B, D, F and Tr. at 43-46.  Finally, most of Applicant\u2019s\nrecent two-year period of abstinence from alcohol occurred either while he was serving court-ordered\nprobation that required him to abstain from alcohol (AE C and Tr. at 42) or while he was on notice\nthrough the issuance of the SOR that his security clearance was in jeopardy because of his alcohol-\nrelated incidents.  In the Decision, the Judge did not either directly or adequately address these\nfactors that detract from her favorable mitigation analysis.     \nIn his reply brief, Applicant makes several arguments which rely on the premise that the\nGovernment has a burden to disprove assertions Applicant offered in his case in mitigation.  Such\na premise is mistaken.  Applicant has the burden of producing evidence to mitigate facts admitted\nby him or otherwise proven by Department Counsel (here, the DUI events).  Furthermore, Applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nhim a favorable clearance decision.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 and Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(c). \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant drove vehicles on three occasions while impaired\nby alcohol between 2000 and 2017.  Given Applicant\u2019s drinking and driving history and the\ncircumstances of his latest alcohol counseling and treatment, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\ntwo-year period of abstinence was sufficient to establish his alcohol-related misconduct was behind\nhim is not sustainable.  From our review of the record, we conclude the Judge\u2019s favorable decision\nis arbitrary and capricious because it fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs contrary\n4\n\nto the weight of the record evidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record evidence, viewed\nas a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard. \nThe decision is not sustainable.\n5\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James  E.

In that\nemail, she indicated that her eye movements were being tracked at work, which she believed also\ntracked her emotions.  The email also indicated that she was being monitored in other ways.  She\nnoted that the tracking was draining her mentally, physically, and emotionally and that she could not\nfunction properly knowing such monitoring was occurring.

A psychiatrist\n\u201ccould confirm no psychiatric contraindication to [Applicant] performing her job[.]\u201d   Decision at\n2-3, quoting Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.

She claims it contains inaccurate\ninformation and misrepresents her statements.  She indicated that she would not oppose treatment\nif she felt it were necessary, but she believes it is not necessary.    \nApplicant failed to rebut the findings in the psychologist\u2019s evaluation.  None of the mitigating\nconditions alleviate the alleged security concerns.  \nDiscussion\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is against the great weight\nof the evidence introduced at the hearing and is contrary to law.  She reiterates the challenges that\nshe raised at the hearing to psychologist\u2019s evaluation by stating it is inaccurate and misquotes her\nstatements.  She asserts the evaluation was not independent, was extremely biased against her, and\nmis-diagnosed her.  She cites to no record evidence in support of her assertions that the evaluation\nwas not independent and was biased against her.  She indicates that she has continued to work for\nthe past three-and-a-half years without any problems.  We note that Applicant did not object to the\n2\n\nadmission of psychological evaluation into evidence at the hearing.  Tr. at 18-19.  Her challenges\non appeal do not go towards the admission of the psychological evaluation into evidence; instead,\nthey go to the amount of weight it should be given.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\n\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nNovember 19, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On July 25, 2019, after the hearing, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in the findings of\nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He has never been married and\nhas no children.  He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and is pursuing a master\u2019s degree.  The SOR\nalleges five alcohol-related incidents of criminal conduct between 2012 and 2017.  Applicant\nadmitted the allegations in his SOR response.  \nWhen Applicant was 19 years old in 2012, he was cited twice for alcohol-related conduct.\nIn the first incident, he pled guilty to criminal damage and a minor with alcohol in body.  He was\nplaced in a diversion program and required to attend alcohol-education classes.  The second incident\ninvolved him pleading guilty to minor with alcohol in body after the car in which he was a passenger\nwas stopped by police.  He paid a small fine and was again required to attend an alcohol-education\nclass.  About two years later, he was arrested for public nuisance-obstruction of property and failure\nto obey a police officer.  For the third incident, he pled guilty to the public nuisance charge and was\nordered to pay a fine. \nAt age 22, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault on a peace\nofficer (non-serious injury) for spitting in the officer\u2019s face.  This occurred after he and his girlfriend\nhad a noisy disagreement in her apartment for which the police were called.  The police described\nApplicant as quite intoxicated and combative.  In his security clearance application (SCA), he stated,\nhe \u201caccidentally spat in the direction of another person with no foul intentions.\u201d  Decision at 3,\nquoting Government Exhibit (GE) 1.  At the hearing, Applicant explained his characterization of the\nincident as \u201caccidental\u201d was due to an oversight.  The Judge found that explanation to be not\ncredible.   Applicant pled guilty to attempted assault and was sentenced to 18 months probation and\nrequired to attend alcohol-education classes.  His probation was terminated after 12 months and the\noffense was designated a misdemeanor.  \nThe fifth incident occurred when Applicant was age 24 and was working for his current\nemployer.  After crashing his car into a wall, he was arrested for driving under the influence of\n2\n\nalcohol.  He refused to take a breath test.  The police report reflect that Applicant initially ignored\ncommands at the scene and was restrained.  He pled guilty to a DUI offense and was sentenced to\nserve 30 days in jail (28 days suspended), 12 months probation, and a required alcohol/substance\nabuse evaluation.  Applicant did not recall if he received any diagnosis regarding his alcohol use. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s motion, his conviction for DUI was set aside in 2018.  \nAt the hearing, Applicant took full responsibility for his misconduct and lack of judgment.\nHe noted he could count on one hand how many times he used alcohol in the past six months.  His\nultimate goal is to abstain from alcohol given the problems it has caused him.  He has a plan to avoid\nsituations where alcohol is served and to not drink and drive.  He has a good employment record. \nHis supervisor describes him as forthright and dependable.  \nWhile noting that Applicant presented a decent case in mitigation, including evidence of\nreform and rehabilitation as well as the passage of time since the last incident, the Judge concluded\nthe frequency and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents weighed heavily against him.\nHis conduct demonstrates a pattern of behavior that calls into question his reliability, trustworthiness,\ngood judgment, and ability or willingness to comply with laws and regulations.  \u201cSimply stated, it\nis too soon to tell if he will continue responsible use of alcohol and conduct himself as a law-abiding\nperson.\u201d  Decision at 7.   \nDiscussion\nApplicant asserts the Judge erred in finding that he was seeking a security clearance for the\nfirst time.  In support of this assertion, he points to his testimony in which he informed the Judge that\nhe was seeking to retain an existing clearance.  Tr. at 5-6.  He argues that, because of the error\nregarding his clearance status, the Judge did not apply the factors in Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(f)\nthat an adjudicator should consider in evaluating a security concern involving an individual who\nholds a security clearance.  We do not find this argument persuasive.  Applicant has not pointed to\nany applicable factor listed in \u00b6 2(f) that the Judge did not consider.  To the contrary, the Judge\u2019s\ndecision touches on a number of those factors.  Also, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of\nthe evidence in the record and need not discuss all of the analytical factors set forth in the Directive. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02236 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).  While the Judge erred in making\na finding about Applicant\u2019s clearance status, it was a harmless error because it did not likely affect\nthe outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).\nApplicant next notes that the first four of his alcohol-related incidents were adjudicated prior\nto him being granted a security clearance in April 2017.  To the extent that Applicant may be arguing\nthat those incidents should no longer be considered, we do not find that argument persuasive.  The\nBoard has previously held that there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a presumption in\nfavor of continuing or granting a security clearance.  Moreover, the Government has the right to\nreconsider the security significance of past conduct in light of more recent conduct having negative\nsecurity significance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2005).  Applicant\nhas not established that the Judge erred in considering each of the five alleged alcohol-related\nincidents to evaluate his current security clearance eligibility. \n3\n\nApplicant also highlights the passage of time since his last alcohol-related incident and\nargues the decision is arbitrary because \u201cno quantifiable baseline is provided to indicate how much\ntime needs to pass to achieve a certain confidence level of non-reoccurring incidents.\u201d  Appeal Brief\nat 3.  Security clearance decisions, however, are not an exact science, but rather are predictive\njudgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present\ncircumstances. Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  The Board has\nrepeatedly declined to furnish \"bright-line\" guidance regarding the concept of recency.  The extent\nto which security concerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question that\nmust be resolved based on the evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01847 at 3 (App.\nBd. Apr. 9, 2015).  In this case, we note a period of over two years elapsed between Applicant\u2019s last\ntwo incidents.  Considering the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s determination that insufficient time has\npassed to conclude that Applicant is unlikely to engage in further misconduct was not arbitrary or\ncapricious.\nApplicant further argues that, due to the error regarding his clearance status, the Judge did\nnot consider his three-year record as a clearance holder without any security violations.  Additionally,\nhe contends that, while the Judge discussed aspects of Mitigating Condition 23(b) in the decision,\nhe failed to list it specifically in his decision.1  These also were, at most, harmless errors.  The\nJudge\u2019s main findings and conclusions \u2013 that Applicant was involved in five alcohol-related\nincidents of criminal conduct between 2012 and 2017; that those incidents raise significant questions\nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with the law; and\nthat insufficient time has passed to conclude that he will use alcohol responsibly in the future and\nbe a law-abiding citizen \u2013 are sustainable.\nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Egan at 528.

The SOR alleged that Applicant had five delinquent debts that included a student loan placed for collection for about $26,200 and a state tax lien for about $3,400. He denied the SOR allegations. Applicant stated he had a $5 payment plan in place for the student loan. He submitted a 2019 billing statement that showed he was behind $5 on the payment plan and the account\u2019s balance was over $31,900.

Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On August 14, 2019, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nNoreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her analysis of the\nevidence.   Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a Federal contractor.  He is married with two adult\nchildren.  The SOR alleged that Applicant had five delinquent debts that included a student loan\nplaced for collection for about $26,200 and a state tax lien for about $3,400.  He denied the SOR\nallegations. \nApplicant stated he had a $5 payment plan in place for the student loan.  He submitted a 2019\nbilling statement that showed he was behind $5 on the payment plan and the account\u2019s balance was\nover $31,900.  During a background interview, he stated he did not take the student loan seriously. \nApplicant claimed he paid the state tax lien in 2018, but failed to submit evidence to support this\nclaim.

The removal of the medical debt from his credit report does not establish the debt\nwas resolved.  Applicant claims he disputed a collection account for about $1,050 with the three\ncredit reporting bureaus and it is no longer listed on his credit reports.  He claims a collection\naccount for about $220 was removed from his credit report, but did not submit any documentation\nshowing a dispute.  \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he owed about $22,000 in\nFederal and state taxes and was making monthly payments.  In his background interview, he stated\nhe had delinquent taxes for 2008 through 2010.  He provided tax transcripts that did not show any\nrecent payments.   He satisfied a Federal tax lien for about $14,300 in 2016.  He did not submit a\nresponse to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).  He did not provide\ninformation about either receiving financial counseling or his monthly income and expenditures.  \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n2\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports and other documents establish the alleged debts.  He blamed his\ndebts on a divorce, but did not provide the date of the divorce or establish a sufficient connection\nbetween that event and his debts.  He has not shown that he is financially stable or that his financial\nsituation is under control.  He has been steadily employed since 2013, but did not take action on the\ndebts until 2018.

Russia\u2019s intelligence services as well as private\ncompanies and other entities frequently seek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties\nto Russia who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets.\u201d  Decision at 3-4. \nThey offer financial incentives to U.S. citizens to encourage them to compromise classified\ninformation.  Russia also has significant human-rights problems, marked by abuses such as forced\nconfessions, torture, and prisoner mistreatment.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nConsidering Russia\u2019s relationship with the United States, its intelligence collection\noperations, and its human rights record, Applicant\u2019s parents living in Russia creates security\nconcerns under Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b).  Applicant has substantial family ties to\n2\n\nRussia.  He could be placed in a position to have to choose between the interests of his parents and\nthose of the United States.  He did not meet his burden of establishing that he has deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States.  The circumstances tending to support\nthe granting of Applicant\u2019s security clearance are less significant than those weighting towards its\ndenial. \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends the Judge\u2019s conclusions are speculative.  In challenging the Judge\u2019s\noverall decision, he claims security concerns arising from his parents living in Russia are \u201cHIGHLY\nunlikely\u201d and based on potential rather than actual risk.  Appeal Brief at 1.  These arguments are not\npersuasive.  Security clearance adjudications involve predictive judgments about a person\u2019s\nsuitability in light of that person\u2019s past conduct and present circumstances.  The U.S. Supreme Court\nhighlighted this concept in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988), by stating:\nA clearance does not equate with passing judgment upon an individual's character.\nInstead, it is only an attempt to predict his possible future behavior and to assess\nwhether, under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons, he might\ncompromise sensitive information.  It may be based, to be sure, upon past or present\nconduct, but it also may be based upon concerns completely unrelated to conduct,\nsuch as having close relatives residing in a country hostile to the United States.  \u201c[T]o\nbe denied [clearance] on unspecified grounds in no way implies disloyalty or any\nother repugnant characteristic.\u201d Molerio v. FBI, 242 U.S. App. D.C. 137, 146, 749\nF.2d 815, 824 (1984).  The attempt to define not only the individual's future actions,\nbut those of outside and unknown influences renders the \u201cgrant or denial of security\nclearances . . . an inexact science at best.\u201d  Adams v. Laird, 136 U.S. App. D.C. 388,\n397, 420 F.2d 230, 239 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).\nIn responding to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant \nobjected to matters in that document.  In the decision, the Judge stated \u201cApplicant\u2019s objections to\nthe \u2018Facts\u2019 and \u2018Argument\u2019 sections of the FORM are not proper objections, but rather are arguments\nsupporting why he should receive a clearance.  Those objections are overruled.\u201d  Decision at 2.  In\nhis appeal, Applicant takes exception to the Judge\u2019s decision to overrule his objections.  We find no\nerror in the Judge\u2019s ruling.  The Facts and Argument sections in the FORM do not constitute\nevidence, but are Department Counsel\u2019s arguments.  As we have stated in the past, an error in a\nFORM, as opposed to one in a Judge\u2019s decision, is not an appealable issue.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n15-00535 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017).   \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant also objected to Department Counsel\u2019s request for\nthe Judge to take administrative notice of certain facts pertaining to Russia.  Applicant argued the\nadministrative notice documents had nothing to do with him personally.  The Judge separately\naddressed and overruled that objection.  We find no error that ruling.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\n6 provides that, in Guideline B cases, \u201c[a]ssessment of foreign contacts and interests should consider\nthe country in which the foreign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to,\n3\n\nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive\ninformation or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  It is well established that a Judge may take\nadministrative notice of facts about a foreign country from official U.S. Government publications\nwhen conducting that foreign influence assessment.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4, n.1\n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007).   \nApplicant raises challenges to other aspects of the Judge\u2019s decision.  For example, he\ndisputes that Judge\u2019s statement that he declined to renounce his Russian citizenship because he was\nnever required to do so; he takes exception to the Judge\u2019s statement that he is \u201cvery close\u201d to his\nparents because that is a matter of speculation; he argues that having parents in Russia does not place\nhim in a position of having to choose between their interests and those of the United States, and he\nchallenges the Judge\u2019s determination that he has not established deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the United States.  These arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence.  Viewed in its entirety, Applicant\u2019s brief advocates for an alternative\ninterpretation of the record evidence, which is not enough to show the Judge weighed the evidence\nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at\n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).   \nApplicant notes that he was granted a security clearance in 2011, and the security concerns\nregarding his parents arose during a reinvestigation.  He indicated that he is confused why those\nsecurity concerns are now being raised.   In this regard, we note that no one has a right to a security\nclearance.  Egan at 528.  Nor does a prior favorable security clearance decision give rise to a vested\nright or interest in continued retention of a security clearance.  To the extent that Applicant's\nargument could be construed as raising the question whether DoD is equitably estopped from\ndenying or revoking his security clearance, it is unpersuasive because the Federal Government is not\nbarred from denying or revoking access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n19823 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 3, 2003)(citing prior Board decisions).  Consequently, Applicant\u2019s prior\nfavorable adjudication in 2011 does not entitle him to continued retention of a security clearance. \nHe also notes that he has \u201ca lot riding on the decision.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  The Directive, however,\ndoes not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n02619 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 7, 2016).  \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Egan at 528.  See also\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national\nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\n4\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan            \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nNovember 20, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Neither Applicant nor\nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing.  On April 23, 2019, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a Federal contractor.  She is separated from her\nhusband and has an adult child.  The SOR alleged that she had 18 delinquent accounts totaling about\n$92,000, including about $80,000 in student loans.  In her SOR response, she admitted some debts, \ndenied others, and provided proof of paying one debt.  She attributed her financial problems to her\nseparation and her husband\u2019s failure to follow through on his promises to pay bills.  In 2015, she was\ngranted a security clearance following a DOHA proceeding in which she showed that she\nexperienced unemployment due to medical problems and claimed she was the victim of identity\ntheft.  During a background interview in 2018, she indicated that she thought her student loans were\nin deferment, did not know the origin of the other debts, but indicated she would investigate them. \nShe did not submit a response to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) or present\nany plan for resolving the debts.  She has not shown that she acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.  None of the mitigating conditions apply in this case.       \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains a document and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.  \nApplicant contends that she was only an authorized user on specific delinquent credit card\naccounts listed on the SOR.  However, a review of the credit reports in the record do not support her\ncontention.  She has not shown the Judge erred in finding against her on those accounts.  \nApplicant argues that she was not aware that she should have provided a plan for paying her\ndebts.  This argument shows no error on the part of the Judge.  Although pro se applicants cannot\nbe expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their\nrights under the Directive.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 17-02196 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2018). \nApplicant further contends the loss of her security clearance will have a negative impact on her. \nHowever, the Directive does not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 11-13180 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 21, 2013).  The balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments\namounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  These arguments are not\n2\n\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \n \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.

On\nMarch 12, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  After initially requesting a decision on the\nwritten record, Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 24, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on an allegation that\nhas not been raised as an issue on appeal and is not discussed below.  Consistent with the following,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in her early 30s, works for a company that is sponsoring her for a security\nclearance.  She was born and raised in one of the former republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics (USSR).  She later moved to Russia and obtained Russian citizenship to qualify for social\nbenefits.  She lived there for about five years before immigrating to the United States.  She became\na U.S. citizen in 2015.  She indicated that she is willing to renounce her Russian citizenship but has\nnot taken any steps to do so. Her husband and children are U.S. citizens.  She and her husband have\nabout $800,000 of assets in the United States.  She has no assets in Russia. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents lived in Russia for many years.  Her father retired from a skilled trade\nposition.  Through her sponsorship, her parents obtained permanent resident status in the United\nStates in 2018.  Her father later returned to Russia for medical treatment.  At the time of the hearing,\nshe believed he would return to the United States later in 2019.  He receives a $125 monthly pension\nfrom the Russian Government.    \nApplicant has two siblings.  One is a Russian citizen who works for the Russian Government\nin a low-level position.  Applicant communicates with this sibling on a weekly or monthly basis. \nHer other sibling is a Russian citizen who is a permanent resident of the United States.  \nSince the breakup of the USSR, Russia shifted to a centralized authoritarian state under its\npresident.  In 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center  identified Russia as one\nof the three most capable and active cyber actors involved in economic espionage and reported that\nRussia conducted sophisticated, large-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and\ntechnology information.  In 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) assessed\nthat Russia will employ a variety of aggressive tactics to bolster its standing and weaken the United\nStates.  ODNI also reported that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election\nrepresent a significant escalation in Russia\u2019s desire to undermine U.S.-led liberal democratic order\nand assessed the Russian intelligence services will continue to develop capabilities to provide its\n\npresident with options to use against the United States.  The State Department assessed Moscow as\nbeing a high-threat location for terrorist activity directed at U.S. Government interests.  Russian also\nhas significant human-rights issues, including extrajudicial killings, systematic torture, arbitrary\narrest and detention, severe restrictions on freedom expression and the media, and widespread\ncorruption at all government levels. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living or visiting Russia create a heightened\nrisk of foreign inducement, manipulation, etc. and a potential conflict of interest. Mitigating\nCondition 8(b) partially applies because of her relationships and loyalties in the United States.  She\nhas resided here for about nine years.  Her husband and children are U.S. citizens and her assets are\nlocated in the United States.  However, she has close relationships with family members in Russia,\nand they are at risk because of Russian intelligence operatives, terrorists, and human rights\nviolations.  The evidence that Applicant presented is not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence\nsecurity concerns.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusions based on the Government\u2019s request for\nadministrative notice of facts pertaining to Russia are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.1  In\nthis regard, Applicant quotes from a number of paragraphs in the Judge\u2019s Decision and argues that,\n\u201c[a]bsent supporting evidence, it is incorrect to postulate that \u2018[t]he risk of coercion, persuasion, or\nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government . . . .\u2019\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 4-5, quoting Decision at 11.  However, along with other factors, the nature of the foreign\ngovernment in question is an important considerations in foreign influence cases because it provides\ncontext for other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions\nin the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017).  Moreover, as a\nmatter of common sense, it is fair to say that the risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion is greater when the foreign country involved has an authoritarian government. \nThe Appeal Board has recognized this concept in prior cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-24933\nat 5-6 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006); ISCR Case\nNo. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 17, 2006); and ISCR Case No. 06-17164 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 21,\n2007).  In this case, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s challenged conclusion.\nApplicant also argues that \u201ca \u2018heightened risk\u2019 to U.S. national security should only exist \n\u201c. . . if there is an actual, rather than potential, threat from the foreign country of targeting U.S.\ncitizens for the purpose of obtaining protected information through coercion, persuasion, or duress\n. . . .\u201d (Appeal Brief at 5), that no evidence of an actual threat of this type was presented below, and\n1 In the Decision, the Judge noted that Applicant objected to the relevancy of information in the Government\u2019s\nrequest for administrative notice.  In addressing that issue, the Judge stated, \u201cApplicant\u2019s objections go to the weight and\nnot the admissibility of the Government\u2019s administrative notice request.\u201d  Decision at 3.  On appeal, Applicant\u2019s\nchallenges to the Judge\u2019s conclusions based on the administrative notice request also go to the matter of the weight that\nshould be given to, rather than the admissibility of, the documents or information in question.     \n\nthat the administrative notice request only presented evidence of a potential threat.  We do not find\nthis argument persuasive.  First, Applicant cites no authority that directly supports her argument. \nSecond, security clearance adjudications are not an exact science, but rather are predictive judgments\nabout a person\u2019s suitability in light of that person\u2019s past conduct and present circumstances. \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Third, the word \u201cpotential\u201d is used\nin the Guideline B disqualifying conditions.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 7(b).  Fourth, the\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or circumstances\nunder any guideline and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is\nnot required.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2018).  Fifth, it is well\nsettled that the Federal Government is not required to wait until there is a present case, or imminent\nthreat, of espionage or attempted espionage before it can deny or revoke access to classified\ninformation for a given applicant.  More specifically, the Government need not present evidence that\na foreign country is currently targeting a particular applicant to obtain access to protected\ninformation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-09907 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2004).   Finally, as a matter\nof common sense, a potential threat of foreign exploitation under given circumstances may be\nsufficient to create questions or doubts about an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, and such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of national security.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).\nSimilarly, the Board reviewed language in a case where the Judge appeared to distinguish between\n\u201cheightened risk\u201d and \u201cpotential heightened risk.\u201d  We noted that risk encompasses potential\noutcomes.  We did not find a meaningful distinction between \u201cheightened risk\u201d and \u201cpotential\nheightened risk.\u201d  See, ISCR Case No. 14-02149 at 6-7, n.8 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2019).   Based on our\nreview of the record, Applicant has not established that the Judge erred in his assessment of the\nsecurity risks posed by her relatives residing in Russia.\nApplicant further argues that the Judge did not specifically consider Mitigating Condition\n8(a), although he listed it in his Decision as a mitigating condition that could possibly apply.  This\nargument does not establish error below.  As we have previously stated, a Judge is not required to\ndiscuss all of the analytical factors set forth in the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02236 at\n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).       \nAdditionally, Applicant argues that the Judge erred because the evidence in support of\nMitigating Conditions 8(a), 8(b), and the whole-person concept was \u201cso powerful as to be\noverwhelming.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 5.  In making these arguments, she asserts, for example, that none\nof her foreign relatives are politically active and points out that none of them has done anything to\nattract the attention of a foreign government.  We have previously noted that the relative obscurity\nof foreign family members does not provide a meaningful measure of whether Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances pose a security risk.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb 28, 2019). \nIn general, Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence and advocate for an alternative interpretation of the record evidence, which is not enough\nto show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).   \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\n\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Egan at 528.

Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born in Iraq.  He entered the United States illegally and shortly thereafter\napplied for political asylum.  He, his wife, and their children became U.S. citizens about nine years\nago.  He has worked for defense contractors in Iraq for various periods between 2006 and 2011,\nincluding in combat areas where he was subjected to indirect fire.

He testified that his contact with this sibling was solely professional in nature. \nHe has not talked to his foreign siblings since at least 2014.  He is described as a dedicated\nprofessional and has received certificates of appreciation and letters of recommendation.\n  \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack Iraqi security\nforces and civilians.

Iraq\nalso has widespread corruption and human rights problems.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\n\u201cApplicant has ongoing familial connections with his three siblings and their families [in\nIraq].

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On April\n25, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On September 9, 2019, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nDarlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.   Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues in her appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings\nof fact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in her 40s, began working for her current employer, a defense contractor,\nin early 2019.  She is a military retiree and held a security clearance during her military career\nwithout incident.  She is married with a minor child.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 14 delinquent debts totaling about $22,000.  In\nresponding to the SOR, she admitted each allegation.  She attributed those debts to various events\nthat included a prior marriage in which her husband had bad credit and the marital debts were placed\nin her name.  When they divorced, she was left with approximately $20,000 in debt.  After her\ndivorce, she became pregnant and had a premature child.  The most significant financial setback\noccurred when her father was diagnosed with a serious illness that prompted Applicant to request\na humanitarian reassignment, which resulted in moving and child care expenses.  She also assisted\nher father financially.  At some point, she married again and attempted to maintain two households\nin different states.  When she rented her house, the tenants failed to pay the rent and utility bills.  She\nand her husband also incurred medical problems that interfered with their ability to work.  \nApplicant sought credit counseling, but cancelled that program as a result of contractual\nissues.   She noted that most of the debts were included in the credit counseling program.  For four\nof those debts, she indicated that she intended to resolve them as soon as possible.  For four other\ndebts, she stated she either paid or is currently paying them, but provided no proof.  She disputes one\ndebt but provided no documentation of the dispute.  She wanted to dispute another debt but has now\ndecided to pay it.  \nApplicant noted that she has paid other debts not listed in the SOR.  She prepared a budget \nthat includes each of the delinquent debts without submitting any proof of those payments.  She\nbelieves that she will be able to have all of the debts paid within one year if her security clearance\nis granted.   Professional associates and friends attest to her integrity and describe her as reliable and\ntrustworthy.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were partially caused by circumstances beyond her control.\nHowever, she does not explain specifically what she is doing to resolve them.  She has not provided\nproof of payment, payment plans, or letters from the creditors that confirm the debts are being\n2\n\nresolved.  It cannot be determined that her debts are under control.  There is no clear evidence that\nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances.  Her inactions raise unmitigated security concerns.\nDiscussion    \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  She argues such information is not new evidence but rather it is supplemental information\nthat was not available at the time she responded to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) and it substantiates facts previously provided.  This argument lacks merit.  Information not\npreviously submitted to the Judge for consideration constitutes \u201cnew evidence\u201d that the Appeal\nBoard cannot consider.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00287 at 2, n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2019).\nApplicant  contends that the Judge erred in finding that she had 14 delinquent debts when the\nSOR only listed ten debts.  This discrepancy appears to have been a typographical error.  In the\ndecision, the Judge discussed each of the ten alleged debts individually in the order they appeared\non the SOR.  Also on page 4, she noted that Applicant was \u201cmaking payments on the ten debts listed\nin the SOR.\u201d  The decision reflects the Judge knew the specific nature and extent of the allege debts. \nAlthough the Judge erred by initially indicating the SOR contained 14 debts, this was a harmless\nerror because it did not likely affect the outcome of the decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).   \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201cApplicant claims that she paid [the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.i] off in February 2018, but provides nothing more\u201d (Appeal Brief at 4, quoting from\nDecision at 4) and challenges a related conclusion that  \u201cApplicant states that one of the debts in the\nSOR has been paid off and the others remain owing\u201d (Appeal Brief at 4, quoting from Decision at\n7).  Applicant contends she never made that purported statement.  It appears the Judge may have\nconfused the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i with a non-alleged debt of a similar amount that Applicant told an\ninvestigator was paid in February 2018.  FORM Item 3.  Although the Judge apparently erred in a\nfinding and conclusion pertaining to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, these errors were also harmless.  The key\npoint here is that Applicant failed to submit proof showing the alleged debts were either resolved or\nbeing resolved.  \nApplicant argues the Judge erred by indicating Applicant submitted only three letters of\nrecommendation.  In the findings of fact, the Judge indicated there were \u201c[l]etters of\nrecommendation from professional associates and friends[.]\u201d  Decision at 4.  However, at the end\nof the paragraph discussing the letters of recommendation, the Judge  referenced only three exhibits\nas support for her findings.  Based on that reference, Applicant is contending the Judge only\nconsidered three of the letters of recommendation, while six were submitted.  We do not find this\nargument persuasive.   Judges have broad latitude and discretion in way they write their decisions. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-02752 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2010).  There is no requirement that the\nJudge cite every exhibit or piece of evidence that supports a finding of fact.  Morever, there is a\nrebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in a case unless the record clearly\ndemonstrates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01616 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2009).  In this\ncase, Applicant has failed to rebut that presumption. \n3\n\nApplicant notes that denial of her security clearance would affect her ability to pay her debts. \nThe Directive, however, does not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 11-13180 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 21, 2013).  She also highlights a sentence in an\ninvestigator\u2019s report, that states, \u201cThere is no reason for anyone to question the subject\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to repay her debts or live within her means, subject\u2019s current financial status is very\ngood.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 10, quoting from FORM Item 3.  The quoted sentence summarizes\nApplicant\u2019s answers to the interviewer.  It does not constitute the interviewer\u2019s opinion as to\nApplicant\u2019s financial situation or security worthiness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03069 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 30, 2015).  In any event, even if an investigator provided such an opinion it would not bind\nthe DoD in its evaluation of an applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant further contends that previously her\nsecurity clearance was mistakenly adjudicated as a \u201closs of jurisdiction,\u201d which later prompted the\ncurrent adjudication.  This does not establish any error in the Judge\u2019s decision.   The Government\nhas the right to examine an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility in light of recent conduct or\ncircumstances having negative security significance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 4 (App.\nBd. Jul. 12, 2007).  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  She asserts, for example, that the record evidence reflects payments toward non-\nalleged debts, that she chose to continue paying debts instead of hiring an attorney to represent her\nin this security clearance adjudication, and that the evidence shows a history of willingness to satisfy\nher debts.  Her arguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a\nmanner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2\n(App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).  \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The record\nsupports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On July 29, 2019, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Carol\nG. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts totaling about $85,800.  The\nJudge found in favor of Applicant on five of the debts, which are not at issue on appeal.  The Judge\nfound against Applicant on two student loans totaling about $66,700 that have been placed for\ncollection.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations involving the two student\nloans and indicated he was currently working on a payment plan with the creditor, did not have\ninformation to send about their status, and would be able to send information at a later date.  He\nsubmitted no further information on those loans. \nOn appeal, Applicant raises a due process issue.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Guideline I\nDIGEST: Department Counsel\u2019s argument is based on a faulty premise, i.e., an assumption not\nsupported by record evidence.  We first note that the SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to\nfollow a prescribed treatment plan so as to place this issue directly before the Judge. We also\nnote that Applicant was never asked at the hearing if she ceased taking Seroquel in contravention\nof the directions of medical professionals.  Department Counsel\u2019s brief cites no record evidence\nthat adequately supports a conclusion that Applicant failed to follow the directions of medical\nprofessionals in ceasing the use of that drug.  The fact that Dr. K\u2019s progress notes reflect\nApplicant should \u201ccontinue current meds\u201d and \u201ccontinue current treatment\u201d does not reasonably\nestablish that she disregarded medical advice in ceasing to take Seroquel five or six years after\nshe was no longer under his care.  Essentially, Department Counsel is asking the Appeal Board to\nagree with a proposition that is not supported by the evidence.

On\nFebruary 22, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn August 9, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department\nCounsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable \ndecision rested on erroneous findings of fact and whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in her 30s, has never been married and has no children.  She has earned\na bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree.  Her parents divorced when she was six years old. \nStarting at about age 10 and periodically continuing in her teens, she received treatment for autism-\nrelated issues.  She was occasionally prescribed antidepressants.  At age 16, she was sexually\nassaulted, filed a police report about four years later, and received mental-health treatment for about\nsix months at some point.  The purported assailant was never charged.  During therapy for the sexual\nassault, she wondered whether her father or someone else sexually assaulted her, but was later\nconfident her father had not sexually assaulted her.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was \u201cdiagnosed with possible Psychosis, possible Bipolar\nDisorder, and possible Borderline or Antisocial Personality Disorder based in part on [her] history\nof high-risk behaviors, including assuming other people\u2019s identities, self-harm, thoughts of harming\nothers, and taking out a $20,000 loan in [her] mother\u2019s name without her permission\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a)\nand that a licensed psychologist \u201cdiagnosed [her] with Other Specified Personality Disorder (mixed\npersonality features) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u201d in December 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).   Decision\nat 2, quoting from SOR.  Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nDr. K\u2019s Evaluation and Treatment\n2\n\nDuring December 2012 and January 2013, Applicant received treatment from Dr. K because\nshe was ashamed about having an 18-month affair with a married coworker.  The affair was against \nthe company\u2019s unofficial rules.  She ended the affair because it was morally wrong and they were\nnot being forthright.  She wanted Dr. K to take her concerns seriously and to help her address the\nunderlying cause of her bad decisions.  She met with Dr. K six time before he retired.  She saw\nanother doctor about once or twice before she stopped seeking counseling.  \nDr.K\u2019s treatment notes indicate that Applicant assumed the identities of other people and\nportrayed different personalities, but did not explain how she manifested these behaviors other than\npatterning others in martial arts.  He did indicate she sometimes adopted mannerisms of friends, but\nshe denied assuming their identities.  She told Dr. K that she was good in martial arts; however, this\nwas an exaggeration because she had no formal training.  She denied ever lying about her name or\nbackground.  \u201cDr. K said she was a \u2018pathological liar\u2019 and \u2018made up stories\u2019 (GE [Government\nExhibit] 4 at 1); however, he did not give an example or provide a basis for these conclusions.\u201d \nDecision at 4.\nDr. K asserted that Applicant forged her mother\u2019s signature on a $20,000 student loan\napplication.  Applicant testified she signed her mother\u2019s name on a $7,000 loan application because\nher mother was out of the country.  She told her mother what she had done upon her return.  Her\nmother corroborated these events.  Applicant has repaid the loan and never intended to deceive her\nmother.\nDr. K said that he was not going to formally diagnose Applicant.  In his intake notes, Dr. K\nindicated his \u201cimpression\u201d was to rule out Bipolar, Borderline, or other personality disorders.   In\naddressing Applicant\u2019s relationship with the married coworker, Dr. K said, \u201cshe had [an] affair to\ngain advantage in workplace\u201d and listed his impression as \u201cPsychosis NOS.\u201d  Decision at 5, quoting\nGE 4 at 9.  In later notes, he repeated the impression of \u201cPsychosis NOS\u201d and eventually added\n\u201cBorderline\u201d personality disorder.  Id., quoting from GE 4 at 11.  Dr. K and another doctor\nprescribed her Seroquel to help with her racing thoughts and to reduce her anxiety.  In about March\n2018, she stopped taking Seroquel. \nDr. B\u2019s Evaluation\nIn December 2018, a psychologist, Dr. B, conducted a [DoD-requested] psychological\nevaluation of Applicant.  Dr. B reviewed Applicant\u2019s medical records and summarized Dr. K\u2019s notes. \nDr. B noted that Applicant\u2019s insight, judgment, and memory seemed poor and many of her\nrecollections seemed vague.  Dr. B attributed Applicant\u2019s guardedness to, among other things, an\nintentional lack of candor.  Applicant denied a history of self-harm, thoughts of self-injury, or\nthoughts of harm to others.  Applicant denied that she was a pathological liar or assumed the\nidentities of others.  Dr. B concluded that Applicant may meet the criteria for a personality disorder\nand that her \u201cbehavioral health history suggests numerous behaviors that cast doubt on her judgment,\nreliability and/or trustworthiness; as such, it may be imprudent to grant her access to classified\n3\n\ninformation.  Based on previous medical opinions and current diagnoses, she presents with\nconditions that could pose a significant risk to national security.\u201d  Decision at 6, quoting from GE\n2 at 8.  \nDr. Y\u2019s Evaluation and Treatment\nBetween December 2018 and July 2019, Applicant had 23 appointments with Dr. Y, a\npsychologist.  She initiated this treatment to help her with relationships.  Dr. Y reviewed and\nassessed Dr. K\u2019s and Dr. B\u2019s reports.  Dr. Y found Applicant to be responsible, candid, and\ndiscerning.  They have weekly cognitive behavioral sessions.  Dr. Y assessed her as a woman who\nis earnestly seeking to improve on a few primitive defense mechanisms that impact her primary\nrelationships.  She is professionally successful and maintains positive working relationships.  For\nnearly seven years, her home life has been stable.  She is dedicated to issues of national security and\nsensitive to information-sharing violations.  She does not display any erratic thoughts or behaviors\nand has maintained a consistent, steady demeanor.  Dr. Y noted that he has not seen any to the\nconcerning behaviors referenced in Dr. K reports.  Dr. Y recommended Applicant for a security\nclearance at the Secret level.     \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe opinions of Dr. K and Dr. B are sufficient to establish security concerns under\nDisqualifying Condition 28(a) -- i.e., behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an\nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent,\nself-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or\nbizarre behaviors -- and Disqualifying Condition 28(b) -- i.e., an opinion by a duly qualified mental\nhealth professional that the individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability,\nreliability, or trustworthiness.  \nThe Judge concluded that Mitigating Condition 29(b) -- i.e., the individual has voluntarily\nentered a counseling or treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the\nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly\nqualified mental health professional -- applied and, in doing so, stated:\nDuring Dr. K\u2019s initial assessment of Applicant when he started his treatment, he\nwrote possible Psychosis, possible Bipolar Disorder, and possible Borderline or\nAntisocial Personality Disorder.  He did not provide a prediction or probability of his\nbelief in the accuracy of these possibilities.  His concluding \u201cimpression\u201d indicated\n\u201cPsychosis NOS\u201d and Borderline Personality Disorder.  This \u201cimpression\u201d is an\nevaluative determination that is short of a diagnosis and is a step towards a diagnosis. \nHe did not tell Applicant that he diagnosed her with Psychosis and/or Borderline\nPersonality Disorder; however, he did prescribe Seroquel, which is often used to treat\nserious mental-health disorders involving Psychosis. Applicant believed Seroquel\n4\n\nwas prescribed to help her with racing thoughts and anxiety. She stopped taking\nSeroquel around March of 2018. There is no evidence she failed to follow treatment\nadvice or failed to take Seroquel against the advice of a mental-health provider. \nDr. B indicated Applicant may have a personality disorder or may have mild  anxiety. \nDr. B focused on Applicant\u2019s behavior and conditions as the basis for a security\nconcern; however, Dr. B\u2019s belief that Applicant has behaviors of security concern\nwas based on Dr. K\u2019s cryptic notes and Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to provide\ncorroboration of Dr. K\u2019s concern.  Applicant acknowledged that she was under\nsignificant stress in December 2012 when she sought Dr. K\u2019s help, and she\nexaggerated her mental-health history to get him to take her concerns seriously. \nAlthough corroboration is not required, and the Government has no burden to \npresent such evidence, it is notable that there was no corroboration from witness \nstatements, hospital admissions, or police reports that Applicant\u2019s behaviors were of\nsecurity concern. \nClearly, the most reliable diagnosis is from Dr. Y, who had 23 sessions with \nApplicant from December 2018 to present.  Treatment is continuing and the\ncondition has not completely resolved.  The magnitude of Dr. Y\u2019s contacts with\nApplicant, and their recency merits more weight than the opinions of Dr. K and Dr.\nB.  Applicant\u2019s character statement from her mother, and performance  evaluations\nprovide further corroboration of Dr. Y\u2019s opinion that Applicant is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to receive access to classified information.  Psychological  conditions\nsecurity concerns are mitigated due to the application of AG \u00b6 29(b).\nDiscussion\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is flawed.  She argues the Judge\u2019s\ndecision rested on erroneous findings of fact, failed to consider or analyze record evidence that\ndetracted from the findings and conclusions, improperly shifted the evidentiary burden to the\nGovernment, and was unsupported by any reasonable reading of the record.  We do not find\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive. \nThere is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of raising and \ndemonstrating factual or legal error by the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0339 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMar. 22, 2001).  Although a Judge is required to examine the relevant evidence and relevant\nadjudicative guidelines, he or she need not discuss each and every piece of record evidence, which\nwould be a practical impossibility (see, e.g.,ISCR Case No. 12-01500 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)\nnor address all of the analytical factors set fourth in the adjudicative guideline (see, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 17-02236 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).  The application of the adjudicative guidelines is not\nreducible to a simple formula, but rather requires the exercise of sound judgment within the\nparameters set by the directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-27371 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 19, 2003).\n5\n\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred in concluding Applicant did not have a\ndiagnosis of a psychological or psychiatric condition.  In this regard, we wrote that Applicant\nadmitted SOR \u00b6 1.b, which stated she was \u201cdiagnosed with Other Specified Personality Disorder\n(mixed personality features) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u201d in December 2018.  While Dr. B\u2019s\nreport specifically states that Applicant \u201chas never been officially diagnosed,\u201d it noted she met the\n\u201cdiagnostic  profile\u201d for those disorders.  GE 2 at 7-8.  Even though the Judge may haved erred in\nfailing to address directly Applicant\u2019s SOR admission that she was \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with those disorders,\nthis was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  As the \u201cConcern\u201d paragraph of Guideline I states,\n\u201c[a] formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline.\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 27.  The Judge correctly found that Dr. K identified his \u201cimpressions\u201d\nof Applicant\u2019s mental-health conditions (Decision at 4-5, citing GE 4) and accurately stated that Dr.\nB indicated Applicant \u201cmay meet the criteria for a personality disorder\u201d (Decision at 6, citing GE\n2 at 7).  The Judge also noted Dr. B stated that Applicant\u2019s \u201cbehavioral health history suggests\nnumerous behaviors that cast doubt on her judgment, reliability and/or trustworthiness; as such, it \nwould be imprudent to grant her access to classified information.\u201d  Decision at 6, quoting GE 2 at\n8.  The Judge\u2019s decision reflects that he made detailed findings and conclusions about the nature and\nscope of Dr. K\u2019s and Dr. B\u2019s concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s mental health.  Based on Dr. K\u2019s notes\nand Dr. B\u2019s report, the Judge correctly concluded that Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(b)\napplied in this case.  Once the Judge concluded the appropriate disqualifying conditions applied, a\nformal diagnosis by a medical professional that Applicant had the identified mental health disorders,\neven if one existed, was not a critical or determinative factor because the burden at that point was\nsquarely on her to mitigate the pertinent security concerns.  In other words, given the scope of Dr.\nK\u2019s notes and Dr. B\u2019s report, we cannot discern how Applicant\u2019s mitigation burden would have\nchanged or increased if either doctor or both had made a formal diagnosis of the identified mental\nhealth disorders.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant was\nnot diagnosed with a psychiatric or psychological disorder fails to establish an analytical deficiency\nthat warrants relief. \nAs a related matter, Department Counsel asserts the Judge erred in failing to conclude that\nDisqualifying Condition 28(d) -- i.e., failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a\ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed medication or failure to\nattend required counseling session -- was applicable. The main point in Department Counsel\u2019s\nassertion is that Applicant failed to take a medication as prescribed.  More specifically, she contends: \nApplicant was prescribed Seroquel in the late 2012, and this medication continued\nto be prescribed by subsequent providers and which she continued to take until\nsometime between 2017 and spring 2018.  Applicant knew that a diagnosis of some\nsort was required in order for the doctor to prescribe  the medication.  Although she\ninsisted at the hearing that she was not aware of what the diagnosis was, Applicant\nalso continued to take Seroquel and seek medication management from 2012 until\n2017 or 2018.  At that point, she ceased taking the medication, although she was not\n6\n\ntold to do so by any mental health professionals at the time.  It defies reason to\nconclude that an individual who, without an opinion of a medical professional, ceases\ntaking psychiatric medication prescribed for a diagnosed condition is not failing to\nfollow a prescribed treatment plan related to an underlying condition.  The Judge\u2019s\nfindings in this regard are therefore reversible. [Appeal Brief at 15.] \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument is based on a faulty premise, i.e., an assumption not supported by\nrecord evidence.  We first note that the SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to follow a\nprescribed treatment plan so as to place this issue directly before the Judge. We also note that\nApplicant was never asked at the hearing if she ceased taking Seroquel in contravention of the\ndirections of medical professionals.  See Tr. at 36\u201338, 42-48 and 59.  Department Counsel\u2019s brief\ncites no record evidence that adequately supports a conclusion that Applicant failed to follow the\ndirections of medical professionals in ceasing the use of that drug.  The fact that Dr. K\u2019s progress\nnotes reflect Applicant should \u201ccontinue current meds\u201d and \u201ccontinue current treatment\u201d does not\nreasonably establish that she disregarded medical advice in ceasing to take Seroquel five or six years\nafter she was no longer under his care.  GE 4 at 8-11.  Essentially, Department Counsel is asking the\nAppeal Board to agree with a proposition that is not supported by the evidence.  We decline to make\nthat leap.  Department counsel has failed to establish the Judge erred by not concluding that\nDisqualifying Condition 28(d) applied.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge improperly shifted the evidentiary burden to the\nGovernment by stating:\nIn this mitigation analysis, the Judge noted that \u201c[a]lthough corroboration is not\nrequired, and the Government has no burden to present such evidence, it is notable\nthat there is no corroboration from witness statements, hospital admissions, or police\nreports that Applicant\u2019s behaviors were of security concern.\u201d  By intimating that\nGovernment failed somehow to meet its burden by not providing affirmative\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s psychological condition, the Judge impermissibly shifted the\nburden back to the Government to prove that Applicant\u2019s psychological conditions\nwere of concern. [Appeal Brief at 24-25, quoting Decision at 10-11.]\nWe do not read the Judge\u2019s language in this case the way Department Counsel does.  Considering\nall the facts and circumstances and reading the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole, Department Counsel\u2019s\ncontention is unpersuasive.  First, the Judge found that disqualifying conditions did apply.  Second,\nthe Judge specifically noted that the Government had no burden to present corroboration.  Finally,\nas a matter of common sense, the Judge may consider the lack of corroboration in determining the\nweight to be given to certain evidence.  See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0419 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30,\n1999).  The Judge\u2019s comment about the lack of corroborating evidence demonstrates no error.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge failed to address relevant facts that detract from\nhis conclusions.  She states, for example, that \u201cApplicant only began being treated by Dr. Y after she\nwas evaluated by the CAF psychologist.\u201d Appeal Brief at 18-19.  This statement is not accurate.  Dr.\n7\n\nY performed a psychiatric evaluation of Applicant on December 1, 2018, and began periodic\nindividual psychotherapy sessions with her seven days later.  Applicant Exhibit (AE) I at 6.  In\ncontrast, Dr. B evaluated Applicant on December 12, 2018.  GE 2 at 1.  We do not find convincing\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument that Applicant\u2019s efforts to seek treatment from Dr. Y is comparable\nto an applicant who takes action to resolve delinquent debts after his or her security clearance is\nplaced in jeopardy due to those debts.  In this regard, we note that Applicant sought treatment from\nDr. Y more than two months before the SOR was issued.  Moreover, nothing restricts an applicant\nfrom obtaining an expert opinion to counter a DoD-requested psychological evaluation.  Department\nCounsel also contends that \u201cDr. Y did not review or comment on the report authored by Dr. B.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 20.  This is not accurate.  Dr. Y\u2019s letters state, \u201cI have read and assessed the reports\nprovided to [Applicant] in relation to her clearance hearing, including those of  Dr. B . . . and  Dr.\nK . . . .\u201d AE at 1 and AE I at 6.\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, Department Counsel contends the \u201cJudge\nall but directed an outcome-oriented opinion from Dr. Y himself, as he instructed Applicant as to\nexactly what would be required in order to rebut the Government evidence.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 20-21.\nIn making this contention, Department Counsel cites to an exchange at the hearing between the\nJudge and Applicant in which he told her to give Dr. Y the notes of Dr. K so that Dr. Y could factor\nthose notes into his assessment.  First, it merits noting that we have previously cautioned Judges to\nrefrain from providing advice to applicants that goes beyond the language of the Directive and, if\napplicable, the current Pre-Hearing Guidance.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 18-00329 at 3 (App. Bd.\nDec. 14, 2018).  That said, we recognize that Judges often point out to pro se applicants matters that\nthey may want to consider presenting as part of a post-hearing submission.  In this case, we find no\nharmful error in the Judge\u2019s comments.  Second, we note that Dr. B was presented with Dr. K\u2019s\nnotes before evaluating Applicant\u2019s mental health status.  Showing Dr. Y the notes of  Dr. K did not\ndirect a particular opinion from him.  Third, to the extent that Department Counsel is contending that\nthe Judge was biased against the Government, we do not find that argument persuasive.  There is a\nrebuttable  presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that\npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03108 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMay 20, 2015).  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments fail to meet the heavy burden on her to rebut the\npresumption of impartiality. \nA key point in Department Counsel\u2019s arguments is that the notes of Dr. K and report of Dr.\nB outweigh the letters of Dr. Y.  A Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve\nsuch conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative reliability,\nplausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2007).  A Judge is neither compelled to accept a DoD-required\npsychologist\u2019s diagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report.  Rather, the\nJudge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding what weight to give conflicting\nexpert opinions.  See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0265 at 4 (Mar. 17, 1999) and ISCR Case No. 99-0288\nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2000).  In this case, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the magnitude and recency\nof Dr. Y\u2019s contacts with Applicant in combination with other corroborating evidence merited more\nweight than the uncorroborated opinions of Dr. K and Dr. B is sustainable.\n8\n\nThe balance of Department Counsel\u2019s arguments are a challenge to the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence and his whole-person assessment.  However, a party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for the different interpretation of the evidence is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun.\n27, 2016).\nDepartment Counsel has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The\nrecord supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 13, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On July 23, 2019, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Robert\nRobinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in a finding of fact\nand whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 12 delinquent debts totaling about $40,700.  In her\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with comments.  She was unemployed\nfrom late 2009 to mid 2012.  Starting in 2016, she provided support for an unspecified period to her\nadult son and his children after he suffered medical problems.  In 2017, she sought the assistance of\na credit counseling service until she became unhappy with their services.  She later retained a law\nfirm that specializes in credit repair.  \u201cAlthough Applicant contends that she and several of her\ncreditors entered into settlement agreements or repayment agreements; or that she has been making\nagreed payments to some creditors; or that she has actually paid off several of the accounts, with one\nexception referring to a $50 payment in February 2019, Applicant failed to submit any documents,\nincluding receipts, cancelled checks, or bank account transactions; to support her contentions that\nany accounts have been settled, paid off, or otherwise resolved; that any agreed settlements have\nactually proceeded to resolution; that any payments have actually been made to any creditors; or that\nthe law firm has taken any action to resolve any of the accounts.\u201d  Decision at 3-4.    \nBecause Applicant has failed to submit sufficient documentation that reflects her delinquent\naccounts have been or are in the process of being resolved, questions and doubts remain as to her\nsecurity clearance eligibility.  She failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial\nproblems.\nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings regarding her educational achievements.  When\na Judge\u2019s findings are challenged, we examine them to see if they are supported by substantial\nevidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n2\n\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-01329 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2018).  In this case, the Judge found \u201cApplicant\ncompleted three years of high school, she did not complete her education, and she did not receive\na diploma.\u201d  Decision at 2.  In her security clearance application (SCA), Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d\nto questions that asked whether she attended any schools in the last 10 years and whether she\nreceived a degree or diploma more than 10 years ago.  File of Relevant Material (FORM) Item 5. \nHer background interview also reflects that she attended high school for three years.  FORM Item\n8.  It appears that Judge reasonably concluded the Applicant did not complete high school based on\nthe information in her SCA and background interview.  On appeal, Applicant states that she received\na high school diploma and lists her other educational achievements that are not reflected in the\nrecord.  Information that was not previously submitted to the Judge for consideration constitutes new\nevidence that the Appeal Board cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  From our review, we\nconclude the Judge\u2019s findings regarding Applicant\u2019s educational achievement are based on\nsubstantial evidence in the record.  \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant explains the reasons for her financial problems and highlights\nthe actions she has taken to resolve them.  She also contends she submitted agreements with various\ncreditors.  Her arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n01717 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2017).  The Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions that Applicant did not\nsubmit sufficient evidence to mitigate the alleged security concerns are sustainable.   As the Board\nhas previously stated, it is reasonable for the Judge to expect applicants to present documentation\nshowing that debts have been resolved or are being resolved.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00893\nat 3 (App. Bd. May 9, 2019).  In this regard, the concept of a \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 [of debt\nresolution] necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On\nMarch 6, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On August 8, 2019,\nafter considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nRobert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\ncharacterization of the evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency\nfrom about 1979 to 1981 while granted access to classified information and that he used it in about\nDecember 2017 while granted access to classified information.   Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged\nthat Applicant falsified a security clearance application in 2010 for failing to disclose that he ever\nillegally used a controlled substance while possessing a security clearance, and the SOR also cross-\nalleged the Guideline H allegation that Applicant used marijuana in about December 2017 while\ngranted access to classified information.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the\nSOR allegations. The Judge found against Applicant on all of the allegations.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that were not previously\nsubmitted to the Judge for consideration.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in his characterization of the evidence.  In the Decision,\nthe Judge concluded:\nApplicant admittedly was a recreational substance abuser between June 1979 and\nJune 1981.  Although he did not use marijuana for nearly four decades thereafter, in\nDecember 2017, he once again succumbed to smoking marijuana as part of what he\ndescribed as a \u201cceremonial partaking.\u201d   [Decision at 6.]\nApplicant argues that the Judge implied a pattern of behavior that did not exist and his use of word\n\u201csuccumbed\u201d incorrectly reflects that Applicant had some underlying urge to use marijuana.  From\nour review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security\nconcern are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014).   \nApplicant also contends the Judge erred in his mitigation and whole-person analysis.  For\nexample, he points out that he ceased using marijuana for decades and only used it more recently at\na solemn moment, a funeral.  These arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence and are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\n2\n\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd.\nNov. 22, 2017).  Applicant asserts that the Judge should have engaged in an more extensive whole-\nperson inquiry.  The Directive, however, does not authorize a Judge to act as an investigator for\neither party.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-06659 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2012).  Having admitted the\nSOR allegations, Applicant was responsible for presenting evidence to mitigate the resulting security\nconcerns, and he had the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a security clearance.

We also note that Applicant has not challenged on appeal the Judge unfavorable\nfalsification finding, which is an independent basis for the Judge\u2019s adverse decision.  \nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

She experienced periods of unemployment.

On\nMarch 18, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 25, 2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred regarding the extent\nof Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is employed by a Defense Contractor.  He has held a security clearance since 2006. \nHe used marijuana about two to five times a year from 2000 until 2018, including during those years\nin which he had access to classified information.  He acknowledged that having done so was a poor\ndecision and that such conduct was illegal under Federal law as well as state law during most of his \nperiod of use.  When interviewed after submitting his security clearance application (SCA),\nApplicant stated that he intended to use marijuana in the future.  Subsequently he signed a document\nretracting this statement and promising not to use illegal drugs in the future.  Applicant\u2019s employer\nhas a drug-free workplace policy, and he has attended briefings about what steps to take if a\nsubordinate is believed to be using drugs on the job.\nAlthough Applicant has not used marijuana for over a year, the Judge cited to what he termed\nconsistent ingestion of marijuana over several years.  The Judge noted that use of marijuana was\nillegal and that Applicant did so while holding a clearance and in contravention of his employer\u2019s\ndrug-free workplace policy.  The Judge stated that there is little evidence to suggest that Applicant\nwill not return to drug use in the future, characterizing his statements to the contrary as self-serving. \nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal includes matters not contained in the record, including an attachment that\npost-dates the Judge\u2019s decision.  We are not permitted to consider new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant argues that the Judge overstated the extent of his marijuana use.  He\ncites to his testimony and his SOR Answer that he had used the drug only about once a year on\naverage rather than two to five times, as the Judge found.  However, the challenged finding is based\non Applicant\u2019s disclosures contained in his 2016 SCA and in his clearance interview.  After\nconsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the finding is based upon \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Even if the Judge had found that\nApplicant had used marijuana an average of once a year, it is not likely that he would have arrived\n2\n\nat a different overall decision.  Therefore, even if he erred, such error was harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No.18-02302 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2019). \nApplicant contends that his marijuana use was legal in his state of residence and that he did\nnot understand the conflict with Federal law and the implications of drug misuse on one\u2019s eligibility\nfor a clearance.  In the first place, it has long been established that ignorance or mistake of law is\ngenerally not an excuse for failing to abide by legal obligations.  See, e.g., Rhode Island v.\nMassachusetts, 45 U.S. 591, 613 (1846).  In any event, we are not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s claim\nof ignorance.  He testified that after completing an SCA in 2006 he was aware of the Federal\nGovernment\u2019s position on drug use by clearance holders.  Tr. at 26-27.  An applicant\u2019s use of illegal\ndrugs after having completed a security clearance application or after otherwise having been placed\non notice of the incompatibility of drug abuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his or\nher judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).  We resolve this assignment of error\nadversely to Applicant.\nApplicant cites to various pieces of record evidence that he believes support his effort to\nobtain a favorable decision.  Among other things, he notes his good work performance, his having\nvoluntarily disclosed his security-significant conduct, what he asserted was the relative infrequency\nof his marijuana use, and his efforts to relieve stress through legally permissible means.  These were\nthings that the Judge was bound to consider, along with all of the other evidence in the record. \nApplicant also states that he has held a clearance for many years with \u201czero security related issues.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 2.  However, while there is no evidence that he has committed any security\ninfractions, Applicant\u2019s drug use over several years while holding a clearance fairly qualifies as a\nsecurity concern, as the Judge stated in his analysis.  Applicant\u2019s arguments in their entirety are not\nenough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence, nor are they enough\nto demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01482 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019).  Despite\nApplicant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies\nwith the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3, in that he considered the totality of the evidence in reaching\nhis decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03592 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 14, 2017).     \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On September 26,\n2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative\nJudge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana on various occasions\nfrom about 2011 to early 2017, including while granted access to classified information, that he\npurchased marijuana on various occasions from about 2012 to mid-2015; that he used cocaine on\nat least two occasions from about 2015 to early 2017, including while granted access to classified\ninformation; and that he used a prescription medication that was not prescribed to him on at least one\noccasion in about late 2016.  Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his\nresponses to three illegal drug activity questions in a security clearance application in 2016.  In\nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each allegation.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant\non one falsification allegation and against him on the remaining allegations.  \nIn the appeal brief, Applicant states that he agrees with the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. \nHowever, he contends that the Judge erred in his mitigation and whole-person analysis.  In his\narguments, he asserts, for example, that he has stopped all use of illegal drugs; that he has matured\nas an individual, and that he has severed his relationships with drug users.  These arguments amount\nto a challenge of the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are insufficient to establish that he\nweighed it in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).  Of particular note, Applicant has not directly challenged\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse falsification findings.  \nApplicant also contends that, if he was provided a renewed opportunity, he would present \na certified pledge to refrain from illegal drugs, character references, and other evidence.  The Appeal\nBoard is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-10934 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents (most of which postdate the Decision) and\nassertions that were not previously submitted to the Judge for consideration.  The Appeal Board is\nprohibited from considering new evidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIn his brief, Applicant contends that, due to time constraints, he was unable to fully address\nthe alleged security concerns.  He asserts that he \u201cfaithfully engaged in discovery\u201d until time was\nexhausted for submitting matters and that he \u201cwas not clear on how to prepare my SOR, nor was [he]\naware how important it was to be present at the hearing and, in fact, that is the crux of [his] appeal.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1-2.  Applicant did not make any of these assertions in responding to the SOR.  The\ndocuments accompanying the SOR appropriately advised Applicant of his right either to request a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge or, if he wished, to have the Administrative Judge issue a\ndecision based upon the administrative record without a hearing.  As noted above, Applicant elected\nto have the Judge issue his decision based upon the administrative record.  See Items 1 and 2 of\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM). \nIt also merits noting that Applicant was forwarded the FORM on June 24, 2019.   He received\nit on July 1, 2019, and was given 30 days from its receipt to file objections or submit additional\nmatters.  He did not submit a response to the FORM.  Applicant has failed either to allege or\nestablish that the Judge abused her discretion in the processing of this case.  From our review of the\nrecord, Applicant was provided the due process rights afforded him under the Directive.  \nApplicant further notes the Judge\u2019s adverse decision has had a negative impact on him.  The\nDirective, however, does not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 14-04202 at 4 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nRichard L. Morris, Esq.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nFebruary 20, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions), Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 18,\n2019, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nLeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that\nApplicant was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings on the Guideline G and\n\nGuideline E allegations have not been raised as an issue on appeal.  Consistent with the following,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in his late 30s, has been an employee of a defense contractor since 2006. \nHe is divorced, has a minor child, and lives with a fiancee who has two minor children.  He has held\na security clearance since 2009.\nDuring a month period in 2001, Applicant\u2019s conduct resulted in four separate fires.  The first\nincident occurred when he was heavily intoxicated.  While walking to his apartment,  he flicked a\nlighted cigarette into the bed of a parked pickup truck. This started a fire that spread and destroyed\nthe truck and four residences.   In another incident, he poured hair spray into a beer can and ignited\nit.  A fire started in a hallway after he stumbled.  The fire department was summoned to extinguish\nthe hallway fire.  As a result of these fires, felony and misdemeanor charges were brought against\nApplicant.\nShortly after those incidents, Applicant\u2019s father arranged for him to be evaluated by a military\npsychologist.  Applicant told the psychologist that he had been diagnosed with attention deficient\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder for which he was prescribed medications and\nthat he stopped taking the bipolar disorder medication because he could not drink alcohol while on\nit.  He also told the psychologist that he had difficulty controlling his anger because of the bipolar\ndisorder.  The psychologist did not believe Applicant was forthcoming during the interview and\nappeared to be seeking help to present himself in a positive light in court.  The psychologist\ndiagnosed him with alcohol abuse, but not bipolar disorder.  At the security clearance hearing,\nApplicant testified that he was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder but assumed he had that\ncondition because he was prescribed medication for it while in college.\nFollowing the psychological evaluation, Applicant completed an alcohol awareness program\nand treatment. In 2002, Applicant pled guilty to two felony and four misdemeanor counts.  The two\nother felony counts were dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement.  In October 2002, he was sentenced\nto 12-24 months in jail.  He was released from jail in October 2003.\nIn about 2011 or 2012, Applicant sought psychotherapy after learning his then-wife was\npregnant by her ex-husband.  He experienced panic attacks and was prescribed anti-anxiety\nmedication.  Apparently because this treatment related to marital problems, he did not disclose it on\nhis 2014 security clearance application (SCA).  In 2014, he completed a 12-week psycho-educational\nprogram in anger management after he was involved in an altercation at work that resulted in him\nbeing convicted of assault and battery.\nIn early 2018, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist at DoD\u2019s request.\nRegarding this evaluation, the Judge stated:\nThe psychologist commented that Applicant was not truthful and forthcoming during\nthe evaluation.  She noted that he denied ever having symptoms of ADHD, and that \nhe did not disclose his treatment for anxiety in his SCA.  She administered a\n3\n\npersonality assessment inventory but found that the results were not interpretable\nbecause the validity scales indicated that he was presenting himself in an\nunrealistically favorable light.  She reported that Applicant admitted starting only one\nfire and claimed that he was present at the other fires but did not start them.  She\nreviewed his medical records, which reflected that a psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant\nwith bipolar disorder in 2000.  She also commented that Applicant\u2019s medical records\nreflect that he frequently admitted that he was diagnosed as bipolar.  She stated her\nability to make a definitive diagnosis was limited, because Applicant appeared to\nhave withheld information about his mental health history.  She concluded that\nApplicant \u201chas mental, emotional, or personality conditions that could impair\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d  Her diagnosis was (1) alcohol use disorder,\nremission status unknown; (2) bipolar disorder, most recent episode depressed; and\n(3) anxiety disorder, unspecified. (GX [Government Exhibit] 4). [Decision at 4.]\nBetween 2017 and 2019, Applicant received psychotherapy from three medical professionals.\nThe first therapist saw Applicant 15 times and diagnosed him with generalized anxiety disorder,\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSP), and adjustment disorder with anxiety.  The second therapist\nsaw Applicant six times and diagnosed him with generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, and major\ndepressive disorder, recurrent and moderate.  His PTSD is attributed to trauma during his prior\nmarriage and contentious divorce.  He is now considered emotionally stable but occasionally is\naffected by stress and depression, mostly from co-parenting conflicts with his ex-wife.  The second\ntherapist continues to treat Applicant and noted he has no indication of an alcohol-abuse disorder\nand is not bipolar.  In late 2018, the third therapist diagnosed him with adjustment disorder with\nmixed disturbance of emotions and conduct that has improved from two previous evaluations.\n  Company owners (which includes Applicant\u2019s father), coworkers, and friends attest to\nApplicant\u2019s honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness.  His father stated that Applicant was never\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder or alcohol dependence.  Applicant testified that he takes anti-anxiety\nmedication daily and has learned to deal with stressful situations. \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Analysis\nThe evidence established disqualifying conditions in Directive Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 28(b), an\nopinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition that may\nimpair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, and \u00b6 28(d), failure to follow a prescribed\ntreatment plan related to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment,\nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed\nmedication or failure to attend required counseling sessions.  The therapists\u2019 testimony and\ndocumentary evidence also established mitigating conditions in \u00b6 29(a), the identified condition is\nreadily controllable with treatment and the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent\ncompliance with the treatment plan, and \u00b6 29(b), the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling\nor treatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently\nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a qualified mental health\nprofessional.  The favorable evidence from the therapists, however, does not overcome the \nunfavorable diagnosis in the DoD-requested psychological\u2019s evaluation.  Moreover,  \u201cApplicant\u2019s\nlack of candor with the U.S. Government psychologist raises a question whether he has been candid\n4\n\nwith his own therapists.\u201d  Decision at 10.  Additionally, any doubt about the probability of recurrence\nmust be resolved in favor of national security.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that he was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder.   In his arguments, he emphasizes his testimony as well as his therapist\u2019s testimony that he\nwas not diagnosed with that condition.  He argues the DoD-requested psychologist\u2019s evaluation is\nnot a medical diagnosis but was a document review and relied on an alcohol-treatment intake sheet\nat  which time he mistakenly reported he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a child.  Applicant\nrealized years later that he was not diagnosed with that condition.  He further argues that his therapist\nand other witnesses testified that he does not display the symptoms of bipolar disorder.  \nA Judge is tasked to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014).  In the Decision, the Judge made findings of fact and\nconclusions that addressed the conflicts in the evidence as to whether Applicant was diagnosed with\nbipolar disorder.  We find no reason to disturb those findings or conclusions.  As the Judge found,\nGX 4 reflects the DoD-requested psychologist diagnosed Applicant, in part, with \u201cBipolar Disorder,\nmost recent episode depressed.\u201d  This diagnosis was based on a records review, clinical interview,\nand Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).  The psychologist\u2019s report reflects Applicant told her\nthat he was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder in prison when he was admitted to a hospital for a\nweek for stabilization and was prescribed Depakote; furthermore, she also notes Applicant\u2019s\npsychological evaluation before the criminal proceeding during which he reported being previously\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder and being prescribed the same medication that he discontinued\ntaking so he could continue consuming alcohol.  GX 4 at 3.  The psychologist\u2019s report further states,\n\u201cA review of medical records from Dr. G . . . , the psychiatrist who diagnosed him with Bipolar\nDisorder,\u201d noted the Applicant, as a high school senior, received court-ordered counseling and spent\ntime in a detention home after the police found him making bombs.  Id.  From our review of the\nrecord, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions that Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inference that could be drawn\nfrom the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).\nApplicant\u2019s brief also notes that he has voluntarily sought treatment for his mental health\nissues and has positively embraced his treatment plan.  He argues recurrence of any condition is\nextremely low and, based on a whole-person analysis, he should be granted a security clearance. \nThese arguments amount to a challenge of the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are insufficient\nto show the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).   \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. \nOn November 14, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  Although \nthe SOR was styled originally as an ADP case, the Judge determined this was an ISCR case because\nApplicant was being sponsored for a security clearance.1  On February 26, 2020, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in her 40s, previously held a security clearance that was revoked by another\nFederal agency in 2013.  The SOR alleged that Applicant committed employee theft in about 1989;\nthat she stole computer equipment from two different employers from 2000 to 2007; and that she\nillegally downloaded movies from 1993 to 2008, music from 2008 to 2011, and computer software. \nShe denied the allegations that she stole computer equipment from the two employers and admitted\nthe other allegations.  During a 2012 security investigation, which involved an interview and\npolygraph examination, Applicant admitted engaging in the alleged conduct.  \nWhile the passage of time partially mitigated Applicant\u2019s earliest misconduct, \u201cwhat is most\ntroubling about Applicant\u2019s behavior is that she possesses an extensive IT [information technology]\nbackground, yet her inappropriate conduct fell directly into her area of expertise, i.e., theft of, or\nunauthorized use of computer hardware and software.  Applicant failed to provide sufficient\nevidence to mitigate the personal conduct, criminal conduct, and use of information technology\nsecurity concerns.\u201d  Decision at 8.   \nDiscussion\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant essentially contends she did not steal computer equipment from \nthe two employers.  She claims that, when she arrived a her position, \u201cemployees were already\npermitted to take excess equipment that was not being used and music downloads were being done \nas well.  . . .  Excessed or DMRO [Defense Material Reutilization Office] equipment was permitted\nto be taken by the staff as well to the point that asking permission was not even required from\nmanagement . . . .\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1-2.  In the decision, the Judge addressed this claim by stating:\n1  At the beginning of the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that she was hoping to have her security clearance\nreinstated.  Tr. at 9.\n2\n\nAlso during the March 2012 interview, Applicant admitted that while\nworking for two different employers (one was a successor contractor to the other)\nfrom 2000 to 2007 she took, without permission or authorization, numerous\ncomputer items, including multiple computer towers, monitors, keyboards, mouse\nsets, speakers, and memory sticks.  She also took at least three laptop computers. \nShe used these herself at home and gave several away to family members, her\nfriends, and even her church.  The value of the items was in excess of several\nthousands of dollars.  She explained to the interviewer that she took the items\nbecause she could not afford to buy similar items at the time and the company was\noverstocked with these surplus items.  She was told by a government employee that \nthe items were to be strictly accounted for, but he also insinuated that he did not care\nif she took things.  She knew what she was doing was wrong and she stopped.  In her\nSOR answer and during her testimony, Applicant backed away from total acceptance\nof responsibility for her actions and claimed she had verbal authority from a\nsupervisor to take the items.  She also claimed that there was a culture of\npermissiveness when it comes to computer accountability at these companies during\nher time.  Her SOR responses on this issue and her testimony were not credible.\n[Decision at 3.]  \n  \nAs provided in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, the Appeal Board gives deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility\ndetermination.  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions\nregarding the theft of the computer equipment are based on substantial evidence or constitute\nreasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225\nat 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nApplicant also contends that she is a different person than the one depicted in the exhibits,\nthat she has participated in community service, and that she demonstrated her reliability in  jobs for\nthe last seven years.  Her arguments are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the\nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017).   \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nMarch 12, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline G\n(Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On June 26, 2019, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  On September\n6, 2019, the Appeal Board remanded the decision to the Judge for corrective action.  On October 10,\n2019, the Judge issued a Decision on Remand in which he again denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance, and Applicant appealed that decision. \nIn the Decision on Remand, the Judge found in favor of Applicant on two of six Guideline\nF allegations and on all of the Guideline G allegations.  Those favorable findings have not been\nraised as an issue in this appeal.  The Judge found against Applicant on SOR allegations asserting\nthat he received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2017; that he failed to file local state taxes for\n2014-2016 as required; that he owed about $740 in local state taxes for 2013; and that he owed about\n$1,700 in Federal income taxes for 2013-2016.   \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant questions whether the Judge had access to his Enhanced\nSubject Interview (ESI).  He argues that document shows that his financial problems were due to\nconditions largely beyond his control and the Judge made no mention of it in his findings.  The ESI\nis included in Item 6 of Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).  In his analysis,\nthe Judge did discuss that Applicant experienced several conditions beyond his control, such as a\nmarital breakup, unemployment, back injury, uninsured medical expenses, and a Government\nfurlough, but concluded he did not act responsibly under the circumstances.  Applicant\u2019s arguments\npertaining to the ESI are not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all the\nevidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05959 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016).   \nApplicant contends the Judge stated in the decision that he did not provide evidence to\nsupport his claim that his Federal income taxes were paid.  He challenges that purported statement\nby pointing to a bank statement he provided on remand showing he received an IRS refund in May\n2019 and arguing that he would not have received that refund if he still owed past-due Federal taxes. \nIn our prior decision, we remanded the case to the Judge \u201cto reopen the record to provide the parties\nan opportunity to present evidence and address the apparent conflict in the tax transcripts about the\ntax return filing dates . . . .\u201d   \nIn the Decision on Remand, the Judge stated:\nThe Appeal Board decision noted that Applicant claimed in his appeal brief that he\npaid the federal tax debt before I issued my original decision, but that he submitted\nno evidence to support his claim.  He repeated his claim in his submission on\nremand.  My original decision was based on the evidence in the record as of the date\nthe record closed.  If Applicant subsequently paid his delinquent taxes, he may\n2\n\nrequest reconsideration [sic] in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.37 through E3.1.39.\n[Decision on Remand at 7.]\nSince we only instructed the Judge to reopen the record on remand for the purpose of providing the\nparties the opportunity to submit evidence on the tax filing issue, we cannot conclude it was error\nfor the Judge to decline to consider evidence that Applicant submitted on remand regarding other\nissues, such as the Federal tax debt.   \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant did not receive financial counseling.  In his appeal brief,\nApplicant challenges that conclusion by stating that he thought he submitted such proof but could\nnot positively say he did so and would like to submit such proof.  The Appeal Board, however,\ncannot receive new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.   We note that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy\npetition filed in early 2017 reflects that he received a briefing from an approved credit counseling\nagency within 180 days before the filing of that petition and he obtained a certificate of completion. \nFORM Item 8 at 9 and Item 6 at 17.  Even though the Judge may have erred by failing to give\nApplicant credit for receiving financial counseling, such an error was harmless because it did not\nlikely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.17-01181 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30,\n2018).  Applicant also contends that a security clearance is very important to him.  However, the\nadverse impact of an unfavorable decision is not relevant in evaluating clearance eligibility.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 11-13180 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 21, 2013).  \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge examined\nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is\nsustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b):  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel\nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d\n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan              \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.
