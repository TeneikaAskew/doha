Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn December 28, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. On July 23,\n2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nDecember 23, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nraise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n2\nGuideline H (drug involvement).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on September 9, 2008, and I convened a hearing on October 21, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4).\nApplicant testified and submitted two exhibits (Ax. A and B). I also left the record open\nafter the hearing to receive additional relevant information. On October 29, 2008, I\nreceived a post-hearing submission, which is included in the record without objection as\nAx. C. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on November 5, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant used marijuana from age 17\nuntil he graduated college in 1984 at age 25 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he previously submitted a\nsecurity clearance application in October 2001, thus becoming aware that illegal drug\nuse may raise a concern about his suitability to hold a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.b);\nand that Applicant again used marijuana, about 30 times, between May 2006 and May\n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nApplicant admitted with explanation all of the SOR allegations. As to SOR \u00b6 1.b,\nthe facts alleged are relevant to this decision; however, they are not potentially\ndisqualifying in and of themselves. Rather, this allegation merely pleads evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s awareness of the security significance of his involvement with illegal drugs, a\nfact I have considered in reaching my decision. SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for the\nApplicant. I have also made the following additional findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 49 years old. He graduated from college in 1984 with a degree in\nelectrical engineering. Since at least August 2000, he has been employed in the\ninformation technology (IT) sector. Since December 2007, he has worked for a defense\ncontractor as a senior engineer. He requires a security clearance for his current job, but\nhad submitted applications for a security clearance (SF 86) in October 2001, and for a\npublic trust position (SF 85P) in March 2006. Each of Applicant\u2019s applications for\nclearance or positions of trust required Applicant to disclose any involvement with illegal\ndrugs in the preceding seven years. (Gx. 1; Gx. 3; Gx. 4; Tr. 22 - 23)\nApplicant first used marijuana at age 17 and continued to use it until he\ncompleted his undergraduate studies in 1984. Applicant flunked out of the first college\nhe attended because he was \u201cpartying too much.\u201d He continued his studies at a\ncommunity college before transferring to the college where he obtained his engineering\ndegree. Between 1984 and May 2006, Applicant was not involved with illegal drugs. (Tr.\n30 - 31; Gx. 2)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n3\nApplicant is an avid musician and works with local students through recording\nsessions at a studio in his house. On one evening in May 2006, Applicant and a friend\nwent to another person\u2019s house to rehearse. At some point, that person produced some\nmarijuana and all three smoked it in a pipe. Before leaving that evening, Applicant\npurchased about 1/4 ounce of marijuana for his own use. He smoked it by himself at\nhome over the next year at a rate of about twice monthly. (Tr. 32 - 35) At the time he\nresumed his marijuana use, Applicant was working as a database administrator for a\ncompany that supported a government agency. (Gx. 1; Gx. 4; Tr. 31, 49)\nApplicant has been married since January 1988. His wife has used marijuana but\nnot in the past 25 years. She was aware, but did not approve of Applicant\u2019s drug use.\n(Tr. 47 - 48) Applicant stopped using marijuana in May 2007, in part, after his brother\ndied unexpectedly. Applicant claimed that event caused him to re-evaluate his life and\nhis priorities. He also is interested in living a healthier lifestyle. (Tr. 50 - 51; Gx. 2)\nApplicant still sees occasionally one of the people with whom he used marijuana\nin 2006. He also socializes with a neighbor whom he knows uses marijuana. Applicant\nasserted that he has made clear to both that he cannot be involved in any way with\nillegal drugs. (Tr. 37 - 38, 52)\nIn October 2008, Applicant completed six months of weekly drug counseling\nsessions, which included periodic urine tests for marijuana and cocaine. Applicant has\nrepeatedly stated he would submit to drug testing at anytime, and he has submitted a\nwritten statement of intent asserting he will not use illegal drugs in the future. (Answer to\nSOR; Ax. B; Ax. C; Tr. 28)\nApplicant has a good reputation at work. (Ax. A) He is also active in the\ncommunity through his musical work with local youth, and through free dog training\nservices he offers. (Tr. 38)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,3\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n4\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 24 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n5\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.6\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the SOR\nallegations. The facts established by the government\u2019s information and the Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions raise a security concern addressed in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n5\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and\nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nApplicant used marijuana while in college, but stopped 24 years ago. Had he not\nresumed using marijuana in 2006, his past drug use would be of little or no security\nconcern. Further, his recent use was not a one time lapse in judgment that might be\nwritten off as reliving old times with old friends. Applicant bought marijuana, which he\nillegally possessed and used over the course of the next 12 months. Because he had\npreviously completed two government applications for positions of trust, it cannot\nreasonably be disputed that he knew such conduct could cause the government to\nquestion his suitability for access to classified information. Yet, he resumed using\nmarijuana about two months after he submitted his SF 85P, and continued using\nthrough most of his tenure with the federal contractor where he worked immediately\nbefore his current employer hired him. These facts require application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse (see definition [at AG \u00b6\n25(a)]) and AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia).\nIn response, Applicant\u2019s information shows he has not used illegal drugs since\nMay 2007, that he completed a program of counseling and drug testing between April\nand October 2008, and that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. Further,\nalthough he still occasionally sees a friend with whom he used marijuana and who still\nuses marijuana, Applicant has made clear that he will not tolerate any drug use in his\npresence. These facts require application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 26(b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) dissociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts...(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation). Additionally, while the counseling program he\ncompleted was not prescribed by a medical professional, he is entitled to some limited\nconsideration under the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 26(d) (satisfactory completion of a\nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and\naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional). \nOf the remaining Guideline H mitigating conditions with potential application to\nthese facts, I have specifically declined to apply the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 26(a)\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). His conduct must be considered\nrecent despite his current record of abstention from drug use. It is too soon to conclude\nhe will not use drugs in the future because of his resumption of drug use two years ago\n\n See footnote 3, supra.\n7\n See footnote 6, supra. \n8\n6\nafter a 24 year hiatus. For the same reason, Applicant may not benefit from AG \u00b6 26(b)\n(a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:...(3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence). On balance, I am not persuaded that Applicant\u2019s\nillegal drug use is behind him. Applicant resumed frequent drug use after a long period\nof abstinence, and he did so knowing that such conduct is illegal and directly at odds\nwith government policies about drug use. Notwithstanding the positive information about\nApplicant\u2019s conduct since May 2007, he has failed to mitigate the security concerns\nestablished through the government\u2019s information. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline H. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 49 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. Since he graduated college in 1984, it appears he has\nlived a stable and responsible lifestyle. He has been married for 20 years and, at least\nsince 2000, has been steadily employed in the IT industry. He stays active in the\ncommunity and there do not appear to be any concerns about his honesty or his job\nperformance. However, his decision to resume regular drug use severely undermines\nthe value of this positive information. It is recent, serious, and repeated conduct, and he\nengaged in that behavior knowing that it was wrong. All of the information regarding\nApplicant\u2019s recent drug use make it more likely than not that such conduct will recur.\nThe facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s drug use present an unacceptable\nrisk to the national interest were he to be given access to classified information. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all available information shows there are still doubts\n7\nabout his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests as his own.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security \nconcerns for financial considerations under Guideline F, and personal conduct under \nGuideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 14, 2008.  He admitted seven and \ndenied seven of the allegations under Guideline F and denied the allegations under \nGuideline E.  He provided an explanation for his admissions and denials, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on August 22, 2008, and the case was assigned me on August 25, 2008.  \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 2, 2008, scheduling a hearing on \nOctober 7, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered four \nexhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant submitted 17 documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. \nEx.) A-Q, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  The \nrecord was left open for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted five additional documents marked App. Ex. R-V.  The government did not \nobject to the admission of the documents (See Gov. Ex. 5, Department Counsel Letter, \ndated October 20, 2008), and the documents are admitted into the record.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 15, 2008.  Based upon a review \nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and has been an electronics security technician for a \ndefense contractor for about three years.  He enlisted in the Army at age 19 and served \nfor over nine years reaching the grade of sergeant (E-5).  He was discharged in July \n2003 with an honorable discharge.  He later enlisted in the Air Force Reserves where \nhe still serves as a sergeant (E-5).  Upon discharge, he started working for the defense \ncontractor (Tr. 54-58; Gov.

She left their home and \nApplicant does not know where she is located (Tr. 62-63).  Applicant's monthly net pay \nis $3,600, with monthly expenses of $2,900, leaving $700 monthly in discretionary or \ndisposable funds.  He also receives about $200 per month in Reserve pay (Tr. 112-\n117). \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application in May 2005 while working \nfor the defense contractor.  Applicant received a blank SF 86 which he completed with \nthe required information.  He left employment with the defense contractor shortly \nthereafter for a company that did not require a security clearance.  The defense \ncontractor stopped the processing of the application for security clearance.  About six \nmonths later in November 2005, Applicant returned to work for the defense contractor \nand the process of requesting a security clearance started again.  The defense \ncontractor security staff used the information provided by Applicant on the May 2005 SF \n86 to complete a new e-QIP security clearance application dated December 23, 2005.  \nAt the request of the security staff, Applicant updated his employment and residence \ninformation.  Applicant signed new signature pages on January 19, 2006.  Applicant did \nnot see or review the data on the application itself (Tr. 56-61; Gov. Ex 1, Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP), dated February 14, 2006; App. Ex. \nN. Company Memorandum, dated August 12, 2008; App. Ex. P, Adjudication History, \ndated August 12, 2008).   \n \nThe security clearance application has a negative response to question 27d \nwhich asked in the last seven years did he have any judgments unpaid.  In response to \nquestion 28a asking if Applicant had any debts in the last seven years over 180 days \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndelinquent, one debt was listed.  There was a negative response to question 28b asking \nif he presently had any debts over 90 days delinquent.  Applicant presented his credit \nreport from February 18, 2004.  The report lists his debts as \"pay as agreed\" with no \npast due debts.  His student loans are listed as deferred.  The account listed on the \nsecurity clearance application that was more than 180 days past due is listed on the \ncredit report as a collection account that was paid with a zero balance (App. Ex. P, \nCredit Report, dated February 18, 2004). \n \nApplicant's supervisor notes that Applicant has a strong work ethic and is \ndedicated to his country and job.  The supervisor acknowledged that Applicant's security \nclearance application was based on the one he initially submitted before leaving the \ncompany.  When he returned and the application was resubmitted, it was not updated \nby the company.  This was an oversight on the part of the company and the error was \nnot noted until the application had been submitted.  In his opinion, Applicant has \nhandled the issues to the best of his ability (App Ex. Q, Letter, undated). \n \nCredit reports show that Applicant has the following delinquent debts; a judgment \nfor rent of $407 (SOR 1.a); another judgment of $2,502 for rent to the same landlord \n(SOR 1.b); a judgment on a pay day loan of $582 (SOR 1.c); a credit card account in \ncollection for $2,390 (SOR 1.d); a credit card in collection for $1,998 (SOR 1.e); a bank \nservice fee on an account in collection for $512 (SOR 1.f); a charged off jewelry store \naccount for $599 (SOR 1.g); a credit card in collection for $6,780 (SOR 1.h); an account \nin collection for $475 (SOR 1.i); student loans in collection for $34,765 (SOR 1.j); a loan \nin collection for $4,887 (SOR 1.k); a telephone account in collection for $984 (SOR 1.l); \nand two bank accounts to the same bank in collection for $368 and $192 (SOR 1.m and \n1.n) (See Gov.

Ex. 4, Credit Report, dated February 1, 2006).  \nApplicant admitted delinquent debts alleged in SOR 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g. 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l.  \nApplicant denied delinquent debts alleged in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c stating that they \nwere paid.  He denied delinquent debt SOR 1.k since it is a duplicate of the delinquent \ndebt listed in SOR 1.h.  He denied delinquent debts SOR 1.m and 1.n since they are the \nsame debts that are noted in delinquent debt SOR 1.f (See Response to SOR, dated \nJuly 14, 2008). \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.a and 1.b are for judgments granted for back rent on \nApplicant's apartment.  When he left the Army and began working for the defense \ncontractor, Applicant had difficulty meeting his financial obligations.  His wife did not \nwork so there was only one income.  He did not pay his rent on time so his landlord \nentered judgments against him for past due rent in May, October, and December 2005.  \nThe judgments were dropped when Applicant paid the rent satisfying the debts (Tr. 22-\n25, App. Ex. B, Notice of Satisfaction, dated February 2006; App. Ex. C, Notice of \nSatisfaction, dated June 9, 2006).  Applicant also satisfied a judgment entered against \nhim by a pay day loan company (Tr.20-22; App. Ex. A, Notice of Satisfaction, dated \nDecember 21, 2004). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant initially consulted a credit counselor at the bankruptcy court.  Upon the \nadvice of the credit counselor, he consulted an attorney but subsequently could not \nafford to hire the attorney to file the bankruptcy action for him (Tr. 45-46, App. Ex. K, \nCounseling certificate, dated February 27, 2006, App. Ex. M, Attorney letter, dated April \n21, 2006). Applicant again sought counseling for bankruptcy from the court in August \n2008, and an action plan was discussed (Tr. 46-47; App. Ex. L (Counseling certificate, \ndated August 4, 2008).  This time Applicant was able to hire the attorney and a petition \nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy was filed (Tr. 87-88, 105-110; App. Ex. J, Attorney Letter, \ndated October 6, 2008; App. Ex. R, Attorney letter, dated October 17, 2008; App. Ex. S, \nPayment to Attorney, dated October 16, 2008).  Included in the list of creditors for the \nChapter 13 bankruptcy are the bank loan for $2,390 (Tr. 25-26; SOR 1.d), another bank \nloan in collection for $1,998 (Tr. 26; SOR 1.e), the jewelry store debt for $599 (Tr. 32; \nSOR 1.g), a furniture loan for $6,780 (Tr. 32-33, SOR 1.h (this is the same debt as \nnoted in SOR 1.k, See App. Ex. E, Letter of transfer, dated December 16, 2006)), and \nthe telephone debt (Tr. 41-42, 91-92; SOR 1.l).  \n \nApplicant settled for $385.15 the $512 collection account for a bank (SOR 1.f).  \nThis debt is an accumulation of the debts listed at SOR 1.m and 1.n (Tr. 25-32, 82-86, \nApp. Ex. D, Letter, dated August 1, 2008; App. Ex. T, Cancelled Check, dated July 12, \n2008; App. Ex. V, Bank Statement, dated September 1, 2008). The debt at SOR 1.i has \nbeen settled and paid (Tr. 33-35; App. Ex. F, Letter, dated September 11, 2008; App. \nEx. U, Cancelled Check, dated August 1, 2008; App. Ex. V, Bank Statement, dated \nSeptember 1, 2008). \n \nApplicant's student loans were transferred to the United States Department of \nEducation for processing.  The total amount of the loans is $40,427.14.  Applicant has \nbeen making the required payments of $293.09.  His account is current (Tr.35-41, 92-\n95; App. Ex. G, Department of Education notice, dated September 14, 2008; App. Ex. \nH, Account statement, dated September 15, 2008, App. Ex. I, Account summary, dated \nSeptember 14, 2008). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed in credit reports \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\".  Applicant had difficulty meeting his financial obligations \nafter he left active duty with the Army and started working in the civilian community. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\"  It has some application.  Since \nthree of the delinquent debts are duplicates of other debts listed in the SOR, there are \nonly 11 delinquent debts.  Of the eleven debts, five have been paid, five are being paid \nunder a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and one, the student loan, is being paid.  The debts still \nbeing paid are current debts.  Applicant frequently encountered financial problems since \nthere were a variety of debts from furniture bills, credit card bills, past due rent, bank \nloans, jewelry store debt, student loans, and a cell phone bill that he was unable to pay.  \nApplicant initially encountered financial difficulty, but he is now solidly employed in the \ncivilian workforce and his debts are under control.  His financial problems should not \nrecur.   \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\" also applies.  Applicant encountered \nfinancial problem when first entering the civilian workforce.  He has taken positive steps \nto resolve those issues.  He paid some of the debts and has filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy plan to assist in paying his remaining delinquent debts.  He acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances to control and manage his debts. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under \ncontrol\" applies.  Applicant twice sought counseling from the bankruptcy court as well as \nan attorney.  He followed their advice and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to assist him in \npaying the debts he had not already paid.  His financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  Applicant is current on paying his student \nloans.  Applicant paid five of the delinquent debts.  He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nwhich will pay the remaining five loans.  Bankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of \nresolving indebtedness.  By filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Applicant did not try to \n\n \n7 \n \n \navoid his delinquent debts but used bankruptcy as a means of managing and paying his \ndebts.  Applicant acted responsibly towards his debts, and established his good-faith \nefforts to resolve his debts.  He mitigated security concerns raised by his financial \nsituation. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers on his \nsecurity clearance application concerning financial issues of judgments and past due \ndebts raises a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC \nDC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \"the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and \nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness\". \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  He initially completed a security \nclearance application that accurately responded to the financial questions.  He left the \ncompany and the application was not processed.  When he returned to the company, \nthe application was updated by the security office as to employment and places he lived \nbut not as to the financial questions.  Applicant did not see the responses to the \nfinancial questions but only saw the signature pages when he signed them.  Applicant \ncredibly testified that when he first completed his security clearance application, he \nlisted the debt that he knew was a security concern.  His credit report for that time \nverifies his financial problem.  He was not asked to update the financial information \nwhen the application was resubmitted.  His supervisor acknowledges the erroneous \nprocess used by the company to complete and submit the new application.  While there \nis a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in \nany written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security \nclearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  \nA falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  Since Applicant listed the financial concerns as he knew them when first \ncompleting the application and did not see the resubmitted application, his failure to list \nthe present delinquent debts was not knowing and willful.  Applicant established he did \nnot deliberately provide false information on the security clearance application with \nintent to deceive.  I find for Appellant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's nine years \nof active duty in the Army and his present service in the Air Force Reserves.  I \nconsidered that he held a security clearance while on active duty.  I considered the \nopinion of his supervisor that he is dedicated to his country and job.  Applicant \nencountered financial problems when leaving active duty and entering the civilian \nworkforce.  He acknowledges his legal obligation to pay his outstanding debts.  He has \npaid five of them, has a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to assist him in paying five more, and is \ncurrent on his student loans.  Applicant lives within his means and meets his personal \nfinancial obligations.  His actions do not indicate poor self control, lack of judgment or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  He is not financially overextended, and \nhis finances do not create a security concern.  He did not provide incomplete \ninformation on his security clearance application with the intent to deceive.  He provided \nthe information accurately when first completing his application but the application was \nnot correctly updated before being resubmitted by his company.  Overall, on balance \nthe record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in the 1980s, having risen to the grade of E-9. He is married, but he and his wife have been legally separated since 2005. Applicant currently lives with a woman (W). He met her on a computer network in May 2005, and they began a romantic relationship the following July, prior to his separation from his spouse. Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of the relationship. W has a lengthy criminal record. Between 1994 and 2004, she was arrested and/or convicted of such offenses as theft, receiving stolen property, forgery, illegal possession of a firearm, having a concealed firearm, possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, burglary, distribution of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, bank fraud, and violation of probation. In 2005, she stated to Applicant that, despite treatment for drug addiction, she had relapsed and had used crack cocaine. Applicant attributed her criminal record to her drug addiction. After the 2005 incident, she underwent detoxification and attended narcotics anonymous (NA) for 90 consecutive days. She has not attended NA since then, nor has she received other counseling or treatment. Applicant stated that W is \u201ca changed person,\u201d (Decision at 4) and that he would know if she relapsed.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Guideline E\nDIGEST: The Judge based his ultimate holding upon the extent to which Applicant\u2019s conduct\nwith a particular woman (W) evidences poor judgment or subjects him to the possibility of\nduress, rather than simply upon the nature of the relationship itself.  The Board finds no reason to\ndisturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the record as a whole in Applicant\u2019s case raises Guideline E\nsecurity concerns.   Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges\nnor on the Board.   The Judge articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision including a\nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made. The Judge explicitly\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s stellar 40-year career.  However, he reasonably explained why\nApplicant\u2019s recent conduct with W weighs more heavily than his prior good record.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation, either\nunder the pertinent mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors, is sustainable on this\nrecord. After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns.

Norman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames H. Shoemaker, Jr., Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 19, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 29, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe Government had presented substantial evidence of Guideline E security concerns; whether the\nJudge erred in concluding that Applicant had failed to mitigate any security concerns contained in\nhis case; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis was erroneous.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following unchallenged findings of fact: Applicant is a 64-year-old\nemployee of a defense contractor.  He retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in the 1980s, having risen\nto the grade of E-9.  He is married, but he and his wife have been legally separated since 2005.\nApplicant currently lives with a woman (W).  He met her on a computer network in May\n2005, and they began a romantic relationship the following July, prior to his separation from his\nspouse.  Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of the relationship.\nW has a lengthy criminal record.

In 2005, she stated to Applicant that, despite treatment for drug\naddiction, she had relapsed and had used crack cocaine.  Applicant attributed her criminal record to\nher drug addiction.  After the 2005 incident, she underwent detoxification and attended narcotics\nanonymous (NA) for 90 consecutive days.  She has not attended NA since then, nor has she received\nother counseling or treatment.  Applicant stated that W is \u201ca changed person,\u201d (Decision at 4) and\nthat he would know if she relapsed.  Were that to occur, Applicant stated that he would place her in\na rehabilitation program.  \n\nSee, e.g., Applicant Exhibit A, a letter of recommendation provided by Applicant\u2019s supervisor.  \u201cIn regard to\n1\nhis personal relationship with [W], [Applicant] early on advised me of her addiction and I am well aware of the\nsituation.\u201d   See also Tr. at 82, testimony by a friend and colleague: \u201cWhen [Applicant] first met the young lady . . . we\ngot together for lunch and he told me what was going on and that he was involved with her and that she had some\nproblems and he wanted to help her along the way.\u201d  Neither of these persons unequivocally demonstrates awareness\nof the full extent of W\u2019s criminal history. \nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.16(d): \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline\n2\n. . . which supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.16(e): \u201c personal conduct,\nor concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\nsuch as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the persons\u2019 personal, professional, or community\nstanding[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.16(g): \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity.\u201d  See also ISCR Case No. 07-\n00852 at 4 (App. Bd.

The general security concern\nraised by Guideline E is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment . . . can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  \n3\n  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s having developed and maintained a long-term\nrelationship with a person having such an extensive criminal record evidences questionable\njudgment.  Additionally, he stated that, while Applicant had disclosed his affair to his wife and to\nhis immediate supervisor, \u201cthe record does not reflect whether he disclosed the full extent of [W\u2019s]\ncriminal record.  In the broader community, including the military community with whom he must\ninteract, it is likely that his personal and professional standing would be adversely affected.\u201d   Id.\n1\nat 7.  Furthermore, he stated that under the facts of this case, Applicant has made himself vulnerable\nto duress or exploitation, either by W or his wife.  The Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s claim that his\nwife actually agreed to his relationship with W, rather than merely having acquiesced, is not\ncorroborated by testimony or other evidence from her.  Applicant argues on appeal that the Judge\nerred in relying upon the extramarital nature of his relationship with W.  However, after reading the\nJudge\u2019s decision as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge based his ultimate holding upon the\nextent to which Applicant\u2019s conduct with W evidences poor judgment or subjects him to the\npossibility of duress, rather than simply upon the nature of the relationship itself.  Considering the\nrecord as a whole, the Board finds no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the record as a\nwhole in Applicant\u2019s case raises Guideline E security concerns.   \n2\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant points to decisions by the Hearing Office, which he argues\nsupport his request for a favorable determination.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.\nHowever, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Moreover, Hearing\nOffice decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR\nCase No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \n\n4\nThe Judge explicitly considered Applicant\u2019s \u201cstellar 40-year career.\u201d  Decision at 9.\nHowever, he reasonably explained why Applicant\u2019s recent conduct with W weighs more heavily than\nhis prior good record.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of\npersuasion as to mitigation, either under the pertinent mitigating conditions or the whole-person\nfactors, is sustainable on this record.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)\n(\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the\ninterests of the national security\u2019\u201d).

He is married, but he and his wife have been legally separated since 2005. Applicant currently lives with a woman (W). He met her on a computer network in May 2005, and they began a romantic relationship the following July, prior to his separation from his spouse. Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of the relationship. W has a lengthy criminal record. Between 1994 and 2004, she was arrested and/or convicted of such offenses as theft, receiving stolen property, forgery, illegal possession of a firearm, having a concealed firearm, possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, burglary, distribution of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, bank fraud, and violation of probation. In 2005, she stated to Applicant that, despite treatment for drug addiction, she had relapsed and had used crack cocaine. Applicant attributed her criminal record to her drug addiction. After the 2005 incident, she underwent detoxification and attended narcotics anonymous (NA) for 90 consecutive days. She has not attended NA since then, nor has she received other counseling or treatment. Applicant stated that W is \u201ca changed person,\u201d (Decision at 4) and that he would know if she relapsed.

Shoemaker, Jr., Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct), based on Applicant\u2019s relationship with a woman with a history of drug \naddiction and criminal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 1, 2006. On \nSeptember 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline E. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nJanuary 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 7, 2008; answered it on October 20, \n2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on October 21, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October \n30, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on the following day. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on November 17, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 9, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted \nin evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented the \ntestimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 18, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations but denied that his \nconduct raised security concerns. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 64-year-old exercise planner employed by a defense contractor. \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 1962 until April 1989, \nwhen he retired as a master gunnery sergeant (pay grade E-9). During his military \nservice, he was awarded the Marine Combat Action Ribbon, the Air Medal, the Navy \nAchievement Medal for valor, and numerous other decorations and awards.  \n \nAfter retiring from the Marine Corps, Applicant completed his undergraduate \ncollege education and then obtained a master\u2019s degree in adult education. He worked \nas a federal employee from February 1992 to August 2002, when he retired. In April \n1997, he received the Meritorious Civilian Service award for his performance of duty \nwhile in charge of a counterdrug intelligence program (AX C). From about 1970, while in \nthe Marine Corps and as a civilian employee, he had a security clearance and access to \nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). He worked in intelligence operations \nthroughout his military and civilian service. He has never had a security violation. He \nheld two short-term jobs in the private sector, from August to September 2005 and from \nFebruary to April 2006, when he was hired by his current employer. As of the date of his \nresponse to the SOR, he continued to hold a clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was married in March 1969 and has been legally separated since \nNovember 2005. His spouse is 75 years old (GX 1 at Section 13/15). They have no \nchildren.  \n \n \nApplicant currently resides with a 46-year-old woman, a native of Guam. She has \nan adult daughter whose husband is serving in the U.S. Navy. His companion is \ndescribed on his security clearance application as his cohabitant/fianc\u00e9. He met her on \na computer network, and she disclosed that she had a prison record (Tr. 75). After \nabout a month of online correspondence, they met in person in May 2005 (Tr. 76). Their \nrelationship became romantic around July 2005. They now live together in a home \nApplicant has rented, and they are sexually intimate. When asked by Department \n\n \n3 \n \n \nCounsel if he was in an \u201cadulterous relationship,\u201d he responded, \u201cIf you want to call it \nthat, yes, sir.\u201d He testified he deeply loves his companion (Tr. 44, 53, 56). \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is aware of his relationship with another woman and does not \ndesire to terminate the marriage. Applicant likewise does not desire to terminate his \nmarriage, because of concerns about his spouse\u2019s financial security and his desire not \nto disturb her \u201ccomfort zone.\u201d His spouse has never worked and has no income \nindependent of Applicant. She lives in the house they jointly own. Applicant pays for all \nher medical needs, provides her with a vehicle, maintains the property, and gives her \n$400 to $600 per month in spending money (Tr. 53-54).  \n \n \nApplicant testified he has an amicable relationship with his spouse. He was living \nwith his spouse when he met his companion, but the marital relationship had cooled to \nthe point they were living as brother and sister (Tr. 71, 75). His spouse has met his \ncompanion. Applicant and his companion have visited his spouse in her home (Tr. 61). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor is generally aware of his situation and has \nstated he has no doubt about Applicant\u2019s good judgment, trustworthiness, honesty, or \nintegrity (AX A). He rated Applicant as exceeding standards in 10 of 12 performance \nfactors, meeting standards in two factors, and described his overall performance as \noutstanding (AX B). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s companion has a long criminal record (GX 2). All her criminal activity \noccurred while she was residing in Guam (Tr. 57-58). She was arrested twice in \nNovember 1994, the first time for three counts of theft and receiving stolen property and \ntwo counts of forgery, and the second time for illegal possession of a firearm, having a \nconcealed firearm, and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. She was \narrested in May 1995 for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and arrested in June \n1995 for theft of property. In October 1995 she was arrested for burglary and soliciting \nprostitution. In May 1996 she was arrested for burglary and possession of stolen \nproperty. In January 1997 she was arrested for distribution of methamphetamine, and \nshe was sentenced to prison for 34 months.  \n \nThe records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation reflect that Applicant\u2019s \ncompanion was a member of a group responsible for passing numerous fraudulent and \nforged payroll checks. In December 1998, she was arrested for distribution of \nmethamphetamine and bank fraud. She was sentenced to prison for 13 months for the \ndrug offense and 10 months, served concurrently, for the bank fraud. In April 2000, she \nwas charged with two counts of bank fraud and violation of her supervised release, and \nwas sentenced to prison for a term not reflected in the record.  \n \nIn July 2001, Applicant\u2019s companion was charged with violation of her supervised \nrelease and sentenced to 11 months in prison. In June 2002, she was charged with \npossession of drug paraphernalia and being under the influence of a controlled \nsubstance, but the charges were dismissed. In August 2002, she was again charged \nwith possession of drug paraphernalia and being under the influence of a controlled \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsubstance. She was charged with violation of probation in September 2003 and jailed \nfor 14 months. She was again charged with violation of probation in March 2004 and \njailed for 14 months.  \n \n \nAccording to Applicant, his companion\u2019s criminal record was all the result of her \ndrug addiction that began when she was about 11 years old (Tr. 45). When he met her \nin May 2005, she was living with her daughter and being treated for drug addiction. In \nAugust 2005, Applicant\u2019s companion admitted she had relapsed and used crack \ncocaine. Applicant responded to her relapse by purchasing a plane ticket to Guam and \nputting her on the plane. While his companion was at an intermediate stop and waiting \nto connect with the flight to Guam, she and Applicant talked by cell phone, and she told \nhim she would not return to Guam because she would be back in the same environment \nthat caused her problems. Applicant believed she was suicidal when they talked. \nApplicant told her she needed to go through detoxification and start attending Narcotics \nAnonymous (NA) meetings. She went through detoxification and they attended NA \nmeetings together for 90 consecutive days. His companion did not undergo drug \ntreatment or counseling because they could not afford it at the time (Tr. 65). Although a \nmember of the NA group was designated as his companion\u2019s sponsor, Applicant \ndecided he would be her unofficial sponsor (Tr. 60). She did not receive any counseling \nor treatment and did not attend any further NA meetings after the 90 consecutive \nmeetings (Tr. 60). \n \nApplicant believes she has not relapsed since August 2005, and that she is a \nchanged person (Tr. 47-51, 57-58). He testified he knows his companion well enough \nthat he would know if she relapsed, and he also believes she would tell him (Tr. 62-63). \nHe testified that he would respond to a relapse by taking his companion to a \u201cpsych \nclinic or whatever,\u201d and place her in a rehabilitation program (Tr. 65). \n \n \nWhen his counsel asked him what he would do if his companion asked him to \ncompromise sensitive information, he testified:  \n \n[L]ook, I\u2019ve been in this business for 40 years, the intelligence business. \nAlmost 30 of those years I\u2019ve [had] SCI clearance. I\u2019ve been a special \nsecurity officer, where I handle this stuff all the time. \n \nI ran preliminary inquiries and investigations on people. I\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019m \nnot going to compromise. If that happened again, first of all she would \nnever be stupid enough to ask me that, she knows better. She knows me. \n \nI really, I know, I\u2019m not supposed to get upset, but I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not \ngoing to happen, it simply will not happen. I will not allow it. I\u2019ve done this \na long time. \n \nI\u2019ve been in positions similar to [department counsel\u2019s] when I worked in \ncounter intelligence and it\u2019s not going to happen. She knows it\u2019s not going \nto happen. It\u2019s as simple as that. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to tell it like it is. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(Tr. 63-64.) Applicant reacted indignantly to questions about his integrity, honesty, and \njudgment. He testified: \u201cI\u2019m not going to go ahead and compromise [the] United States \nof America for any reason, I don\u2019t care what it is. And by questioning my integrity, my \nhonesty, my judgment, to me, I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s a slap in the face. Okay, that\u2019s the way I \nsee it.\u201d (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nA friend of Applicant who retired from the Navy as a senior chief petty officer (pay \ngrade E-8) testified he worked with Applicant from 1995 to 2002. He testified he would \nrank Applicant first or second among the hundreds of intelligence professionals he had \nworked with. He described Applicant as \u201chonest to a fault\u201d and a person of sound \njudgment (Tr. 80-81). He testified he has met Applicant\u2019s companion and knows her \nbackground. He believes Applicant is a very compassionate person who will go out of \nthe way for someone who needs help (Tr. 83).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant maintains a \u201cclose relationship\u201d with his \ncompanion, who has an extensive criminal record, including two incarcerations in a \nfederal prison. Applicant admits the relationship and his companion\u2019s criminal record. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d The disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d), (e), and (g) are relevant. AG \u00b6 16(d) is raised by the following: \n[C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThree aspects of AG \u00b6 16(d) are relevant: (1) whether Applicant has exhibited \n\u201cquestionable judgment,\u201d (2) whether he has exhibited \u201cunwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations,\u201d and (3) whether his adulterous relationship with his companion \ndemonstrates a \u201cpattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d  \n \nApplicant was not employed and did not have access to classified information \nwhen he began his relationship with his companion. Nevertheless, I conclude Applicant \nexercised questionable judgment when he fostered an online relationship with a person \nwith an extensive criminal record and allowed it to become romantic and sexually \nintimate, while he was still married. I would expect that Applicant, with his long public \nservice and extensive experience in the intelligence community, would be cautious in \npursuing a relationship with a recovering drug addict with a long criminal history. \nInstead, he went from initial contact to being deeply in love in the space of three \nmonths\u2014a whirlwind courtship by any standard. While Applicant has focused on his \ncompanion\u2019s drug addiction, her past also includes weapons offenses, bank fraud, \nforgery, burglary, theft of property, possession of stolen property, and prostitution.  \nI am satisfied that Applicant honestly believes his spouse does not object to his \nrelationship, but his spouse did not testify or submit a written statement, leaving open \nthe question whether she has agreed to Applicant\u2019s arrangement or has simply \nacquiesced. Given the strong personality exhibited by Applicant during the hearing, \nmere acquiescence cannot be ruled out. \nApplicant has a long record of impeccable public service. He does appear, \nhowever, to compartmentalize his professional life and his personal life, and he has \ndemonstrated that he is unwilling to comply with his marital obligations. Based on his \nlong record of public service, however, I believe he would be less likely to disregard job-\nrelated rules. With respect to the issue whether there is a \u201cpattern\u201d of rules violations, I \nnote that his adulterous relationship, while continuous and long-standing, is a single \ncontinuing act rather than multiple independent transgressions. As such, it may not be a \n\u201cpattern\u201d as the term is used in AG \u00b6 16(d). Nevertheless, based on Applicant\u2019s exercise \nof questionable judgment, I conclude AG \u00b6 16(d) applies. \n \nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(e) is raised by \u201cpersonal conduct, or \nconcealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Applicant has \ndisclosed his relationship with his spouse, his immediate supervisor, and a long-time \nfriend and former co-worker. His personal and professional standing with his supervisor \nand his friend apparently have not been affected by it, although the record does not \nreflect whether he disclosed the full extent of his companion\u2019s criminal record. In the \nbroader community, including the military community with whom he must interact, it is \nlikely that his personal and professional standing would be adversely affected.  \n \n \nI am satisfied that Applicant is not vulnerable to direct and overt exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by threats of disclosure, because of his background and \n\n \n8 \n \n \npersonality. He expressed no shame or remorse about his relationship and was \nindignant about the suggestion that it might affect his suitability for a clearance. He has \nadopted a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d stance with his companion and made it clear that he \nwill not tolerate further criminal conduct. His extensive experience in counter-\nintelligence has made him especially sensitive and knowledgeable about efforts to \ngather sensitive information. He testified emphatically that he would never permit his \ncompanion or anyone else to exploit him.  \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s extramarital relationship has increased his \nvulnerability to indirect exploitation, manipulation, or duress. He has made himself \nvulnerable to vindictive financial claims, unfounded criminal complaints, acts designed \nto sabotage his credit rating, identity theft, and similar means of coercion or retribution \ninitiated by his companion (especially if he should decide to terminate their relationship \nat some time in the future) or his spouse. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(e) applies. \n \n \nFinally, the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(g) is raised by \u201cassociation with \npersons involved in criminal activity.\u201d This disqualifying condition applies only to persons \nwho are presently involved in criminal activity, not those who have engaged in criminal \nactivity in the past. Applicant met his companion in May 2005, while she was struggling \nwith and being treated for drug addiction. They were romantically involved by July 2005, \nand his companion relapsed and used crack cocaine in August 2005. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n16(g) is not raised by his companion\u2019s criminal record in Guam and her violations of \nprobation before they met, but it is raised by his association with a crack cocaine user in \nAugust 2005. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6 16(a) and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is ongoing, did not occur under \u201cunique circumstances,\u201d and casts \ndoubt on his good judgment. Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the \nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his behavior, but he has attempted to justify it. He \nwas indignant that anyone would question it, and it is likely to continue. This mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). \nApplicant receives credit under this mitigating condition for disclosing his relationship to \nhis spouse and his employer. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cassociation \nwith persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that \ndo not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). Applicant\u2019s companion \nhas not engaged in criminal activity since August 2005, but doubts about his good \njudgment remain.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant had a stellar 40-year career as a Marine and a civilian in public service. \nHis relationship with his companion began after his second retirement and when he was \nnot contemplating the impact of that relationship on future employment or his eligibility \nfor a security clearance. His conduct in searching for companionship and becoming \ndeeply involved with his companion despite her history, while he was still married and \nliving with his spouse, was a dramatic behavioral change.  \n \n \nExcept for one character witness and a testimonial from his supervisor, Applicant \nwas the sole source of evidence regarding the character and background of his \ncompanion and the reaction of his spouse to the situation. Applicant presented himself \nas sincere and candid. I believe he honestly described his companion and his spouse \nas he perceived them, but he was not testifying as an impartial observer. He believes \n\n \n10 \n \n \nhis companion is a changed person, but he has no expertise in prognosis of future drug \ninvolvement or in determining whether she has overcome the causes of her long \ncriminal record. He presented no testimony or written documents from qualified medical \nprofessionals supporting his conclusions. Similarly, he presented no evidence to \ncorroborate his assertion that his spouse did not object to his conduct. His indignation at \nbeing questioned indicates his lack of appreciation for the security concerns raised by \nhis conduct. He is supremely confident in his ability to detect efforts to obtain \ninformation from him and to thwart them, but he is surprisingly na\u00efve in his lack of \nappreciation of his vulnerability.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant, 44 years old, completed two years of courses at a community college. He married for the first time while he serving on active duty in the military. He married a second time in 1992 and divorced in June 1996. Applicant married his current wife in November 1996. She had several children. Together with his own, they now have 10 children who range in age from 3 to 28 years old. His wife does not work outside the home (GE 1; Tr. 27-28; 39; 101). Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1984 to 1987. He remained in the active reserves from 1987 to 1992. He worked for 18 years for a large telecommunications company. From 1990, he was a cable technician, and in 2000, he was promoted to manager. He has worked in the security field as a security officer for several companies.

MacKinnon, Esquire, Deputy Chief Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Lynne Zusman, Esquire \n \n \n \n \n________________ \n \nDecision \n________________ \n \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude \nthat Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is granted. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on November 3, 2007. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nJune 26, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn July 30, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 In his Answer to the SOR,3 signed and \nnotarized on September 25, 2008, Applicant admitted to the allegations at \u00b6\u00b61.a. and \n1.b. under Guideline F and denied the remaining allegations at \u00b6\u00b61.c. through 1.g. He \nalso denied the three allegations under Guideline E. He requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 20, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on February 26, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nMarch 24, 2009, setting a hearing date of April 16, 2009. On approximately April 1, \n2009, Applicant retained an attorney, who moved to continue the hearing date. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection, and the Motion was granted. An Amended \nNotice of Hearing was issued on April 16, 2009, setting a new hearing date of April 24, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered eight exhibits. Seven were marked \nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 and admitted without objection. The \ngovernment also offered one demonstrative exhibit, marked for identification as GE 8. \nApplicant reserved the right to object (Tr. 21), but made no further objection, and it was \nadmitted as GE 8. The government later offered an additional exhibit related to GE 5; it \nwas admitted without objection as GE 5a (Tr. 89). In addition, the Answer in the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s file was incomplete. Department Counsel provided a copy of the \ncomplete Answer. It was admitted, without objection, as GE 9 (Tr. 94). \n \nApplicant testified and also offered seven exhibits. They were marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through G and admitted without objection. I held the record \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. Department Counsel \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n3 Applicant attached the following five documents to his Answer: 1 - 2008 letter regarding settlement \noffer on allegation 1.c.; 2 - 2008 letter showing $50 payment on allegation 1.d.; 3 - 2008 letter regarding \nsettlement offer on allegation 1.e.; 4 - documents relating to the debt at allegation 1.f.; 5 - September \n2008 credit bureau report. \n\n \n \n3\nforwarded without objection Applicant\u2019s timely submission of ten documents. I admitted \nthe documents as AE H through Q. DOHA received the transcript on May 1, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement \nof Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 44 years old, completed two years of courses at a community college. \nHe married for the first time while he serving on active duty in the military. He married a \nsecond time in 1992 and divorced in June 1996. Applicant married his current wife in \nNovember 1996. She had several children. Together with his own, they now have 10 \nchildren who range in age from 3 to 28 years old. His wife does not work outside the \nhome (GE 1; Tr. 27-28; 39; 101). \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1984 to 1987. He \nremained in the active reserves from 1987 to 1992. He worked for 18 years for a large \ntelecommunications company. From 1990, he was a cable technician, and in 2000, he \nwas promoted to manager. He has worked in the security field as a security officer for \nseveral companies. He is also a member of the National Guard. He currently receives \nincome from three positions: as a senior cable technician; as a security officer; and a \nmember of the Army National Guard since 2007 (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 28-29; 32; 100). \n \nHis income from each position varies depending on the hours worked. In May \n2009, Applicant received net pay of $300 from the National Guard. His net pay at the \nsecurity firm for a two-week period in February 2009 was $572, but for two weeks in \nApril, he earned net pay of $825. In his position as a senior cable technician for a \ncommunications company, Applicant earns $21.35 per hour. His net pay for two-week \nperiods in March and April 2009 varied from $1,120 to $1,507. His 2007 tax return \nshows wages of approximately $126,400. In 2008, his wages were higher because he \nreceived a buyout package from his communications employer that, after taxes, \namounted to $39,746 (AE M; O). \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Statement of Reasons alleges four delinquent debts, two \nbankruptcy petitions, and a home foreclosure. Applicant filed a bankruptcy petition in \n1995 (allegation 1.a.). A significant amount of debt accrued during his second marriage, \nbecause of his own and his wife\u2019s spending habits. Applicant went through a difficult \ndivorce. His attorney advised him to file for bankruptcy. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy was \ndischarged in July 1995 (GE 7; Tr. 35; 101-102).  \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s remarriage in 1996 resulted in many more dependents, he \nwas able to meet his financial obligations. However, in approximately 2000, the \ntelecommunications firm where he was employed went through a restructuring. \nApplicant\u2019s wages decreased, debts started to accrue and he started to fall behind on \nhis mortgage. He contacted an attorney, who advised him to file for bankruptcy and to \n\n \n \n4\nsell his home. In February 2002, he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that would \nallow him to reorganize his finances and pay off the accrued debts. Applicant's \nmortgage lender moved for relief from the stay afforded under Chapter 13, and \npermission to foreclose. However, Applicant was able to sell his home, and in October \n2002, the mortgage loan was paid. He also moved to dismiss the bankruptcy petition, \nand used the funds from the sale of his home to pay his debts (GE 5; 5a; 6; Tr. 103-105; \n113-114).  \n \nApplicant denies the allegation that his home was foreclosed in 2004 because he \nhad sold his home in 2002, and in 2004 he was living in an apartment. The home listed \nas foreclosed in Applicant's 2007 credit bureau report was the house he sold in 2002. \nThe settlement sheet from that sale shows that the mortgage loan listed in the credit \nbureau report was satisfied in 2002. The settlement sheet also shows the address of the \napartment where Applicant was living on the settlement date. He later purchased \nanother home in 2004 (GE 2; 5a; 9; AE K; Tr. 54-57). \n \nIn 2008, Applicant worked for a communications company. The company \ndownsized by eliminating 5,000 management positions, including Applicant's. He \naccepted a buyout so that he could use the lump-sum payment to pay off outstanding \ndebts. He received $59,695; which after taxes gave him a net a payout of $39,000 (AE \nB; M; Tr. 36-37) \n \nCurrently, Applicant has closed several credit card accounts, and is timely on the \none remaining credit card. One car is paid off, and he is making timely payments on the \nother. Applicant also has approximately $7,000 in retirement savings (AE O; P; Tr. 130-\n131). \n \n \nThe status of the SOR debts follows. \n \n$  \nAllegation 1.c. - $7,058: This debt represents a deficiency \nbalance remaining after sale of a repossessed automobile. The \ncreditor accepted a settlement. Applicant's September 2008 credit \nbureau report shows that the debt to this creditor is paid (GE 2; 4; \nAnswer documents 1; 5)  \n \n\u2022 \nAllegation 1.d. - $1,869: Applicant established a payment plan \nfor this school debt under which $50 per month is automatically \ndeducted form his bank account. AE J shows payments starting in \nNovember 2007. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant has reduced \nthe balance to $1,218. (GE 2; 3; 4; AE I; Answer document 2; Tr. 47-\n48) \n \n$  \nAllegation 1.e. - $15,303: Applicant received a settlement offer of \n$5,000 on this automobile loan. He paid the settlement amount, with \nthe last installment of $2,500 paid on August 1, 2008. The creditor\u2019s \n\n \n \n5\nrights in the vehicle were released as of December 2008 (AE J; \nAnswer document 3; Tr. 51-52). \n \n$  \nAllegation 1.f. - $12,250: This allegation is a duplicate. The \ncreditor listed at allegation 1.c. is the collection agency for the creditor \nlisted at allegation 1.f. A July 2008 letter from the collection agent for \nthis debt shows that although the two debts appear to have different \naccount numbers, they represent the original creditor\u2019s account \nnumber and the subsequent creditor\u2019s account number. (Answer \ndocuments 1; 4; 5). \n \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in November 2007 in which \nhe was asked whether or not he had property repossessed or wages garnished in the \nprevious seven years (question 27b). He answered \u201cYes\u201d and listed an automobile \nrepossession in 2006. The government alleges that he falsified by not entering \ninformation about a home foreclosure in 2002 (Tr. 78-79).  \n \n \n \nApplicant was also asked whether or not he had debts more than six months \npast due in the previous seven years (question 28a) and whether he had debts more \nthan three months past due at the time he completed the application (question 28b). \nHe answered \u201cNo.\u201d The government alleges that he deliberately falsified these \nanswers.  Applicant testified that he thought the questions were unclear, and was \nunsure about how to answer them. He and his wife went over the questions together, \nand reviewed their financial efforts over the past several years, and determined that \ntheir debts had not been over the stated time.  \n \nThe question wasn't clear.  As stated before, I was trying to handle all \nthe debt, trying to pay off the debt and manage the accounts, as best I \ncould.  In calling the various lenders, if you will, to try to work out \nvarious agreements on each account that I've listed. So, I wasn't sure \nthat any of the debt was 90 to 100 days old.  And, I asked my wife, we \nwere sitting down together, when we actually filled out the e-QIP \napplication.  And, both of us had stated at the time, we wasn't sure \nthat any of the debt was 90 to 100 days old.  I knew I had some debt \nthat was maybe 30 days late, and that I was working on trying to pay it \noff.  However, when this question asked me was it 90 to 100 days, I \nwas like that was 3 months to 6 months, are we that late on any of the \ndebt and what we both came up with was no. (Tr. 80). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b619a (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \nAG \u00b619c (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply based on Applicant\u2019s \nsubstantial delinquencies between 2002 and 2008. There is no evidence of other \ndisqualifying conditions such as frivolous spending, or debts related to alcoholism, \ngambling or deceptive practices.  \n \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate \nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20b, 20c and 20d apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20b applies (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances). When Applicant remarried in 1996, his \nfamily and his wife\u2019s family together comprised ten children and two parents. His wife \ndoes not work outside the home, and he has been the sole support for this large family \nfor the past 13 years. He tried to support this large family on one income. In addition, \nhis employer restructured the company, and Applicant's pay declined. He acted \nresponsibly by filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. However, he was able to sell his home, \nand withdraw the petition. He again showed responsibility by using the funds from the \nsale of his home to pay his debts. Since 2007, Applicant also sought to provide \nsufficient income by working several jobs simultaneously. He currently has three jobs. \nApplicant has acted responsibly and made consistent efforts to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \nAlthough Applicant has not received counselling, he does have his financial \nsituation under control. Of the four debts alleged, Applicant owed only three, as one \nwas a duplicate. He has paid two of the three debts, and has a long-standing plan in \nplace with automatic payment deductions for the remaining debt. He significantly \nreduced his delinquent debts after receiving the buyout in 2008, as shown by his 2009 \ncredit bureau report. AG \u00b6 20c (the person has received or is receiving counseling for \nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control) and AG \u00b6 20d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \n\n \n \n8\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying condition under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities \n \nThe government alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his answers to \nquestions 27(b), 28(a) and 28(b) on his 2008 security clearance application. \nFalsification of a security clearance application implicates AG \u00b6 16(a); however, \napplication of this disqualifying condition requires a deliberate intent to conceal. Here, \nApplicant did not intentionally hide relevant information from the government. If he had \nintended to conceal the fact that financial issues were a concern, he would not have \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to question 27(b), and disclosed that his wages had been garnished. \nHe would not have disclosed that he owed more than $10,000 on the repossessed \nautomobile. Moreover, Applicant did not intentionally conceal that a property had been \nforeclosed, because his home had not been foreclosed.  \n \nAs to his past due debts, Applicant credibly testified that he tried to correctly \nanswer questions 28(a) and (b). He and his wife sat together and reviewed their bills \nand their recent payment efforts, the dates on which they had made payments, the \nsettlements, and the dates of their payment plans. They determined that the correct \nanswer was \u201cNo\u201d because they concluded that none of their bills had been either 180 \ndays past due or 90 days past due. If Applicant\u2019s intent had been to conceal his \nfinancial problems, it is highly unlikely he would have been candid about the \ngarnishment and repossession in the preceding question. Applicant\u2019s disclosure put the \ngovernment on notice that his finances represented a security concern. I conclude that \nhe did not intend to falsify his security clearance application, and AG \u00b6 16 (a) does not \napply. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \n\n \n \n9\nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant accrued debts over the past several years. He has paid two of the \nthree debts. He has been making payments through a long-standing payment plan for \nthe single remaining debt. Over the past several years, he has worked several jobs \nsimultaneously in an effort to keep his large family afloat. He acted with reason and \nmaturity, using funds from his house sale in 2002 to avoid bankruptcy and pay his \ndebts. He accepted a buyout in 2008, so that he could use the lump-sum payment to \npay off debts. He has made significant headway, so that his 2009 credit bureau report \nlists only one past-due debt, which Applicant is currently paying through a payment \nplan. Applicant\u2019s behavior demonstrates a sincere effort to meet his financial \nobligations. A fair and common-sense assessment of the available information bearing \non Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has satisfied the doubts \nabout his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.g.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 2.c.  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n10\n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

McCormack, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 19, 2006. On May \n8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 18, 2009; answered it on June 25, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on July \nNovember 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n23, 2009. On July 29, 2009, Department Counsel withdrew the allegations under \nGuideline E. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 31, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on the same day. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 6, \n2009, scheduling the hearing for September 1, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. \nHis admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, working overseas \nas a network controller. He has worked for his current employer since May 2006. He \nreceived a clearance in September 1996 and has held it continuously until the present \n(Tr. 9). \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school, using it at least once a week \n(GX 7 at 8). In 1994, after he graduated from high school, he started using marijuana \none to three times a week, cocaine one to two times a year, methamphetamine two to \nfour times a month, and he used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) about five times (GX \n7 at 8; Tr. 30). In October 1994, he recognized he was \u201cin a bad state,\u201d and he \nvoluntarily entered and completed a two-week, inpatient treatment program (Tr. 31). He \ncompleted an outpatient aftercare program, consisting of group counseling, in February \n1995.  \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from April 1996 to August 1998, \nand was released from active duty as a sergeant (pay grade E-5). He received a \nCertificate of Achievement in March 1998 (AX B-8), and he was twice awarded the \nArmy Achievement Medal (AX B-3; AX B-4). He was discharged early to accept an \nArmy Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship (AX B-9; AX B-10). \n \nIn 1999, while attending college, Applicant resumed his marijuana use. He \nestimated he used it 10 to 15 times at social occasions at parties and in connection with \nalcohol consumption (Tr. 33-34; GX 3 at 4-5). He dropped out of college after one \nsemester and discontinued his participation in ROTC (Tr. 37). He was in the individual \nready reserve (IRR) from the date of his release from active duty until he joined an \nactive U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) unit in January 2003.  \n \nApplicant was charged with drunken driving in February 2004. He attended a \ntwo-day group counseling program for alcohol abuse, mandated as a result of the \ncharge of drunken driving (GX 3 at 2).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s USAR evaluation report for the period from September 2004 through \nAugust 2005 rated him as \u201camong the best\u201d and recommended assignment to greater \nresponsibilities (AX A-1). His evaluation report for the period from September 2005 to \nJanuary 2006 rated him as \u201cfully capable\u201d and described him as mature and \nconscientious (AX A-2). He was awarded the Joint Service Achievement Medal in \nNovember 2005 (AX B-2). In March 2006, he received a Commanding General\u2019s \nCertificate of Appreciation (AX B-5). Later in the same month, he participated in an \nunannounced urinalysis administered by his USAR unit, and he tested positive for \nmarijuana. An action to administratively discharge him for drug involvement was \ninitiated but apparently never completed. He was held past his discharge date and \neventually discharged from the USAR in January 2007 with a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions (GX 7 at 9; AX F).  \n \nApplicant last used an illegal substance in March 2006, after returning from a \ndeployment with his USAR unit (GX 3 at 4; Tr. 15). In June 2006, shortly after he began \nworking for his current employer, he voluntarily enrolled in an outpatient substance \nabuse program. Upon entering the program, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent \nand nicotine dependent (AX D-2). He completed the program in August 2007 (GX 3 at \n2). Although he was advised to participate in Alcoholics Anonymous when he entered \nthe program, he does not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous or any similar \norganization (GX 3 at 2). He testified he last consumed alcohol on December 31, 2008, \nwhen he had a single beer with his brother (Tr. 43). He intends to limit his alcohol \nconsumption to a single beer or glass of wine on an occasional special event (Tr. 45). \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2007 performance appraisal from his current employer rated him as \nconsistently exceeding expectations in his quality of work. His overall rating described \nhim as meeting and occasionally exceeding expectations (AX C-1). His 2008 \nperformance appraisal rated him as meeting and occasionally exceeding expectations \nin all performance factors (AX C-2). \n \nOn December 8, 2008, Applicant obtained a follow-up assessment of his \nsubstance abuse. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in sustained full remission. \nThe prognosis was \u201cgood given his current lifestyle.\u201d Neither his diagnosis in June 2006 \nnor his evaluation in December 2008 mentioned any drug dependence (AX D-1). At the \nhearing, he presented a signed statement of intent to refrain from future drug abuse, \nwith provision for automatic revocation of his clearance for any future drug abuse. In his \nstatement, he declared that he had not used marijuana since March 2006 and had not \nused any other illegal substances since 1994 (AX E). \n \nApplicant now lives and works overseas, and he has made new friends from \namong his co-workers. He does not associate with heavy drinkers or drug-users (Tr. \n42). He is in a serious relationship with a young woman, and they are awaiting the birth \nof their child in December 2009 (Tr. 42, 55).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleagues and supervisors uniformly hold him in high regard, \ncommenting on his intelligence, dependability, honesty, loyalty, and integrity (AX G-1 \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthrough G-13). His site manager considers him a valuable asset (AX G-1). Another site \nmanager commented on his trustworthiness and reliability (AX G-9) A colleague \ncommented on his sound moral judgment (AX G-5). A friend mentioned his \u201crock-\nsteady\u2019 sound judgment (AX G-8). One colleague described him as a model employee \n(AX G-11). His site manager and one of his colleagues believe he participates in \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AX G-1 and AX G-7), but this belief is contradicted by \nApplicant\u2019s responses to DOHA interrogatories on August 1, 2008 (GX 3 at 2). His \nmother and brother describe him as a changed person who is now focused on the future \n(AX G-12 and G-13). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses use or misuse of Adrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens). AG \n\u00b6 24(a)(1).  \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): Aany drug abuse,@ which is defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as Athe illegal use \nof a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical \ndirection.@;  \nAG \u00b6 25(b): \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use\u201d;  \nAG \u00b6 25(c):  Aillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution\u201d; and  \nAG \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d \nAll these disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \n\n \n6 \n \n \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \nAlthough Applicant was evaluated for substance abuse on several occasions and \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent, there is no evidence he was ever diagnosed as a drug \nabuser or drug dependent. Thus, AG \u00b6 25(d) (\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug \ndependence\u201d) and AG \u00b6 25(e) (): \u201cevaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram\u201d) are not raised. \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement was frequent and did not happen under such circumstances that make \nrecurrence unlikely. Thus, the analysis turns on the first prong of \u00b6 26(a) (Ahappened so \nlong ago@), which focuses on the recency of drug involvement. There are no Abright line@ \nrules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent marijuana use was in March 2006, three and a half years \nago. He voluntarily entered and completed a drug treatment program after he was \ndischarged from the USAR and began his current employment. He found new friends, \nchanged his environment, and demonstrated his intention to remain drug-free. He is \nwell regarded by his colleagues, superiors, and friends. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b). Applicant has established all four indicia of \u201cdemonstrated intent\u201d under this \nmitigating condition. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). Applicant voluntarily entered substance \nabuse treatment programs in October 1994 and in June 2006. Neither was \u201cprescribed\u201d \nby a medical professional. He was diagnosed in October 1994 as alcohol dependent, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbut neither program diagnosed him as suffering from drug dependence or drug abuse. \nHe successfully completed both programs. His follow-up evaluation in December 2008 \nalso diagnosed him as alcohol dependent in full remission, but made no mention of drug \nabuse or drug dependence. The favorable diagnosis in December 2008 referred only to \nhis alcohol dependence, and it was made before he consumed alcohol on December \n31, 2008. Applicant receives some credit under this mitigating condition, but it is not fully \nestablished. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was sincere, candid, and remorseful at the hearing. He is a talented \nnetwork controller, respected by his colleagues, supervisors, and friends. His drug and \nalcohol problems peaked shortly after he graduated from high school, but he recognized \nhis problem and sought help in October 1994. After a successful tour of active duty in \nthe Army, he started attending college, but he fell back into his pattern of substance \nabuse and dropped out of school. He last used marijuana in March 2006. When he was \noffered his current job, he voluntarily entered another outpatient treatment program. He \ndoes not participate in AA or any similar organization, but he has new friends, a job he \nfinds rewarding, a serious romantic relationship, and a child soon to be born.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol dependence and alcohol-related misconduct was not alleged \nin the SOR, but his marijuana use frequently was in conjunction with alcohol \nconsumption. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (Uncharged \nmisconduct may be considered as part of whole-person analysis.). He has decided to \nconsume alcohol infrequently and in moderation, thereby undermining the premise of \nhis recent diagnosis as alcohol dependent in full remission. Nevertheless, he has clearly \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndemonstrated his intent to leave his hard-drinking, drug-using lifestyle behind. By \nsubmitting his statement of intent, he has agreed to self-imposed probation, putting his \njob and his future on the line if he uses any illegal substances in the future. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On July 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 13, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August \n28, 2008. The case was assigned to me on September 16, 2008. On October 21, 2008, \na Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for November 19, 2008. The \ncase was heard on that date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted \nas Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant testified and offered four exhibits \nwhich were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-D. The record was \nJanuary 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nheld open until December 19, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  \nHe timely submitted a 30-page document that was admitted as AE E, and a three-page \ndocument that was admitted as AE F with no objection. The transcript was received on \nDecember 8, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.

In October 2008, he formally disputed the delinquent \naccounts on his credit reports. (Tr at 21; Gov 3; AE A; AE B; AE D.) In his divorce \ndecree, Applicant was held responsible for paying the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, \n1.e, and 1.i.

He decided not to purchase the home and disputed this debt with \nthe credit reporting agencies. (Tr at 44-45.) Status of debt uncertain. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l, $2,960 cell phone collection account. Applicant states this was a \ncompany phone and the employer was trying to hold him responsible for the bill. He \ndisputed to account with the credit reporting agencies.

Status of debt uncertain. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p through 1.u are all medical accounts. Applicant has had some recent \nmedical issues. Applicant resolved all of these medical accounts within the past year. \n(Tr at 50-51, 65; AE E at 15-20.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p through 1.u are found for Applicant.  \n \nApplicant states that he had no intent to deceive the government when he \ncompleted his security clearance application. He did not know the extent of the \ndelinquent debts at the time he completed his application. He had some idea that he \nhad some financial problems but was not sure. (Tr at 35-37.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSince 2001, Applicant had several periods of unemployment. In December 2001, \nhe was laid off and unemployed for 20 months. He collected unemployment the first \nnine months. The unemployment payments of $300 a week did not match his previous \nincome. After 20 months, he had a job for one week. He was then unemployed for three \nmonths. He then found a job for three months. After this job, he was unemployed for two \nweeks and found a job for one year. Upon completion of that job in 2005, he was \nunemployed for nine months until he was hired by his current employer. (Tr at 23-27.)  \n \nApplicant has not attended financial counseling. He does not own real estate and \ndoes not have a checking account. He deposits his paycheck in his roommate\u2019s account \nand she pays the bills.  She keeps track of his expenses because he travels a lot with \nhis job. His car is paid off. He is current on federal and state income taxes. (Tr at 52-\n58.) After the hearing, Applicant submitted a recent financial statement. His net monthly \ntake home pay is $2,940. His monthly expenses are $870. After expenses, he has \n$2,070 left over each month. (AE F at 2.)    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has encountered financial \ndifficulty since 2001. The SOR alleged 21 delinquent accounts, an approximate total \nbalance of $63,143. \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. He did not start to resolve his \ndelinquent debt until this year. He did not dispute his delinquent accounts with the credit \nreporting agencies until October 2008, three months after the SOR was issued. While \nhe successfully disputed seven of the accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.l - 1,n) and \npaid six medical accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p \u2013 1.u), totaling $1,073. Eight delinquent \naccounts remain unresolved with a total approximate balance of $21,109. Applicant \nprovided no evidence that he is paying on any of these accounts.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s several \nperiods of unemployment from 2001 to 2005. However, he has been continuously \nemployed since October 2005, and did not begin to resolve his financial situation until \nrecently. For this reason, this mitigating condition is given less weight.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. It would be \nhelpful for him to do so in order to develop a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the medical debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p \u2013 1.u. However, a significant amount of his delinquent debt remains \nunresolved and he has not developed a plan to resolve his remaining delinquent \naccounts. He recently began to resolve his delinquent accounts. It is too soon to \nconclude that he made a good-faith effort to resolve his accounts.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) applies with respect SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n. Applicant provided \nsufficient documentary evidence to support that these debts were not his responsibility.  \nHe did not provide sufficient evidence to support his disputes with the remaining \nunresolved debts alleged in the SOR.  \n \nWhile Applicant has made some progress, he has not mitigated the concerns \nraised under Guideline F.    \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his  \nfinancial delinquencies in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on his security \nclearance application, dated February 9, 2007.  \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his judgments and \ndelinquent accounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant \ndid not deliberately intend to falsify his security clearance application. Applicant claims \nthat he did not remember all of his financial delinquencies. I find his explanation \ncredible.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern is found for Applicant.  \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant has taken steps \ntowards resolving his delinquent accounts, it is too soon to conclude that his financial \nissues have been resolved due to the significant amount of his unresolved delinquent \ndebt. Applicant presented no plan as to how he intends to resolve these accounts. He \ndid not mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. Personal conduct \nconcerns are mitigated because Applicant did not intend to falsify his security clearance \napplication. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 10, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 5). On \nMay 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified \n \n1Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 23, 2008). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nOctober 15, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nand revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 30, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated July 28, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant did not provide additional documents within the 30 \ndays. On October 10, 2008, the case was assigned to me.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j (Item 4). His admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old.4 He has worked for a federal contractor since April \n2003 in the area of information technology. He married in 1994 and divorced in 2003. \nHe was previously married from 1982 until 1987. His three children or stepchildren were \nborn in 1985, 1992 and 1994. He is currently divorced. He has not served in the military. \nHe has about two years of college. In the last seven years he has not been fired, quit or \nleft employment under unfavorable circumstances. He has no police record, except for a \n1987 incident involving driving under the influence of alcohol, which resulted in \nprobation. He has not used or trafficked in illegal drugs in the last seven years, and has \nnever used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position. \n  \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR lists ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,000: \u00b6 1.a ($190), \n\u00b6 1.b ($1,256), \u00b6 1.c ($387), \u00b6 1.d ($7,674), \u00b6 1.e ($6,189), \u00b6 1.f ($405), \u00b6 1.g ($3,091), \n\u00b6 1.h ($2,174), \u00b6 1.i ($90) and \u00b6 1.j ($910). As indicated previously, he admitted all of \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated July 28, 2008, and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated August 15, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant \nthat he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n4Item 5 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n                                           \nthe SOR debts, and did not explain how these debts became delinquent or describe any \nefforts to repay his creditors.  His credit reports show several debts for over $1,000 \nbecame delinquent in mid-2005 (Items 6 and 7).     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \n5 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports and in his SOR \nresponse. He has ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,000. Several large \ndebts became delinquent in 2004 and remain delinquent today. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                           \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. He \nhas not described any actions to resolve his delinquent debts. Because there are ten \ndelinquent debts, the financial problems are not isolated. The ongoing nature of the ten \ndelinquent debts for about $22,000 debt is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). There is no evidence \nsupporting a conclusion that his debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d Moreover, his delinquent debts do cast doubt on his \u201ccurrent reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 20(b), he did not show his delinquent \ndebts were \u201clargely beyond his control.\u201d He did not establish that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.7  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant did not provide evidence of \nfinancial counseling. Moreover, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant \nshowed good faith8 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. \n \n7\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n8The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to mitigate any debts because Applicant did not \ndispute any debts. He did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute\u201d with respect to any delinquent SOR debts.   \n \nApplicant did not provide correspondence with his creditors to establish he acted \nresponsibly and in good faith from 2004 up to the present. He should have been more \ndiligent and made greater efforts to resolve his delinquent debt, especially after receipt \nof the SOR. His overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not carried his burden of proving his \nfinancial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I \nconclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nThere is some mitigating evidence under the whole person concept. Applicant\u2019s \nrecord of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence of any security \nviolation. Aside from the delinquent SOR debt (which is a civil, non-criminal issue) and a \nDUI in 1987, he is a law-abiding citizen. He does not have any record of involvement \nwith illegal drugs. His other debts are current. The overall amount of his current \n \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n7 \n \ndelinquent debt at about $22,000 is relatively low. He attended college for about two \nyears. His credit reports shows that he has paid numerous debts over the years. These \nfactors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nThere is substantial evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. From 2004 \nto present, he has ten delinquent SOR debts totalling about $22,000. He did not explain \nhow or why the debts became delinquent. He did not promise to pay or otherwise \nresolve his delinquent debts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nand all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Savarino, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I grant\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 19, 2007.\nOn October 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F, E and J.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR, answered it writing through counsel on November\n11, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the\nMarch 9, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (Feb. 18, 2009), concurring and\ndissenting, in part, opinion.\nResponse to SOR.\n2\nGE 1; GE 3 at 42-48.\n3\nAE A; Tr. 35-40.\n4\n2\nrequest on November 12, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nNovember 14, 2008, and I received the case assignment on December 2, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on December 9, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on January 12, 2009. The government offered ten exhibits (GE) 1 through\n10, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf. He submitted 13 exhibits (AE) A through M, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record\nopen until January 21, 2009, to submit additional matters.  Applicant timely submitted\nthe additional information, which has been marked as AE N, and admitted without\nobjection. The record closed on January 21, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 21, 2008, Applicant denied the factual\nallegations in the SOR, with explanations.  He also provided additional information to\n1\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  2\nApplicant, who is 26 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\na security analyst.

His mother opened a joint checking account in his\nname and his brother \u201cI\u201ds name. Applicant and his brother had access to the money in\nthe account. The bank in which this checking account had been opened was in State A,\nwhere Applicant and his brother lived.

He\ngraduated from high school in June 2001.4\n\nGE 5, attachments; GE 9 (court docket sheets); AE A; Tr. 36-42, 44. \n5\nGE 5, attachments; GE 9; GE 10 (State statute).\n6\n3\nWhile living in State A, Applicant routinely cashed checks at a local store. In\nSeptember 2000, he wrote three checks, which the store cashed. Shortly thereafter, he\nmoved to State B. He did not return to State A until February 2001 to attend his\nmother\u2019s funeral, which was February 11, 2001. When he returned, a relative told him\nthat the store was looking for him. On February 12, 2001, he contacted the store and\nlearned that his three checks had been returned by the bank for insufficient funds, as\nwere three other checks he does not recall writing. He did not know that the checks had\nbeen returned by the bank, but realizes that without telling him, his brother wrote checks\nwhich depleted the account funds. He next contacted his bank and verified that the\nchecks had been returned for insufficient funds. After verifying the nonpayment,\nApplicant paid the store $900 in cash, which repaid the $400 in check overdrafts plus\npenalties. He did not contest the amount; he paid it. He then returned to State B. He\nnever appeared in court to answer for criminal charges. He closed the checking account\nin 2001.5\nThe court docket sheets from State A for six misdemeanor simple worthless\ncheck charges indicate that Applicant was served with a summons on February 12,\n2001, that each case had a disposition (conclusion) date of February 13, 2001, and that\neach case had a court filing date of February 14, 2001. Three cases were scheduled for\ntrial on February 23, 2001 and three cases were scheduled for trial on March 21, 2001.\nThe court records show that the debt was paid in each case as of February 13, 2001.\nThe applicable statute in State A sets forth the procedures a complaining party must\nfollow to prepare a case for worthless check case. The statute also allows each district\nwithin the State A to establish a program for collection in worthless check cases. If\napproved by the Administrative Office of the Courts, the program allowed the prosecutor\nto set up criteria for these cases, and if the check passer participated by making\nrestitution of all fees and charges, the prosecutor would not prosecute the case. State\nstatute \u00a714-107.2.  \n6\nThe time lines on the court docket sheet supports Applicant\u2019s testimony that he\ndid not appear in court on these charges. The disposition date is one day before the\nfiling date of the case. In three cases, the disposition date is 10 days before the\nscheduled hearing date and in three cases, the disposition date was 36 days before the\nscheduled hearing date. The docket sheet does not show any other court appearance\ndate. Based on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he did not appear in court and the\ntime lines in the court docket sheet, I find that he did not appear in court. I also find that\nhe paid the debts under the collection program established by the prosecutor in the\ndistrict in which he lived. While the specifics of the collection program are not of record,\nthe court docket sheet dates clearly show that the checks were paid on February 13,\n2001 before the case was filed and a court date set. The only explanation for this is that\n\nId.; Tr. 45-47, 80-84. My interpretation of the court docket sheet is based on my many years of experience\n7\nreading court docket sheets in private practice.\nAE C; AE N; Tr. 60-61, 90-94.\n8\n4\nApplicant paid the debt to the store as he testified and the store notified the prosecutor,\nwho created the court record under their collection program.7\nIn July 2007, Applicant met with a security clearance investigator. For the first\ntime, he learned about unpaid debts on his credit report and about a criminal record\nrelated to the checks written in 2000. After his meeting with the investigator, Applicant\npulled his credit report. The credit report dated July 27, 2007 contains the notation\n\u201cfraud victim \u2018initial alert\u2019. Verify identity of consumer before granting credit\u201d on the first\npage. The credit report shows that this was the initial security alert. Because he could\nnot understand the information contained in his credit report, Applicant hired a credit\nreporting agency in August 2007. He made at least one payment to this agency as he\ninitially thought he owed the debts. As he began to research the debts listed on his\ncredit report, he realized he did not owe the debts and cancelled his contract with the\ncredit counseling agency in October 2007. Over the next months, Applicant filed\nchallenges to various debts listed on his credit report. In October 2007, he contacted the\npolice about filing an identity theft report, but the police officer to whom he spoke\ndeclined to take a report saying that the police did not take reports of this type and\nrecommending that Applicant contact the credit reporting companies. \nIn July 2008, Applicant again contacted the police about filing an identify theft\nreport. He received different information this time. On July 24, 2008, he personally filed\nan identity theft incident, not theft, report with the local police where he lived. He listed\nthree accounts in the report: the car loan and two credit cards. On October 24, 2008, he\nfiled a continuation report with the local police, listing four more debts including a\ntelephone debt, a car insurance debt, and two bank card debts.8\nThe SOR identifies five unpaid debts, including a car loan for $12,884, a credit\ncard debt for $360, a credit card debt for $256, a telephone debt for $120, and an\ninsurance debt for $358, which are listed on the July 27, 2007 credit report. On\nSeptember 21, 2007, Applicant filed an on-line challenge to the car insurance debt and\ntwo credit card debts, one of which is not listed as an issue in the SOR. The credit\nreport dated July 25, 2008 shows that Applicant challenged one address and nine\naccounts on his credit report. Both credit reporting companies investigated his\nchallenges to these accounts and after investigation, the companies deleted eleven of\nthe twelve accounts and the incorrect address. The one account not deleted is not at\nissue in this case. All the debts listed in the SOR are not listed in the more recent credit\nreports. Four of the five SOR debts were verified as deleted following an investigation\nby the credit reporting companies. The only deleted debt not verified as incorrect is the\ninsurance debt of $358. However, in light of Applicant\u2019s challenge to this debt and the\nabsence of this debt from the more recent credit reports, I find it is reasonable to infer\nthat the credit reporting companies deleted this debt because of his challenge and\n\nSOR; GE 3 (Attachment - Credit report, dated May 13, 2008); GE 6 (Credit report dated July 27, 2007); GE\n9\n7 (Credit report, dated June 6, 2008); AE I; AE J; AE K; AE L; AE M (Credit report, dated December 12, 2008);\nAE N at 3-4; Tr. 64-76.\nGE 3; GE 6; GE 7; AE M; Tr. 77-78, 84.\n10\nGE 1, at 1, 10-11.\n11\nTr. 80-84.\n12\n5\nsubsequent to their investigations. The fraud alert continues on his credit reports.\nApplicant has shown he does not owe the debts listed in the SOR.9\nApplicant is engaged to be married. He earns $63,000 a year and his fiancee, a\nteacher, earns more than $30,000 a year. He has a mortgage and a car payment. He is\ncurrent on his bills. With the exception of the check issues in 2000, Applicant has never\nbounced a check or overdrawn his checking account.10\nOn July 19, 2007, Applicant completed his security clearance application. He\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the following question in his e-QIP:11\nSection 23. Your Police Record f. In the last 7 years, have you been\narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in\nresponse to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than\n$150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d\nApplicant first learned that he had a criminal record when he met with the\nsecurity investigator after completing his e-QIP. He never appeared in court for the\ncheck issues in 2001 and never received a court summons. He had no contact with the\ncourt in State A until after meeting with the security investigator.  \n12\nIn March 2007, he started working for a government contractor as a security\nanalyst for public trust forms. He submitted his written resignation on July 23, 2007,\neffective July 27, 2007. His employer did not evaluate him during these four months. He\nsubmitted his resignation to the site supervisor, who died in December 2008, and the\nDirector of Human Resources. He offered his assistance during his transition. He did\nnot have performance issues at this job to his knowledge. His work assignment\naveraged 500 cases. When he resigned, his supervisor transferred his remaining 300\ncases to a federal employee performing the same work as he. In response to an\ninvestigative request, this federal employee, who was not his supervisor, stated that\nApplicant left his job with cases undone and that he did not complete his work in a\ntimely manner. A co-worker submitted an affidavit indicating that the federal employee\nwas not a supervisor, but a co-worker who was unhappy about receiving Applicant\u2019s\ncases after his departure. I find that the individual completing the investigative form was\n\nGE 8; AE F; Tr. 49-56.\n13\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n14\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\n6\nnot Applicant\u2019s supervisor and lacked authority to provide information on his work\nperformance. Applicant has never been fired from a job.  \n13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n14\n\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should\u201cnot . . give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations.

This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\nISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd., October 26, 2006).\n15\n8\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The credit report submitted by the government constitutes prima\nfacie evidence that Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\nsome obligations for a period of time.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these\n15\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nSOR debts occurred because someone opened accounts in his name without his\nknowledge. Except for the debts created by an unknown party who used Applicant\u2019s\nidentity, Applicant has managed his finances appropriately. He acts responsibility about\nhis debts as shown by the credit reports, his challenges to unknown debts and his\ndecision in 2001 to repay debts created by his brother\u2019s actions. His conduct in regard\nto his finances does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose because an unknown individual stole his identity\nand used his identity to purchase goods on credit. When he learned about his stolen\nidentify, he immediately contacted the credit reporting agencies and requested a fraud\nalert be placed on his report. He also contacted his creditors, filed challenges with the\n\nApplicant resolved the debts identified as legitimate.\n16\n9\ncredit reporting agencies, and contacted the police. His actions were very responsible\nunder the circumstances.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant hired a credit counseling agency to\nexplain to him the information contained in his credit report. Once he understood what\nwas occurring with his credit and realized he could resolve the problem on his own, he\ndeclined any further services from the credit counseling service. I conclude this\npotentially mitigating condition has some applicability. AG & 20(d) does not apply as the\nevidence does not show Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d listed in the SOR.\nApplicant challenged all the debts listed in his credit report which were not his.\nThe credit reporting agencies investigated his challenges and deleted most of the debts\nas not belonging to him. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue\u201d applies.  AG \u00b6 20(f) is not applicable in this case.\n16\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from his e-QIP when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 23f about the worthless checks written in 2000. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n17\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nIntention is defined as \u201ca determination to act in a certain way\u201d and intentional is defined as\u201d done by\n18\nintention or design\u201d. Merriam-W ebster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (11  ed. 2003).\nth\nEven if I were to find the government had established disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a), mitigating condition\n19\nAG 18(f), the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability would apply as the\nallegation of intentional falsification was unsubstantiated.\n10\nclearance and to his honesty. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his\nanswers. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden\nof proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the\nomission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that\n17\nApplicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answers was deliberate and\nintentional.18\nApplicant did not intentionally falsify his answer to Question 23f because he did\nnot know that he had a criminal record related to the checks written when he was 17\nyears old. Applicant credibly testified that he never appeared in court to answer for\ncriminal charges for writing worthless checks. His testimony is supported by the court\ndocket sheets which reflect that the checks were paid and the disposition date was one\nday before the cases were actually filed. Given that State law allows a prosecutor to\ndevelop a collection program for worthless checks, Applicant\u2019s testimony that he\nreimbursed the store for the money lost and costs is credible. Applicant\u2019s failure to list\nhis criminal record was not deliberate and intentional as he was unaware that he had a\nrecord.19\nThe SOR identifies information about Applicant\u2019s work performance as a security\nconcern. The information comes from a disgruntled co-worker, not his employer. In\naddition, the information does not raise questions about Applicant\u2019s honesty,\ntrustworthiness, or reliability to protect classified information. Applicant denied any\nproblems in this job and the record lacks information about what workplace rules he\nviolated while performing his duties. His employer did not evaluate his performance\nduring the four months he worked. Displeasure from a co-worker is irrelevant to an\napplicant\u2019s security worthiness.  Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to criminal conduct: ACriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.@\n\n11\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns. Paragraph 31(a) provides that Aa single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses@ may be disqualifying. Although Applicant was unaware of the criminal charges\nin State A, he admits he wrote three checks that were returned for insufficient funds and\nthat he reimbursed the store for the monies lost. This information combined with the\ncourt records is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition.\nThe adjudicative guidelines also set out some potentially mitigating conditions.\nUnder AG \u00b6 32(a), disqualifying conduct may be mitigated where Aso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt upon the individual=s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Under AG \u00b6 32(d), mitigation may be\nestablished where Athere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.@ The worthless checking writing incident occurred in\nSeptember 2000, more than 8 years ago. He and his brother had access to the same\nchecking account. Unbeknownst to him, his brother wrote checks for all the funds in the\naccount, not just his share of the funds. His brother\u2019s failure to inform Applicant of these\nactions directly caused Applicant\u2019s checks to be returned by the bank. When he learned\nof the problem, Applicant immediately made restitution to the store and then closed the\naccount. Applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation. He has not been involved with the\npolice for any reason since this incident. He has not been involved with drugs or other\nillegal activities. He honorably served in the Navy and works regularly. The evidence\nraises these mitigating conditions.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both good\n\n12\nand bad. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record, not\na single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is shown. A determination of\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for\nspecific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of\nrecord to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security\nconcern.     \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nproblems first began when he was a young man, still in high school. (See AG & 2(a)(4).)\nHis brother depleted the funds from their joint checking account without telling him,\ncausing Applicant to write worthless checks. When he learned about the problem at his\nmother\u2019s funeral a few months later, Applicant immediately paid the store for its losses\nafter verifying that the checks had been returned for insufficient funds. At the young age\nof 17, Applicant accepted responsibility for this problem. Since this time, Applicant\ngraduated from high school and served in the Navy with honor. He has acted honestly\nand with integrity in all that he does.\nWhen he met with the security investigator, Applicant learned that he had credit\nproblems. He immediately contacted the credit reporting agencies to report a possible\ntheft of his identity. He hired a credit counseling agency to help him with reading and\ninterpreting the information on his credit report. When it became clear to him that his\nidentity had been stolen, he notified the credit reporting companies and attempted to file\na police report. He challenged the unknown debts on his credit report. After\ninvestigation, the credit reporting agencies deleted most of the debts as not his. He\nresolved the two debts which were determined to be his. He pays his bills timely and\nlives well within his financial means. He will marry soon. He bought a house recently. He\nis a responsible young man who has resolved all the debt issues which are of concern\nto the government. He did not lie when he completed his e-QIP, as he was unaware that\nwhen he repaid the store, the local prosecutor would create a criminal record paper trail.\nBecause it has been eight years since the check incident, he cannot be improperly\npressured or placed under duress for this conduct. Of course, the issue is whether all\nhis past conduct and finances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance. After weighing all the evidence of record, I conclude that the conduct raised\nin the SOR is insufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations, personal conduct and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n13\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where she has worked for more than a year as a customer service representative. She is a single mother of a 3-year-old daughter. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted to all of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, describing seven delinquent debts totaling $13,254. Four of these debts, totaling $11,382, involved student loans. Those admissions are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant took out the student loans to pay costs associated with earning her Associate\u2019s degree from a business college while also working to support herself after high school. Shortly after earning her degree, she experienced an unplanned pregnancy and had to stop working for almost a year after her daughter was born. She then started working again, but had to leave that job after a year due to missing work to care for her daughter. She began her present job in January 2008. She has a good child-care arrangement now, and has been very successful at work, earning two promotions and anticipating another one in the near future.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has four delinquent student loans and three other small delinquent\ndebts resulting from about a year of unemployment. She is following a loan\nrehabilitation repayment agreement, will pay the other debts from her tax refund, and is\nliving within her means. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P), on January\n22, 2008. On August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense Regulation\n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation);\nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApril 16, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 20, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on September 8, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel requested a hearing pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.7, on December 11, 2008, and was ready to proceed on December 17,\n2008. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 18, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 19, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on January 9, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were also\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January\n26, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where she has\nworked for more than a year as a customer service representative. She is a single\nmother of a 3-year-old daughter. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted to all of the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, describing seven delinquent debts totaling\n$13,254. Four of these debts, totaling $11,382, involved student loans. Those\nadmissions are incorporated in the following findings. \nApplicant took out the student loans to pay costs associated with earning her\nAssociate\u2019s degree from a business college while also working to support herself after\nhigh school. Shortly after earning her degree, she experienced an unplanned pregnancy\nand had to stop working for almost a year after her daughter was born. She then started\nworking again, but had to leave that job after a year due to missing work to care for her\ndaughter. She began her present job in January 2008. She has a good child-care\narrangement now, and has been very successful at work, earning two promotions and\nanticipating another one in the near future. She is engaged to marry the father of her\ndaughter, and he provides some assistance toward paying their $400 per month in\nchild-care expenses. (Tr. at 35-38, 46-47, 53-55.)\nIn November 2007, around the time she lost her last job, Applicant and her\ndaughter moved into a bedroom that she rents for $400 per month from her fiance\u2019s\nmother in order to reduce living expenses. Other than the four student loans, Applicant\u2019s\nonly delinquent debts are two relatively small cell phone bills dating from May 2005\n($165) and July 2006 ($321), and a $1,386 debt to a jewelry store. This latter loan was\nfor her engagement ring, and was charged off by the creditor in August 2006, toward\nthe end of her year-long unemployment period. She was unaware of the residual\ntelephone debts until asked about them in connection with her security investigation.\nShe has confirmed owing these debts, and her intention is to repay them upon receipt of\nher income tax refund. (GE 1 at 1, 2; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 4; Tr. at 36-39.)\nApplicant entered a student loan rehabilitation agreement with the company\nassigned to collect those loans in August 2008. Under the agreement, she has been\n\n3\npaying $170 per month via direct debits from her bank account, and the loans will return\nto current status in June 2009. She also purchased a used car in July 2008, and will\nfinish paying off that purchase loan with her April 2009 monthly $306 payment. She\npays $91 per month in auto insurance. Her net take-home pay is $900 every two weeks,\nwhich averages $1,950 per month.  Deducting her rent, child-care, car loan, insurance\ncosts, and loan rehabilitation payments leaves her with about $590 for food, clothing,\ngas, utilities, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. She is able to live without\nincurring further debt on this budget, and is on track to repay her existing debts. (AE C;\nGE 6 at 2; GE 3 at 7; Tr. at 41-44, 50-51.)\n \nApplicant testified credibly and convincingly that she never intends to incur\ndelinquent debt again, and will continue the responsible budgeting and spending pattern\nshe has followed over the past year and a half. Her excellent performance at work has\ndemonstrated her integrity and trustworthiness around sensitive information. She also\nhighly values her present employment opportunity, is very aware of security issues and\nrequirements, and understands that future financial responsibility will be required. (AE\nA; AE B; Tr. at 27, 31-32, 43-44.)  \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this\norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified\nor sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence raised three of these\npotentially disqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(b)\n\n5\nindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any\nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d There was neither any\nallegation nor proof of compulsive, addictive, or problem gambling. Nor was there any\nevidence of drug abuse, alcoholism, tax evasion, or illegal financial practices. \nApplicant went through two periods, totaling about a year during her daughter\u2019s\ninfancy, when she was out of work in order to care for her. As a result, she was unable\nto remain current on her student loan payments, and also fell behind on three other bills\ntotaling $1,872. She changed her living arrangements to minimize expenses and ensure\nthat her income could cover those expenses going forward.  She has always been\nwilling and intended to satisfy her debts, but was temporarily unable to do so because of\nsome unemployment. When she resumed working, her income was sufficient to avoid\nnew debts but too low to afford substantial debt repayments. She has since followed an\nagreed program with her student loan creditor to bring those loans back into current\nstatus by May 2009, and will repay the three small debts out of her income tax refund.\nAG \u00b6 19(a) no longer applies to Applicant, leaving only potential concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(b) or (c). There is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending, and she\ndemonstrated her intent to repay existing debts, so AG \u00b6 19(b) was not established.\nOnly if her history of not meeting financial obligations indicates current poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations should that history\nsupport present security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c). Since the circumstances giving\nrise to those debts no longer exist, and she has arranged to resolve them, such\nconcerns are minimal.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a\nhistory of unpaid debt. Since Applicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any SOR-listed\ndebt, the four potentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose relatively recently, but were the result of her\nunemployment following an unplanned pregnancy. Her daughter is now old enough to\nbe doing well in child-care, and Applicant\u2019s performance in her current employment has\nbeen excellent for over a year. She has taken all possible measures to minimize her\nregular living expenses and maintained gainful employment to remain self-supporting.\nShe has been making regular payments under her student loan rehabilitation agreement\nsince August 2008, and those loans will return to current status in a few months. These\nactions by Applicant establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a), since the debts arose under\ncircumstances that have changed, and are unlikely to recur. She has incurred no newly\ndelinquent debt for several years, reflecting her good judgment and trustworthiness. \nApplicant had to stop working for almost a year after becoming a mother, and fell\nbehind on non-essential expenses. She resumed work as soon as she could, and has\narranged to resolve her delinquent debts. She accordingly established mitigation under\nAG \u00b6 20(b). She has regularly made student loan rehabilitation payments under an\nagreement with the creditor, and will pay off her other three delinquent debts with her\nincome tax refund. This establishes substantial additional mitigation and resolves\nremaining security concern under AG \u00b6 20(d). \nAs the Appeal Board recently ruled:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves her delinquent student loans and three other relatively small debts for\nwhich she accepted responsibility. She made difficult but mature and responsible\nchoices to resume working and change her living arrangements to remain within her\nmeans while recovering from her temporary unemployment. \nApplicant has reasonable and achievable plans to resolve these debts in the near\nfuture. There is little likelihood of recurrence of this problem, based on her actions to\nminimize living expenses and arrange repayment of her current delinquencies. She has\nalleviated the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress from her financial\nsituation by arranging repayment. Her enthusiastic desire to maintain eligibility for her\npresent job provides very strong motivation for continued responsibility.\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness concerns arising from her failure to satisfy some of her debts, and\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. Overall, the record evidence leaves no\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all\nthese reasons, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to ADP I/II/III sensitive information is granted.   \n  \n \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns for financial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 22, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 29, 2008.  She admitted 12 \nand denied three allegations under Guideline F.  She requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 22, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on January 2, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on January 8, 2009, for a hearing on February 5, 2009.  I convened the hearing \nas scheduled.  The government offered four exhibits, marked Government Exhibits \n1 \n \nFebruary 27, 2009\n\n2 \n \n(Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.  Applicant submitted \nthree exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through C, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf.  The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant did timely submitted seven \ndocuments, marked App. Ex. D through J.  Department Counsel had no objection to \nconsideration of the documents (Gov. Ex. 5, Memorandum, dated February 20, 2009), \nand the documents are admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nFebruary 19, 2009.  Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old customer service representative for a defense \ncontractor.  Applicant was one of five children raised by a single mother.  She had her \nfirst child while she was still in high school.  She was married in December 2004 but \nseparated in April 2005.  She now has three children, ages 15, 11, and five.  All of the \nchildren have different fathers.  She receives sporadic support for the children from the \nfathers.  The five year old child has disabilities.  At present she receives $674 in \ndisability payments for the child.  The amount will be reduced in the next month to $537 \nmonthly (Tr. 15-16: Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated February \n1, 2007).  \n \n \nApplicant is paid hourly at the rate of $10.12 by her employer.  She does not \nreceive overtime.  Her monthly net salary is $1,280.  Her total monthly income, including \nthe disability payment, is approximately $1,800.  Applicant's monthly recurring expenses \nare about $1,400, including $100 a month in after school child care expenses.  She also \ntithes to her church.  She has about $200 left each month in discretionary income.  \nApplicant used her tax refund and stimulus check last year to pay some of her debts \nand make current some other debts that were past due.  She stated she made some \npurchases, like a cell phone, satellite television service, and a car that was \nrepossessed, that she should not have made.  Applicant does not have or use credit \ncards.  She had periods of unemployment caused by being laid-off, and injuries.  In \naddition to regular employment with the defense contractor, Applicant is the volunteer \nsecretary and a Sunday school teacher for her church (Tr. 18-33). \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated May 25, 2007; Gov. Ex. 3, dated April 7, 2008) \nshow that Applicant has the following 15 delinquent debts: a car repossession debt of \n$14,166 in collection (SOR 1.a); nine medical debts of various amounts ranging from $5 \nto $412 (SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o); a debt of $34,170.33 in collection \nfor a mobile home (SOR 1.d); a cell phone debt of $625 in collection (SOR 1.e); two \ndebts of $345 each in collection for cash advances (SOR 1.i and 1.j); and a debt of \n$225 in collection for satellite television service (SOR 1.n).   \n \n \nApplicant purchased the car listed as repossessed in SOR 1.a in April 2001 for \napproximately $17,000, and it was repossessed in September 2002.  Since the \nrepossession, Applicant has not made any payments on the debt.  She acknowledges \nthe debt but disputes the amount of the debt as too high.  She has been in contact with \n\n3 \n \nthe creditor and they are requesting $11,000 to settle the debt.  She is not able to make \nany payments to settle the debt (Tr. 33-34, 47-48).   \n \n \nThere are nine medical debts listed, all in collection by the same collection \ncompany.  Applicant did not have health insurance until she started working for her \npresent defense contractor employer.  Most of her medical debts are for co-payments \nrequired when she or her children received medical care.  Applicant provided \ndocumentation that she paid three of the debts listed at SOR 1.b, 1.c, and 1.m (Tr. 35-\n37; App. Ex. A, Receipt, dated January 26, 2009).  The medical debt at SOR 1.f was \nsettled and paid on February 13, 2009 (App. Ex. D, Letter, dated February 19, 2009).  \nThe debts listed at SOR 1.g and 1.k both for $155 are duplicates as acknowledged by \nthe collection agency.  Applicant has scheduled this account for payment on February \n27, 2009.  Applicant has scheduled a payment of $283 for the debt at SOR 1.h for \nMarch 13, 2009, and the debt for $412 at SOR 1.l for payment on March 27, 2009.  The \ncollection agency has no record of the $47 debt listed at SOR 1.o.  Applicant intends to \npay approximately $100 from each biweekly paycheck until the medical debts are \nsettled and paid (TR. 37-38).   \n \n \nApplicant purchased a mobile home in September 2002.  Prior to the dealer \nplacing it on her land, Applicant cancelled the contract because she found another \nhouse at a better deal.  The dealer brought the mobile home to the lot anyway and left \nit.  It was never assembled or completed, and Applicant never lived in it.  The dealer \nfinally took it from the lot.  Applicant did not know of any debt until she received the \nSOR.  After the hearing, Applicant contacted the credit bureau to dispute the debt.  It is \nlisted on one credit report but not on another credit report.  She is working with the \ncredit reporting agency to have the debt removed from her credit report (Tr. 38; App. Ex. \nD, Applicant's Letter, date February 19, 2009, at 2). \n \n \nThe cell phone debt for $625 at SOR 1.e was settled for $151 and paid (Tr. 38, \nApp. Ex. B, Letter, dated October 16, 2008, check, dated January 27,2009; App. Ex. J, \nPayment letter, dated February 6, 2009).  Applicant has reached an agreement to settle \nthe two cash advance accounts of $345 each for $120.75 per debt.  She made the first \npayment on February 13, 2009, and the remaining balance is scheduled for payment on \nMarch 6, 2009 (App. Ex. D, Letter, dated February 19, 2009 at 2; App. Ex. I, Letter, \ndated February 6, 2009).  Applicant does not believe she has any obligation for a \nsatellite television service.  She believes she paid all of her bills for the service.  She \ninquired about the debt, but the company has no record of an account for Applicant with \nthem. She called the collection agency listed on the credit report but she did not receive \nan answer (App. Ex. D, Letter, February 19, 2009, at 1-2). \n \n \nApplicant made a payment of $112 on February 3, 2009 towards a medical debt \nnot listed on the SOR.  The balance on this debt is $2,656.82 (App. Ex. G, Letter, dated \nFebruary 13, 2009; App. Ex. H, Receipt, dated February 13, 2009).  Applicant also \nmade payments of $40.61 in partial payment of a telephone debt on January 27, 2009; \n$594.67 to a finance company to settle a personal loan on January 24, 2009; and \n$556.28 to settle a personal loan on January 23, 2009.  Applicant's intention was to pay \n\n4 \n \nthese debts even though not listed as delinquent on the SOR to clear them so she can \nconcentrate on her past due debts (Tr. 42-45; App. Ex. C, Receipts, various dates).  \n \n \nApplicant evaluation from her employer for the initial period of her employment \nwas an average evaluation with some need for improvement (App. Ex. E, Letter, dated \nFebruary 17, 2009).  Applicant's pastor, who hired her to be the church secretary, stated \nthat Applicant is dependable and does a good job.  In addition to working as the \nsecretary, she also teaches Sunday school.  She works on various committees in \nsupport of the church.  She is trustworthy and reliable (App. Ex. F, Letter, undated). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n5 \n \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a security concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from car and mobile home repossessions, \nmedical debts, loans, and telephone bills, as established by credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, are a security concern raising Financial Consideration \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and \nFC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not meeting financial obligations\".   \n \n \nI have considered a number of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \n(FC MC).  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) \"the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" does not apply.  \nWhile the debts were incurred some time ago, they have either just been paid or are still \nunpaid and thus considered current.  There are a number of different accounts and \ndebts, so Applicant incurred debt frequently.  Although Applicant incurred some debts \nwhen she was young and a single mother with three children and no support from the \n\n6 \n \nfathers, she has not established that the delinquent debts were incurred under unusual \ncircumstances.  In fact, she admits that she should not have made some purchases.   \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\"  It partially applies.  Applicant \nhas three children but receives only sporadic child support form the fathers.  If she \nreceived adequate and continuous child support, she could provide for the children and \nnot have as much debt to repay.  In addition, some of the debts resulted from periods of \nunemployment.  Applicant is acting responsibly since she is not using credit cads and is \ntrying to repay her past due obligations.  \n \n \nI have not considered FC MC \u00b6 20(a) \"the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\"  Applicant presented no information concerning financial \ncounseling.   \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) 'the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\"  Applicant has paid five of the \nnine medical debts listed in the SOR and has a payment plan and is paying another \nthree debts.  Two of the listed debts are duplicates.  She paid one of the two pay-day-\nloans and has a plan to pay the other pay-day-loan.  She presented sufficient \ninformation to show payment of the debt for telephone service.  Applicant inquired about \ntwo debts listed on the credit reports and in the SOR, but was unable to obtain payment \ninformation.  She has a legitimate dispute and is now disputing her largest debt for a \nmobile home.  The only debt she has not taken action on pertains to a car \nrepossession.  She acknowledges the debt but disputes the amount.  She presented \ninformation to show payment of other debts not listed on the credit reports or in the \nSOR.  In spite of not taking any action on the repossessed care debt, Applicant \npresented sufficient information to show she is making as good an effort as she can \nunder her circumstances to resolve past due obligations.  While she has outstanding \ndelinquent debts, she is making an effort to pay or other wise resolve her debts.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n7 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  An applicant can shown a \n\"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including evidence of actual debt reduction \nthrough payment of debts.  An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish \nthat she paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR.  All that is required is that \napplicant demonstrate that she has established a plan to resolve her financial problems \nand taken significant actions to implement that plan. The entirety of an applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation and her actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent \nto which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her outstanding indebtedness is \ncredible and realistic.  Available, reliable information about the person's, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.  \nThere is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously.  Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for \nthe payment of such debts one at a time.  Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the \nSOR (ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment by presenting \nsufficient information to show she is taking sufficient, consistent, reasonable, and \nresponsible action to resolve her financial issues.  She presented information to show \neither payment of medical debts or a continuing plan to pay the remainder.  She \npresented sufficient information to show payment of two other debts listed of security \nconcern.  In addition, she presented information to show payment of other debts not \nlisted as security concern.  She presented sufficient information to show payment of one \npay-day-loan and a plan to repay the remaining one.  She is disputing her largest debt \nfor a mobile home and her dispute is reasonable.  She inquired about two debts but did \nnot receive information concerning them.  Only one debt, for a car repossession has not \nbeen adequately addressed.  Applicant presented information that she is considered by \nher employer to be an average worker.  She also is a volunteer in her church and \ncontributes both financially and through her efforts as a volunteer secretary and Sunday \nschool teacher.   \n \nApplicant is taking responsible action to resolve her financial problems.  She is \npaying her past due obligations as best she can as a single mother with three children \nnot receiving child support.  She does not have credit cards and is not incurring \nadditional debt.  She has demonstrated she is managing her finances responsibly under \nthe circumstances.  The management of present finances and past obligations indicates \nshe will be concerned, responsible, and not careless concerning sensitive information.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \n\n8 \n \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She has received social and medical \nbenefits based on her French citizenship. She wants to continue to receive the benefits of \nFrench citizenship. Security concerns pertaining to foreign preference are not mitigated. \nEligibility for a U.S. security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 23, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 14, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her (GE 7) pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised; and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nNovember 5, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR \nalleges security concerns under Guideline C (foreign preference) (GE 7). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n  \nOn July 30, 2009, Applicant signed her response to the SOR and provided it to \nDOHA on August 3, 2009 (GE 8). On September 10, 2009, Department Counsel \nindicated he was ready to proceed. The case was assigned to me on September 21, \n2009.  \n \nAt the video teleconference hearing held on October 22, 2009,1 Department \nCounsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 18). There were no objections, \nand I admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 18-19). Applicant offered two exhibits (AE A, B), which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection (Tr. 20-21). Additionally, I admitted the Hearing \nNotice (GE 6), SOR (GE 7), and Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (GE 8). I received the \ntranscript on October 29, 2008.  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nAt the hearing, on my own motion I took administrative notice of some basic facts \nconcerning France, as well as about France\u2019s relationship to the United States (Tr. 38-\n41).2 I offered the parties an opportunity to object to those facts (Tr. 40-41). I did not \nreceive any objections (Tr. 40-41). The specific facts noticed are in the section of this \nopinion labeled \u201cFrench Republic.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n1 Applicant waived her right under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8 to 15-days\u2019 notice of date, time, and location \nof her hearing (Tr. 14-15). Applicant was located at an overseas location. Department Counsel and I were \nlocated in Arlington, Virginia. \n \n2Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing \ninternet sources for numerous documents). In this case the source for the facts is the U.S. Department of \nState, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs April 2009, \u201cBackground Note: France,\u201d available at \nhttp://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3842.htm (Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit (AJ Ex.) I).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c with explanations \n(GE 5). For SOR \u00b6 1.d, she admitted she had a currently valid French passport; \nhowever, she denied that she used it to travel in the European Union and noted it was \nnot necessary to use a French passport for such travel (GE 5). In regard to SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nshe admitted that she owned real property in France valued at about $230,000 (GE 5). \nHer admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old (Tr. 7, 21). In 1995, she earned a bachelor of arts \ndegree in English from a U.S. university (Tr. 7). She married her husband in 1998 (Tr. \n22). Her husband is a French citizen and lives in France (Tr. 24). For at least the last \nfive years, her husband has been a school teacher in France (Tr. 37). From 1998 to \n2008, Applicant lived in France (Tr. 24). She currently lives in a nearby European \ncountry so that she can be closer to her employment (Tr. 24). On May 10, 2004, she \nwas hired as a temporary employee at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \ninstallation (Tr. 5; AE B). On March 1, 2005, she was hired as a permanent employee at \nthe NATO installation (AE B).  \n  \nForeign Preference \n  \n \nApplicant became a French citizen in 1999 (Tr. 24; GE 3). She became a French \ncitizen so that she could receive French employment (GE 3). She needed money to pay \noff her student loans (GE 3). Over the last decade she has received the benefits of \nbeing a French citizen, such as medical benefits and other social benefits (Tr. 24). She \nreceived a French passport in 1998 (Tr. 25). Her current French passport is valid until \n2015 (Tr. 25). When she began her employment at NATO and applied for a U.S. \nsecurity clearance, she agreed not to use her French passport (Tr. 26). She recently \nturned her French passport in to the U.S. Mission to NATO, where it was destroyed (Tr. \n25; AE A).  \n \nApplicant has a checking and savings account in France (Tr. 22). She does not \nhave any bank accounts in the United States (Tr. 35). She has a French NATO security \nclearance (Tr. 8). She and her husband own property in France. The location of the \nproperty in France is due to geographical convenience rather than political or national \npreference (Tr. 28-29). If she lived in the United States, she would own property in the \nUnited States (Tr. 28-29). \n \nApplicant has voted in both United States and French elections (Tr. 36). She \nvoted in the 2008 U.S. presidential election (Tr. 36). She voted in a French election \nabout two years ago (Tr. 36).  \n \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.   \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nWhen Applicant applied for NATO employment, she had to elect her primary \ncitizenship (Tr. 30). She selected French citizenship because she received her initial \nemployment from a French temporary employment agency, and she was informed that \na French security clearance would be processed faster than a U.S. security clearance \n(Tr. 30-31). She learned she could immediately receive an interim French security \nclearance and continue her employment (Tr. 31). However, she would have to wait a \nyear for a U.S. security clearance and would not be permitted to retain her employment \nuntil the U.S. security clearance was approved (Tr. 31). She annunciated a preference \nfor France for economic reasons and not as an expression of loyalty.  \n \nApplicant does not intend to renounce her French citizenship (Tr. 26).4 She \nwanted to retain her French citizenship because it helps with employment in France. \nHer French citizenship makes it possible to receive medical services at a French \nhospital, and it provides a social and financial safety net (Tr. 27). European citizens \nreceive priority for employment, and that priority is an important factor in her decision to \nremain a French citizen (Tr. 27). Another factor is her desire to adopt the culture of her \nhusband (Tr. 28).  \n \nApplicant has been employed at a NATO installation more than five years (AE B). \nHer NATO security officer notes her conscientious treatment of classified, sensitive or \nprotected information (AE B).  \n \nApplicant wanted her employer (a subdivision of NATO) to consider her to be an \nAmerican (Tr. 32). Being considered a U.S. citizen will improve her employment \npossibilities in NATO (Tr. 33). Americans have an excellent reputation as dedicated, \nhard workers (Tr. 33). She is very proud of her American nationality (Tr. 33). She \nconsiders her preference to be American over French (Tr. 34). She has a large family in \nthe United States, and her family connections are very strong (Tr. 34). She stays in \ncontact with her American family and visits the United States whenever possible (Tr. 34, \n35). She enjoys experiencing American food and culture even while she is in Europe. \nFor example, she enjoys visiting the American facilities at the U.S. military bases in the \nKaiserslatuern area of Germany (Tr. 35). \n   \nFrench Republic5 \n \nFrance is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the G-8, the European Union, the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the World Trade Organization and various \nmultilateral organizations.  France is America\u2019s oldest ally; French military assistance \nwas instrumental in helping Britain\u2019s American colonies establish independence. More \nAmerican soldiers have been killed on French soil (because of World Wars I & II) than \non that of any other foreign country. France supports the U.S. initiative under Quartet for \n \n4 Failure to offer to renounce or to actually renounce foreign citizenship is not a negative factor \nweighing against approval of a security clearance. \n  \n5 AJ Ex. I is the source for the facts in this section. See also Administrative Notice, supra. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nresolving Middle East problems. Since 2003, France has supported four U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions in Iraq and provided funds as part of the European Union\u2014Iraq \ncontribution. Since 2006, France has joined the United States and others in actively \ndiscouraging Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons. \n \nThe U.S. State Department describes the international relationship with France \nas active and friendly.  The United States and France share common values and have \nparallel policies on most political, economic, and security issues. Differences are \ndiscussed frankly and have not generally been allowed to impair the pattern of close \ncooperation that characterizes relations between the two countries. France has \nsignificantly increased participation in NATO\u2019s military wing in recent years. France \nended conscription in 2002 and is modernizing its military forces. Although France \nopposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq, France has about 2,000 soldiers serving in \nAfghanistan, and assisted in assembling $21 billion in pledges for economic assistance \nto Afghanistan. France is a close ally of the United States in the war on terrorism. In \nDecember 2007, France convicted five former Guantanamo detainees on terrorism \ncharges.   \n \nThe United States and France have strong economic relationships with each \nother. The United States is France\u2019s sixth-ranked supplier of imports. The United States \nis the top destination for French investments worldwide. The United States is the largest \nforeign investor in France, employing over 619,000 French citizens. France is the \nUnited States\u2019 eighth trading partner for total goods.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, nothing in \nthis decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline C (foreign preference) with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 describes the foreign preference security concern stating, \u201cwhen an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country;  \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \nApplicant became a French citizen, received French social and/or medical \nbenefits, and obtained a French passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. Her voting in a \nFrench election is not a disqualifying condition because she did not receive notice about \nthis concern in the SOR. She does not currently possess a French passport. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n10(a)(3), 10(b) and 10(d) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nAG \u00b6 11(e) applies and mitigates any concern about Applicant\u2019s possession of a \nFrench passport. None of the other mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant was born \nin the United States and her parents are U.S. citizens. She became a French citizen in \n1998 or 1999 even though she was a U.S. citizen. She did not offer to renounce her \nFrench citizenship. She received French medical/social benefits as an adult after \nleaving the United States and becoming a French citizen.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nunder Guideline C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is considerable evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. \nThe foreign preference issue in this case relates to France. The French geopolitical \nsituation and France\u2019s relationship with the United States are pertinent factors in this \nanalysis.6 France\u2019s relationship with the United States has changed over the decades \nand is likely to change again in the future. France is and has been an important U.S. \nally; however, on some occasions, such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq, France has \ncontested U.S. policy. France currently has an excellent human rights record. France \nhas weapons of mass destruction, is an important trading partner, and vigorously \nsuppresses terrorism.7 The French relationship with the United States is an important \nfactor weighing towards approval of Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \nThere are other significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant has lived in the United States for most of her adult life. \nShe was born in the United States, and she was educated in the United States through \nher bachelor\u2019s degree. Her parents and siblings are U.S. citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. Applicant\u2019s deep relationship with her family living in the United States \nand her strong connections to the United States tend to mitigate security concerns. She \nis a law-abiding U.S. citizen, and there is no evidence of any performance or work-\nrelated problems. She is fully inculcated with U.S. values. I found her statements to be \nhonest, candid and credible. Her expression of preference for the United States over \nFrance is credible and given great weight.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time. Applicant became a French citizen in 1998 or 1999 even though she had \nalready held U.S. citizenship from birth in the United States. She was about 25 or 26 \nyears old when she became a French citizen. She was not a minor. Applicant currently \nhas a checking and savings account in France. She does not have any bank accounts \nin the United States. Applicant has a French NATO security clearance. When she \nbegan her NATO employment, she elected a French nationality over a U.S. nationality \nfor economic reasons. She received French medical and/or social benefits as a result of \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n7The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. France \nand the United States have been allies since the Revolutionary War. It is very unlikely that France would \nput Applicant into a position where she would be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States \nand her husband who lives in France. With its strong human rights record, and friendly political and \nmilitary relationship with the United States, it is not conceivable that France would coercively target any \nFrench citizen or former citizen living outside France in an attempt to gather valuable information from the \nUnited States. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nher French citizenship. Applicant and her husband own property in France. The location \nof her French property is due to geographical convenience rather than political or \nnational preference, and I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant has \nvoted in both United States and French elections. She voted in the 2008 U.S. \npresidential election. She voted in a French election about two years ago.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s analysis in ISCR Case No. 08-05869 (App. Board July 24, \n2009) is instructive concerning the application of mitigating factors for an applicant with \na strong foreign preference for Australia, who attempted to re-establish a preference for \nthe United States. The Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to \ngrant a security clearance for a U.S. born citizen, who moved to Australia to be with his \nwife, became an Australian citizen, served in the Australian Army as a commissioned \nofficer in an intelligence-related position, and held an Australian security clearance. Id. \nat 2. The Appeal Board cited as error the judge\u2019s interpretation of that applicant\u2019s desire \nto provide for his family as his reason for showing preference for Australia as mitigating, \nwhereas the Appeal Board considered this economic motive to be a negative \ndemonstration of personal interests taking priority over the interests of the United \nStates. Id. at 5. The Appeal Board did not find that applicant\u2019s return to the United \nStates more than ten years ago, divorce from his Australian spouse, renunciation of his \nAustralian citizenship, and surrender of his Australian passport to be sufficient to re-\nestablish his preference for the United States over Australia.   \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of her connections to France and to the \nUnited States, as well as her actions showing preference for each nation, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to carry her burden of mitigating the foreign preference security \nconcern.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude she is not eligible for a United States security clearance at \nthis time.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.e: \n For Applicant \n \n \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 26, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On August 14, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \n \n1  Item 5. \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nDecember 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn September 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated October 9, 2008, was provided to \nhim, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.3 The case was assigned to me on December 12, \n2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c. \u2013 1.d., 1.f. \u2013 \n1.h., and 1.j. \u2013 1.l.

The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had \n30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit information. \n \n4  Item 5 (e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n5 Items 7 and 8. \n \n6 Item 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s eQIP, and his November 2007 and August 2008 credit reports.7 As noted \nabove, Applicant\u2019s Answer denied he owes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.e. and \n1.i.; however, he has provided no evidence to prove or support his assertions. Even if \nApplicant\u2019s assertions are true, the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR to which he \nadmits are $12,700. \n \nThe DOHA interrogatories asked Applicant (in part) to explain and/or document \nthe status of 12 delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.m. Applicant stated in \nhis response, \u201cAs for the question list on our creditors, none of those have been paid \nand no monthly payments have been arranged at this time.\u201d8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM failed to address any of his delinquent debts. \nHe failed to provide any information as to how he acquired the debts, why they became \ndelinquent, what efforts he took, if any, to resolve his debts, and what measures he has \ntaken to avoid similar financial problems in the future. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n7 Items 7 and 8. \n \n8 Items 6. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d9 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n \n9 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n10 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response.  \n \nApplicant has submitted no documentation to show he has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.e., and l.i., that he has \nattempted to contact those or other creditors to settle or resolve the debts alleged in the \nSOR, or that he is receiving counseling or has ever received financial counseling to \nassist him with his financial difficulties.  \n \nApplicant also has not produced convincing evidence showing that he acted \nresponsibly or prudently in managing his financial affairs over several years, and it is \nclear from the record evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not recent, are \nnot isolated, and appear likely to be a continuing concern in the future.  \n \nApplicant admitted nine of twelve debts alleged and those nine debts \napproximate $12,700. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Considering the record as a whole, I conclude his 12 SOR debts, \ntotaling about $16,000 are still valid, delinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible \nfor them.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,11 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to establish \nthe applicability of any of the mitigating conditions. \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Based on his security \nclearance application, Applicant has held his present job as a contractor since January \n2006.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nhe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control \nof his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. He has not carried his \nburden of proving his financial responsibility. His overall financial behavior casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \n \n11  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment doing Government contract weighs in his favor.  \nAside from his delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a law-abiding \ncitizen. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of delinquent debt that has been ongoing. Applicant has submitted \nno documentation to show he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \ndebts, that he has attempted to contact those or other creditors to settle or resolve \ndebts alleged in the SOR, or that he is receiving or has ever received financial \ncounseling to assist him with his financial difficulties. Applicant has not produced \nconvincing evidence showing that he has acted responsibly or prudently in managing \nhis financial affairs over several years, and it is clear from the record that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are not recent isolated, and appear likely to be a continuing concern \nin the future. Accordingly, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns caused by \nthe financial considerations in his case. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 52 years old. He is divorced and has three children. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems Engineer, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. The SOR lists 3 allegations regarding financial difficulties, specifically overdue debts, under Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR: 1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $12,871. 1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,209. 1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,712. Applicant testified that these three debts were incurred by both him and his wife at the time, with whom he is now involved in divorce proceedings, as community debt. The debts for 1.a. and 1.b. were primarily for the start up of his wife\u2019s business, when they were married.

Lear, Esquire \nFebruary 17, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on August 14, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 24, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for December 11, 2008. At the request of counsel for Applicant,\nthe hearing was continued to December 15, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1\nthrough 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Exhibits A through L, which were also entered into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on December 29, 2008. I\n\n2\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December 22, 2008, to submit\nadditional matters.  He submitted Exhibit M, a letter from his attorney and a cohabitation\nagreement, that will be discussed below, dated January 12, 2009, a date clearly beyond\nthe date I granted for the record to remain open. However, since Department Counsel\nindicated that he had no objection to this letter being entered into evidence, and since\nthe late date of the letter was because of a later development, I have admitted Exhibit M\ninto evidence. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 52 years old. He is divorced and has three children. \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor as a Systems Engineer, and he\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense\nsector.\nThe SOR lists 3 allegations regarding financial difficulties, specifically overdue\ndebts, under Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the\nsame order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $12,871.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,209. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,712. \nApplicant testified that these three debts were incurred by both him and his wife\nat the time, with whom he is now involved in divorce proceedings, as community debt.\nThe debts for 1.a. and 1.b. were primarily for the start up of his wife\u2019s business, when\nthey were married.  It is his contention that both parties are responsible for resolving\nthese debts, and currently negotiations are ongoing as to how and by whom the debts\nwould be resolved.\nExhibit A is a letter from the former attorney for Applicant\u2019s ex-wife, dated August\n9, 2007, with a proposed settlement between Applicant and his ex-wife. Among the\nissues proposed and the one specifically identified by Applicant is paragraph 2, in which\nit was proposed that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife would accept and resolve all of the community\nproperty debt, identified as approximately $160,000, in lieu of her being awarded her\nmedical practice. Applicant testified that not only would this proposal resolve these\ndebts, but as a medical doctor, his ex-wife is in a position to carry out this proposal if it\n\n3\nis ultimately accepted. He introduced her Curriculum Vitae to establish her impressive\ncredentials as medical doctor (Exhibit B).\nApplicant testified that he is an electrical engineer with a bachelor\u2019s degree, to\nindicate that his earning potential is also sufficient to resolve these debts. He submitted\nhis college transcript (Exhibit C) and a copy of his diploma (Exhibit D) to establish the\ntraining that he received to become an electrical engineer.  He also introduced an\nearning statement to show that he is currently earning approximately $86,000 a year\n(Exhibit L).  Finally, Applicant testified that he owns a piece of property, and that while it\nwas not his desire, he could sell the property to pay off the overdue debts (Tr at 49-50). \nApplicant also introduced a letter from his attorney, dated July 14, 2008, with\nApplicant\u2019s proposed settlement of the community debts (Exhibit K).  \nExhibit M, the post hearing letter from Applicant\u2019s attorney, states that Applicant\nand his ex-wife have made an agreement to begin cohabiting \u201cin an effort to settle their\ncollective debts as well as to reduce their expenses.\u201d Based on this agreement the\nformer husband and wife would share a home so that they could reduce their debt to\nonly one home payment. \nApplicant introduced evidence to suggest that these debts could and would\neventually be resolved. Unfortunately, at this time none of the three debts has been\nreduced or resolved in any way. The debts are all still outstanding, and no apparent\nattempt has been made to work with the creditors to resolve these debts or make some\nkind of payment arrangements.\n \nApplicant offered into evidence three positive character letters (Exhibits E, F and\nH). He also submitted a series of pictures, drawings and other memorabilia (Exhibit H)\nto confirm how devoted he is to his children. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder Disqualifying Condition (DC) 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\nis potentially disqualifying. Similarly under DC 19 (c), a history of not meeting financial\nobligations may raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent\n\n5\ndebt and was unable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nMitigating Condition 20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, could\ninitially be argued to apply in this case. As noted above, the financial problems arose\nprimarily from Applicant\u2019s divorce. However, I can not find that Applicant has acted\nresponsibly by contacting the creditors and making any kind of attempt to resolve these\nlong overdue debts. Until such time as Applicant makes a good faith effort to resolve\nthese overdue debts, l can not find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n At this time, I can not conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial\nconcerns.\nWHOLE PERSON CONCEPT\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why DC (a) and (b) apply, and why MC (b) does not apply, I find that the\nrecord evidence leaves me with significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns until has\nmade a good faith effort to resolve his overdue debts. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 17, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 4, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 20, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on October 21, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 55 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nAs of July 2008, applicant was indebted to American Express (AE) in the\napproximate amount of $18,724.00. In response to interrogatories sent to her by DOHA,\nshe stated she had agreed to make monthly payments of $1,000.00 to the law firm\nrepresenting AE. She attached to her interrogatory responses a May 16, 2008 letter\nfrom the law firm. This letter states that the balance due is $18,273.70. Applicant also\nattached a copy of her check register which shows a $250.00 payment going to the law\nfirm on April 16, 2008 and a $1,000.00 payment going to the law firm on May 16, 2008.\nIn her response to the SOR, applicant reiterated that she is paying the law firm\n$1,000.00 per month. She attached a letter from the law firm indicating that her debt\nhad been reduced to $17,143.24.\nThe AE debt is the only debt alleged in the SOR. However, the evidence\nestablishes that applicant had fallen behind on many debts, and has since repaid them,\nor brought them current. In her response to the SOR, applicant provided some\nbackground concerning her debts. She explained:\nMy sister and I started a business in March 2006 . . .The business drained\nmy financial resource and I put some of the expenses on my credit cards,\notherwise we would have had to close the business. The business is now\nbreaking even. I did get behind on several credit card debts, but all are\nnow current or fully paid off. I am paying [the law firm collecting for\nAmerican Express] $1000 monthly payments on my outstanding balance.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n\n3\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a history of an inability to\npay her debts.  Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\nwere for the most part caused by a failing business. The business has now stabilized to\nthe point that it is breaking even. Applicant has either satisfied her delinquent debts or\nhas made arrangements to satisfy them. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are unlikely to\nrecur, and they do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by conditions largely beyond her control;\nnamely a failing business venture. She acted responsibly by repaying or agreeing to\nrepay all of her delinquent debts. Accordingly, this mitigating condition is applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. It is clear the problem is under control.\nThis mitigating condition is applicable.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has\nsatisfied all of her past-due debts or is in the process of satisfying them. This mitigating\ncondition is applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nfound herself owning a business that was failing. She decided to put some of her\nexpenses on credit cards, and then fell behind on her credit card payments. She has\nsince either repaid all of the delinquent credit card debt or has reached repayment\nagreements with her creditors. Most of these repayments occurred before the SOR was\nissued. Based on the evidence presented, I conclude applicant mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In the Conclusions section of his decision, the Judge noted that Applicant is aware of his\nfinancial problems and has the apparent means to remedy them.  However, Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that he will actually do so.  The Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s debts are recent and that,\ndespite his fiance\u2019s unemployment, they did not result from causes beyond Applicant\u2019s control.\n\u201c[T]here is insufficient information for me to conclude that Applicant has satisfied the doubts about\nhis suitability for a clearance raised by his debts.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \nApplicant has requested an opportunity to submit new matters not contained in the record.\nThe Board has no authority to grant that request.

However, a party\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions ins\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

In addition to the facts entered through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 29 years old and has been employed by a large defense contractor since June 2005. He and his fiancee live together and are the parents of a six-year-old child. Since July 2007, he has been enrolled in his employer\u2019s leadership development program, designed to expose employees with potential for future technical and management expertise to different aspects of the company\u2019s business operations.

On August 21,\n2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nraise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n2\nGuideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on November 13, 2008, and I convened a hearing on December 16,\n2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented three exhibits\n(Gx. 1 - 3). Applicant testified and submitted one exhibit (Ax. A). DOHA received the\ntranscript of hearing (Tr.) on December 29, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $25,079\nfor 24 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.x). Applicant admitted all of the SOR\nallegations, except for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x. In addition to the facts entered\nthrough Applicant\u2019s admissions, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old and has been employed by a large defense contractor\nsince June 2005. He and his fiancee live together and are the parents of a six-year-old\nchild. Since July 2007, he has been enrolled in his employer\u2019s leadership development\nprogram, designed to expose employees with potential for future technical and\nmanagement expertise to different aspects of the company\u2019s business operations.\nApplicant graduated from college in December 2002 with a degree in transportation\nlogistics. He received a masters degree in the same field from the same university in\nMay 2005. From October 2001 until May 2005, he worked as a collections analyst for a\nlarge national bank. (Gx. 1)\nIn response to e-QIP questions about his finances, Applicant disclosed multiple\ndelinquent debts for personal credit accounts. He also disclosed that his car was briefly\nrepossessed by the bank until he was able to pay the amount past due. (Gx. 1) In\nresponse to interrogatories sent to him by DOHA adjudicators, Applicant confirmed the\ndebts attributed to him that were reported in a credit bureau report obtained during his\nbackground investigation. (Gx. 2 and 3) However, some of the debts have been\nreported twice. The credit card debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d (Citi Financial for $5,678) is the\nsame account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g (LVNV Funding/Citi Financial for $6,048). The unpaid\nmedical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.I (Gulf Coast Collections for $80) is the same account\nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.h. The unpaid telephone bills listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.r ($886 each\nto AFNI/AT&T (Bellsouth) and CBCS/Bellsouth, respectively) represent the same\naccount listed in SOR \u00b6 1.x. Accordingly, the total amount Applicant actually owes is\n$11,501 for 20 accounts. (Ax. A; Tr. 27 - 29)\nApplicant has been steadily employed since 2001. His fiancee, however,\nexperienced job layoffs between April and July 2006, between June and September\n2007, and between May and July 2008. (Ax. A) Applicant has been trying to reduce\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n3\nexpenses of late. He and his fiancee moved to a new residence in August 2008, which\nhas lowered their rent by about $200 (Tr. 27), and they have reduced spending on\nthings like internet service, cable television, and other monthly accounts. Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter, who has been attending private school, will be moving to a public school in\nthe next school year. (Tr. 55 - 56) A review of Applicant\u2019s current finances showed he\nand his fiancee have about $786 left each month after expenses. (Tr. 36 - 41)\nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in June 2008, he provided\ninformation showing he was aware of his debts and their current status (e.g, balance,\nwhich collection firm holds the account, etc.). He also presented information showing he\nhad made minimal payments of $5 each to most of his creditors, ostensibly to show he\nhad contacted them and would be establishing payment plans. However, his response\nto interrogatories also included information showing that as recently as June 2008, he\nwas overdrawn on his checking account on multiple occasions. (Gx. 2) At hearing,\nApplicant presented information showing that in June 2008 he paid off a delinquent\nretail store account not listed in the SOR, and that in October and November he paid\nabout $2,000 to satisfy another credit card account not listed in the SOR. (Ax. A)\nApplicant intends to begin paying off his debts in a systematic way in 2009. He\nalso asserted he has repayment agreements with 10 of his 20 creditors. However, he\npresented no information to corroborate his claims or to show that he has made any\npayments to any of the creditors listed in the SOR since June 2008. (Ax. A; Tr. 41 - 54)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,3\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n4\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n5\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.6\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6 1. Even after omitting the duplicate accounts listed in the SOR, he still owes at\nleast $11,000 for 20 debts, some of which have been delinquent for more than three\nyears. Available information also shows Applicant has not paid or resolved any of the\ndebts listed alleged. He has demonstrated a command of the information about and\nstatus of his debts. However, he has not shown why, in light of a positive monthly\ncashflow in excess of $700 for the second half of the 2008 calendar year, he has not\n\n See footnote 7, supra. \n7\n5\npaid even his most modest debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. 1.I, 1.k, 1.t and 1.w allege debts less\nthan $100 each). Accordingly, the record requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant has not presented any information that would support\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20. His financial problems are\nrecent, in that they remain unresolved. Despite his obvious understanding of where he\nstands regarding most of his debts, he has not explained how he came to accrue so\nmuch debt. The fact his wife experienced three brief periods of unemployment does not,\nwithout more, explain his current circumstances or overall failure to be more proactive in\nresolving his delinquencies. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to present\ninformation sufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s adverse information about his\nfinances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 29 years old and\nappears to be a mature, responsible adult. He has the potential for continued\nprofessional advancement through his participation in his company\u2019s leadership\ndevelopment program. However, while it bodes well for him that he is well-organized\nand knows what he has to do to resolve his finances, he has not demonstrated that he\nwill actually do so or that the way he and his fiancee manage their finances will preclude\na recurrence of his financial problems. In summary, there is insufficient information for\nme to conclude that Applicant has satisfied the doubts about his suitability for a\nclearance raised by his debts. Because protection of the national interest is paramount\nin these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.l, 1.r:\nFor Applicant\n Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.e - 1.k, \n     1.m - 1.q, 1.s - 1.x: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Applicant is 43 years old and married for the third time. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Machine Test Technician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this subparagraph.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: James W. Green, Attorney At Law\nEdmunds, Green & Robinson, LLP\nJanuary 9, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions dated July\n3, 2007.  On June 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 8, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on September 4, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 12,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for October 8, 2008.  A request for continuance was\ngranted, rescheduling the matter for November 18, 2008.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented eight exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8.\nThe Applicant called one witness, presented six exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through F, and testified on his own behalf.  The record was left open until\nclose of business on November 28, 2008, to allow the Applicant to submit additional\nsupporting documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit,\n\n2\nconsisting of six enclosures, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit that was\nadmitted into evidence without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on\nDecember 4, 2008.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 43 years old and married for the third\ntime.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Machine Test Technician and is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nsubparagraph.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated July 31, 2007, May 23, 2008, and\nAugust 22, 2008, indicate that he remains indebted in the amount of approximately\n$12,000.00.  (See Government Exhibits 3, 5 and 6).  Even though some of the\ndelinquent debts owed are not large ones,  the Applicant has not paid them.  \nApplicant was born in France.  He came to the United States in 1987, at the age\nof twenty-three, He has been married three times.  During his second marriage, from\napproximately 1994 to 1998, his wife spent money recklessly and did not pay the bills.\nAlthough he worked three jobs and six to seven days a week to please her, he was not\ninvolved in the household finances.  (Tr. p. 52).  His wife handled the finances and he\nwas not aware that the bills were not being paid.  She suggested that Bankruptcy would\nbe a good option to resolve their indebtedness.  The Applicant agreed and on August\n25, 1998, he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7.  On December 2, 1998, his\nunsecured debts were discharged.  (Government Exhibit 1).   \nAt some point, the Applicant\u2019s wife took their son and moved out of state.  The\nApplicant, wanting to be close to his son, left his job and followed them. Any money  he\nhad he gave to his ex-wife so that she would allow him to see his son.  A vehicle that his\nex-wife was supposed to make the payments on was repossessed for lack of payment.  \nThe Applicant was unemployed for about six months.  He supported himself by working\nodd jobs and using credit cards.  His wife also suffered some health problems related to\na diagnosis of endometriosis that required surgery.  Their insurance paid some of the\n\n3\ndebt, but not all of it.  The Applicant believes that his creditors lost track of how to locate\nhim.  (Tr. P. 52).    \nThe Applicant is indebted to the following creditors.  A debt owed to Sprint PCS\nin the amount of $130.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to PRGRSVMGNT in the\namount of $34.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to Washington Mutual in the\namount of $487.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to Sprint Telecom in the amount\nof $108.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to Cal Bus Bureau in the amount of\n$320.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to Cal Bus Bureau in the amount of $50.00\nremains outstanding.  A debt owed to Bay Area CR in the amount of $385.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to Palisades/Verizon in the amount of $447.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to AAC/Household in the amount of $968.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to Pacific Gas & Electric in the amount of $19.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to 1STMWTDDELTA in the amount of $186.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to CACVLLC/Household Automotive in the amount of\n$12,385.00 was reduced to $4,000.00 and remains outstanding.  A debt towed to Cal\nCoast Medical Payment Data in the amount of $126.00 remains outstanding.  A debt\nowed to Central Financial in the amount of $55.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to\nGess and Associates in the amount of $66.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to\nAFNI/Verizon in the amount of $389.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to\nParagonway/Advance American Cash in the amount of $300.00 remains outstanding.  A\ndebt owed to PRIG Mgt Sys/Medical Payment Data in the amount of $100.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to TA Ross Coll in the amount of $790.00 remains\noutstanding.  Two debts owed to Medical Payment Data in the amount of $359.00 and\n$320.00 respectively, remain outstanding.  A debt owed to Ca Bus Bureau in the\namount of $50.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to Reli Rec Svc in the amount of\n$103.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to CB Stockon in the amount of $460.00\nremains outstanding.  A debt owed to Providian Bank in the amount of $2,259.00\nremains outstanding.  A debt owed to CMRE Finance in the amount of $109.00 remains\noutstanding.        \nIn 2005, the Applicant started working for his current employer.  He married his\ncurrent wife last year and they have a three year old son.  Applicant testified that he was\nnot aware of his outstanding debts until his interview with an investigator from DoD in\nSeptember 2007.  He further stated that he did not know if he had to pay his delinquent\ndebts because they were at least five years old.  (Tr. pp. 73-74).  He did not hire an\nattorney to assist him with his case until six weeks before the hearing.\nIn October 2008, a debt owed to LBK Management in the amount of $2,970.00\nstarted garnishing the Applicant\u2019s wages in the amount of $325.00 per week.  (Tr. p.\n46).  He has made seven payments as of today\u2019s date.    \nNot realizing the importance of paying his delinquent debts, just two weeks\nbefore the hearing, the Applicant contacted a consumer credit counselor to assist in\nconsolidating his outstanding debt.  A payment plan is now in place that requires that he\npay $170.00 a month to the consumer credit counselor that will go toward payment of\n\n4\nhis outstanding debts, with the exception of the debt owed to LBK that is being paid\nthrough garnishment.  (Tr. p. 48 and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).  Applicant claims\nthat he will stick to the payment plan as long as he is receiving financial assistance from\nhis mother-in-law.  (Tr. p. 49).  Since his separation with this second wife, Applicant has\nconsistently paid child support for their son, However, he stopped making those\npayments about three months ago in order to use that money to pay other debts.  \nApplicant currently works as much overtime he can get.  His present wife is a full\ntime college student and not employed.  They receive financial support from his mother-\nin-law in the amount of about $800.00 a month in order to meet their regular monthly\nliving expenses.  (Tr. p. 25).  In about a year, his wife will graduate from college and\nstart working, anticipating that she will earn between $12.00 and $15.00 per hour. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he intentionally falsified material\naspects of his personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing dated July 3. 2007. \nQuestion 28(a) of the application asked the Applicant\nif he has ever been over 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered\n\u201cYES\u201d, and listed only one debt owed to Collect American for a repossessed vehicle.\nThis was not accurate.  The Applicant failed to list the other twenty six delinquent debts\nset forth under paragraph 1 of the SOR.  Question 28(b) asked him if he was currently\n90 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government\nExhibit 2).  This was a false answer.  Again, the Applicant failed to list any of the debts\nset forth in the SOR.  The Applicant explained that he was confused by the questions,\nEnglish is not his first language, and he did not know about the debts until he met with\nthe investigator during his background investigation.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR\nand Tr. pp 55 and 61).  I find that the Applicant knew about his delinquent debts at the\ntime he completed the application and intentionally sought to conceal them from the\nGovernment.   \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law testified that she has known the Applicant for four\nyears and sees him twice a month.  She considers him to be responsible, reliable and\ntrustworthy.  She contributed $800.00 a month toward their monthly household income.\nShe realizes that the Applicant has significant debt that was caused by his ex-wife and\nplans to continue to help them financially, but she has no plans of paying the Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquent debt.  (Tr. pp. 24 - 35).\nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor and coworkers attest to\nhis dependability and trustworthiness.  He is considered to be a man of good character\nand integrity, and is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nand B).\n\n5\nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for the past three years reflect that he\nhas either met, exceeded, or has been outstanding in every category required in his job\ndescription.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and E).\nApplicant received a certificate for receiving financial counseling on October 16,\n2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n6\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n\n7\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and he has been untruthful on\nhis Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates\npoor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because\nof the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nAdmittedly, the Applicant\u2019s second wife contributed to his financial delinquencies.\nHowever, until recently he has not demonstrated good financial judgment either.\nDespite the fact that they divorced in 1997, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1998, they still\nhad excessive indebtedness.  Since then and until recently, the Applicant ignored his\ndelinquent debts.  He started working for his current employer in 2005.  He states that\nhe learned about the debts in September 2007.  Two weeks before the hearing, in\nNovember 2008, the Applicant contacted a consumer credit counselor to consolidate his\ndebts and set up a payment plan to resolve them.  At the present time, all of his debts\nremain owing.  One of his debts is being paid through garnishment.  The others, he\nplans to pay through the payment plan and as of now he has made just one payment.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.\n\n8\nWith respect to his finances, the Applicant has in excess of $12,000.00 in\ndelinquent debt.  He has just started the financial rehabilitation process and has a long\nway to go before they are resolved.  At the present time, he has not presented sufficient\nevidence to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility or that he has resolved\nhis financial indebtedness.\nUpon review of his financial statement, it appears that he has little disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his past due bills.  Depending on his overtime\nand with the help of his mother-in-law, he is barely able to make ends meet.  In fact, he\nstopped paying child support to his second wife.  There is little evidence of financial\nrehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  His\nfinancial problems remain current, they are not isolated, and until two weeks ago, the\nApplicant had not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve his debts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \nWith respect to Guideline E, the Applicant deliberately concealed material\ninformation from the Government on his security clearance application in response to\nhis financial matters.  With the particular evidence that I have been provided, there is no\nreasonable excuse for his failure to answer the questions truthfully. Although English is\nhis second language, if he cannot understand the questions on the security clearance\napplication, and answer them correctly, he cannot be found eligible to protect the\nnational secrets of the United States.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the\nApplicant cannot be trusted with the national secrets.  Disqualifying Condition 16(a)  the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the\nApplicant deliberately sought to conceal material information from the Government and\nthat he cannot be trusted with the national secrets.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n9\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n    Subpara.  1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.y.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.z.:\nAgainst the Applicant\n    Subpara.  1.aa.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.bb.: Against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n\n10\n",

On July 11, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nNovember 28, 2008\n\nApplicant and his counsel terminated their working relationship on September 29, 2008, several weeks before\n2\nthe hearing. AE S (Letter dated September 29, 2008).\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 17, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on August 5, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge.  DOHA received the request on August 7, 2008. Department\n2\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on August 21, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment on September 4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 29,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 15, 2008. The government\noffered 11 exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted 19\nexhibits (AE) A through S, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 23, 2008. I held\nthe record open until November 5, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  On\nNovember 5, 2008, he submitted AE T through DD, without objection. Applicant also\nrequested an additional seven days to submit one additional document. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request by Order dated November 6, 2008. On November 11, 2008,\nApplicant submitted this document, AE EE, without objection. Applicant\u2019s additional\ndocumentation has been marked and admitted into evidence. The record closed on\nNovember 11, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on October 2, 2008, less than 15 days prior\nto the hearing. At the hearing, I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the\nDirective to receive the hearing notice 15 days prior to the hearing date. Applicant\naffirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c -1.e, 1.g -1.q, 1.s, and 1.t of the SOR, with explanations. He\ndenied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.r of the SOR. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n3\nApplicant, who is 44 years old, works as a system administrator for a Department\nof Defense contractor.

At the hearing, Applicant provided a verbal listing of his monthly\n6\nexpenses. Id. Since the hearing, his mortgage payment has been reduced $600. I also take Administrative\nnotice of the fact that the price of gasoline for cars has declined at least 50% in the last two months. Thus,\nApplicant gasoline costs are reduced by $200. Overall his monthly expenses have been reduced $800.\nGE 5 (Credit report, dated June 25, 2008); GE 6 (Credit report, dated August 4, 2007); GE 7 (Credit report,\n7\ndated January 12, 2007).\n3\nwork area also describes him as a dedicated worker who does his work very well and is\na good team player. He graduated from high school, attended college and received a\ncertificate in computer operations. Applicant also worked part-time for his church until\nAugust 2008.4\nApplicant married in 1985. He and wife separated in January 2008, but have not\nmoved forward with a divorce. They have four children, a 22-year-old daughter and\nthree sons, ages 12 to 19. Applicant\u2019s three sons live with him in the family home and\nhis daughter lives independently. His 19-year-old son works part-time at a fast food\nrestaurant. Although she works, his wife does not provide any child support.  \n5\nApplicant\u2019s bi-weekly gross pay is $2,500 and his bi-weekly net pay is $1,611.\nHis current monthly income totals $3,222. His monthly expenses average $3,305,\nleaving a monthly deficit of approximately $80. Applicant\u2019s household income has\ndeclined by at least $2,000 a month with the loss of his part-time job and his wife\u2019s\nincome.      \n6\nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated January 12, 2007, August 4, 2007,\nJune 25, 2008, and the SOR, shows a longstanding history of debt problems and the\nfollowing outstanding debts, totaling $42,055, and their current status, which are the\nreasons for security concerns under the financial considerations guideline:7\nSOR \u00b6\nCREDITOR/DEBT\nTYPE\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS \nEVIDENCE\n1.a\nJudgment - bank\ncredit card\n$  2,491\nUnpaid\nGE 5, GE 6, GE\n7; AE BB; Tr. 39-\n42, 46\n1.b\nJudgment\n$  3,370 \nPaid\nAE A; Tr. 128\n1.c\nMedical bill\n$  1,126\nPaid\nAE V; Tr. 47-48\n1.d.\nPhone bill\n$     179\nPaid\nAE B; AE X\n1.e\nMedical bill\n$       65\nPaid\nAE C; AE Y\n\nHis wife acknowledged this is her debt.

Because Applicant denied allegation 1.f in the SOR on the grounds it was the same as the\njudgment in allegation 1.a, the government had the burden of proving the debts were two different debts. A\nlisting of the two debts separately on a credit report would not establish the debts are separate debts because\na court case number will not be the same as a credit card account number. Applicant obtained the court\nrecords , which was the government\u2019s duty, and established the two debts are the same. \nGE 4, supra note 10, at 11; AE U (Letter, dated October 21, 2008); Tr. 47-48, 95-96.\n13\n5\nIn addition to the above debts, Applicant acknowledged at the hearing that the\ntwo time shares he and his wife owned are going to foreclosure. He paid the monthly\nmortgage on the time shares until his wife left. Without her income, he cannot pay these\ntwo mortgages. He paid his monthly mortgage on his home when his payment was\n$600 to $800 a month. His mortgagor raised his monthly mortgage payment from $600\na month to almost $1,500 a month after the mortgagor paid a $9,000 tax lien filed\nagainst Applicant for unpaid water bills. In February 2008, Applicant entered into a\nforbearance plan, but because of the high monthly payment, he missed payments\nbeginning in May 2008. Applicant recently renegotiated his forbearance plan. He and his\nestranged wife signed the agreement on October 25, 2008. Under the terms of the\nagreement, he must pay $852 a month on time for the next four months. If he complies\nwith these terms, the final balloon payment will be added back into a modified loan, if\napproved. He submitted his first payment on October 27, 2008.11\nApplicant denied owing the credit card debt of $2,389 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f,\nindicating that it was the same as the judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The government\ndisagreed and argued that the judgment and the credit card debt are different because\nof the $102 difference. Applicant stated that he had three credit cards with this particular\nbank and acknowledged he owed the balance on one debt and the judgment. He denied\nthat he owed the balance on a fourth credit card, stating that the judgment and largest\ncredit card with this bank were the same. The three credit reports indicated that\nApplicant had three credit cards with this bank. Credit card number 1 (allegation 1.f)\nshowed a balance of $2,062 in January 12, 2007, $2,172 in August 2007 and a balance\nof $2,389 in June 2008. Credit card number 2 had a balance of $832 in January 2007, a\nbalance of $954 in August 2007 and June 2008. Credit card number 3 has a zero\nbalance on all credit reports. The August 2000 credit report shows credit card number 1\nas an account in good standing and no other credit cards with this bank. Subsequent to\nthe hearing, Applicant obtained the court records. Based on these records, the\ngovernment has agreed the two debts are the same. In light of this evidence, I find that\nthe judgment in 1.a and the credit card debt in 1.f are the same.12\nApplicant believes his financial problems started in 2006 when he experienced\nproblems with depression and bipolar disease. He was taken to the hospital emergency\nroom after which, he started outpatient treatment for his mental health. He is not\ncurrently on medication. During the time he had these medical problems, he did not pay\nattention to his finances.13\n\n6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt over many years\nand has been unable to pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries have been ongoing and continuous since at least 1997 and are the\nresult of financial mismanagement. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant had medical\nproblems in 2006. He and his wife separated in January 2008 and he lost his part-time\njob in August 2008. As a result of the 2008 events, he lost approximately $2,000 in\nhousehold income. His financial problems arose long before either of these events.\nHowever, the loss of this income does impact his ability to pay his current debts and his\npast debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not fully applicable in this case\nbecause he has not shown he acted responsibly under the circumstances. His financial\nproblems are not improving and may be getting worse because of the foreclosures.  \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not sought financial counseling\n\n8\nand his financial problems are not under control or being resolved. This mitigating\ncondition is not applicable. \n Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has\nresolved nine debts. He also renegotiated a reasonable forbearance paln with his\nmortgagor which he believes he can manage based on his ability in the past to pay a\nlower mortgage. He, however, has not resolved the majority of his unpaid debts listed in\nthe SOR. This mitigating condition is partially applicable.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d applies to the medical bills listed in SOR allegations 1.q, 1.s and 1.t. Applicant\nlearned that one bill was not his, one bill did not exist and one creditor could not be\nlocated. He had a legitimate reason to challenge each debt. This mitigating condition\napplies to these three SOR debts only.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is\nto be commended for his efforts to resolve several debts. His debt issues are not recent,\nbut longstanding. He not only has problems with unpaid old debts, but he also has two\nproperties going to foreclosure. His monthly expenses exceed his income by $80,\nmaking it difficult for him to meet his monthly living expenses. His current finances do\nnot allow him to repay his older debts. His health issues two years ago and his\nseparation from his wife contributed to his financial problems, but do not excuse his\n\n9\nfailure to act more responsibly by taking control of his finances years ago to reduce his\nexpenses. His financial problems are the result of many years of poor money\nmanagement. He has not demonstrated a track record for managing his monthly income\nand expenses or a change in his attitude towards spending money. He has lived beyond\nhis financial means for many years.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On October 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 12, 2008, and waived his \nright to a hearing before an administrative judge. The Department exercised its right to  \nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest a hearing pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. On December 16, 2008, DOHA \nassigned the case to me and issued a Notice of Hearing the same day. The case was \nheard on January 15, 2009, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 \nand 2 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, and offered exhibits (AE) A \nthrough D into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non January 26, 2009.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nParagraph 1 of the SOR, but did not separately answer the allegations under Paragraph \n2. Since the three paragraph 2 allegations merely incorporate the factual allegations in \nparagraphs 1.b through 1.d by reference, they are also considered to have been \nadmitted. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old unmarried man, who enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps \nwhen he was 17. He served from September 1967 until September 1971 when he \nreceived an early honorable discharge due to his service in Viet Nam. He was a \ncorporal at the time, working as flight line mechanic on the Air Force\u2019s planes. (Tr. 24) In \n1982, he started working for his current employer, a federal contractor, as a flight \nmechanic in field service. He had a very successful and impressive career with the \ncontractor, becoming the company\u2019s Master Aircraft Mechanic, responsible for the \nmaintenance of some U.S. military planes. During his career he was deployed overseas \nfor three or four month intervals until February 2005, when he accepted a voluntary lay-\noff in lieu of termination.  \n \n \nIn 1968, Applicant started using marijuana while in boot camp and did so during \nhis deployment to Viet Nam. (Tr. 53) He continued using it casually after being \ndischarged in 1971 and up to 1982, when he obtained a position with a Federal \ncontractor and was granted a security clearance that he held until November 2004. (Tr. \n11; 85-86)  \n \n \nIn 1996, while working overseas, Applicant was bitten by a poisonous snake. He \nwas taken to a hospital where he received a blood transfusion and was immediately \nsent home for medical care. About three years later, he began experiencing various \nsymptoms requiring medical care, including loss of weight due to a decreased appetite. \nIn December 2000, he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, a liver disease, for which there \nwas no cure. He believed that he would eventually die from the illness. (Tr. 63; 70) After \nreceiving the diagnosis, he began smoking marijuana to stimulate his appetite and gain \nweight, which he was rapidly losing. (Tr. 64-65; 87) He generally smoked it on a daily \nbasis at home alone, and not during work hours. He admitted he held a security \nclearance at the time. (Tr. 65)   \n \n \nApplicant continued using marijuana until March 2002 when he was again sent to \nwork overseas to a country that had stringent drug laws. (Tr. 67; 88; GE 2) During that \ndeployment, he periodically vacationed in a western European country where smoking \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmarijuana is legal. After using it on vacation and returning to his employment in \nNovember 2004, he was involved in an accident at work that resulted in minor damage \nto an aircraft. As a consequence of that incident, the company ordered Applicant to \nundergo a drug test. The results were positive for marijuana. He subsequently agreed to \na voluntary layoff in lieu of a termination. (GE 2)  In May 2005, Applicant left his position \nwith the Federal contractor and returned to the United States.1 Other than on vacation, \nhe did not use marijuana while deployed overseas for his employment. Although he \npurchased it over the years for his personal use, he never distributed it. (Tr. 69) \n \n \nAfter coming home in May 2005, Applicant learned of an experimental protocol \nfor treating Hepatitis C that involved the use of chemotherapy. He enrolled in the \nprogram and began receiving injections that eventually cured him. During the treatment \nprocess, he continued using marijuana to relieve the severe side effects of \nchemotherapy. He decided to stop smoking marijuana when he learned that his former \nemployer wanted to rehire him and he needed a security clearance. According to his \ntestimony, the last time he smoked it was at a New Year\u2019s Eve party last year, even \nthough he knew that he would be applying for a security clearance, which he did on \nJanuary 9, 2008. However, in his response to Interrogatories, signed on May 7, 2008, \nhe continued to use it until February 2008. (GE 2) He estimated that from December \n2004 until sometime in February 2008, he used marijuana about 50 times. (GE 2) He \nadmits he made a serious mistake. (Tr. 80) He believes he was addicted to it, but is no \nlonger addicted. (Tr. 90) He does not intend to use it in the future, especially if he \nreturns to work for a defesne contractor. (Tr. 89; 93: GE 2; Answer) \n  \n \nOver the course of his military career and 23 years of employment with a defense \ncontractor, Applicant received many impressive awards and commendations. He is \nparticularly proud of the mechanical work he did on one aircraft that enabled it to break \nnumerous performance records. (Tr. 42; AE D) He submitted several job performance \nevaluations and letters of recommendation, all of which give him high ratings. (AE A \nthrough C)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n                                                          \n1This federal employer is seeking to re-employ him and has sponsored him for a security \nclearance.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that any determination adverse to an applicant shall be \n\u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and \nhallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets forth conditions that could raise a drug involvement security \nconcern and be disqualifying. They include: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nApplicant admitted that he purchased and used marijuana from September 1967 \nuntil September 1982, and from December 2000 to January 2008. He tested positive for \nmarijuana use after damaging an aircraft in 2004. That evidence established facts that \nraise security concerns under AG \u00b6 25(a), AG \u00b6 25(b), and AG \u00b6 25(c). He used the \nmarijuana after receiving a security clearance, warranting the application of AG \u00b6 25(g).   \n \nAfter the Government raised these security concerns, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut or produce evidence to prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 26 provides four \npotential mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n (c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAfter considering the record evidence, none of the mitigating conditions applies \nto this case. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply because Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency since 1967, with his last use occurring one year ago. Hence, his behavior \nwas sufficiently recent and frequent over the years to cast ongoing doubt about his \njudgment.  \nApplicant indicated that he generally used marijuana while home alone. Hence, \nAG \u00b6 26(b) (1) and (2) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s assertion that he has not used \nmarijuana since February of 2008 is not sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3), given his long history of using marijuana. Although Applicant testified that he \nwould no longer use it, he did not sign a formal statement of intent authorizing an \nautomatic revocation of a clearance should it be determined that he uses marijuana in \nthe future; hence AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) as no application.  \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 26(c) or AG \u00b6 26 \n(d). Initially, Applicant began using marijuana for recreational purposes and later for \nmedical purposes, albeit without an authorized medical prescription. He did not \ncomplete a prescribed drug treatment program as contemplated under the guidelines. \nIn addition to the normal concerns under Guideline H, at issue here is whether \nApplicant is disqualified, as a matter of law, from security clearance eligibility due to his \nillegal drug use. The pertinent law is now 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, which provides, in relevant \npart, as follows: \u201cAfter January 1, 2008, the head of a Federal agency may not grant or \nrenew a security clearance for a covered person who is an unlawful user of a controlled \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsubstance or an addict\u201d as defined by federal law. This prohibition uses language that is \nnearly identical to the previous prohibition in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.2  \nAs a starting point, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c applies to Applicant because he is an \nemployee of a federal contractor.3 Second, there is no evidence to prove that Applicant \nis an addict. Third, there is ample evidence to prove that Applicant was an unlawful user \nof a controlled substance, as the record evidence shows that Applicant smoked \nmarijuana on a fairly regular basis for more than 20 years and did so until early 2008. \nBut, there is insufficient evidence to prove that Applicant is currently an unlawful user. \n(Emphasis added).  \nThe statutory prohibition in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b), like its predecessor in 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 986(c)(2), uses the present tense, not the past tense. A plain-meaning reading of the \nstatute cannot be stretched to apply Applicant\u2019s marijuana use that took place about \none year ago in January and February 2008. To read it otherwise would result in a \nmandatory disqualification of a person who engaged in drug abuse three years ago or \nperhaps at any time in the past, a result inconsistent with the plain meaning of the \nstatute. This interpretation of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c (b) is consistent with Appeal Board case \nlaw from 2003 and 2005 when it interpreted 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c) (2) in the same way.4  \nHence, the current federal statute pertaining to substance abuse does not apply to this \ncase. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n AG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n                                                          \n2 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c) (2) (2008) (\u201cThe person is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled \nsubstance\u201d as defined by federal law.). \n3 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435(a) (2) (defining a covered person under the statute). \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 03-25009 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005) (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) uses the present \ntense, not the past tense, when referring to unlawful use of, or addiction to, controlled substances, \nconsequently, the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Congress intended that persons who \nhad been addicted to, or dependent on, controlled substances in the past to be forever barred from being \ngranted a clearance); ISCR Case No. 01-20314 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 2003) (Administrative Judge erred by \napplying  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) to an applicant who last used marijuana about two years before the \nhearing). \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n (e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; and \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nApplicant candidly admitted that he repeatedly smoked marijuana while \nvacationing in a country in which it is not illegal, but is illegal in the United States, \nraising a potential for exploitation and concern under AG \u00b6 16(e). He further \nadmitted that he did so while holding a security clearance and in violation of \nFederal contractor\u2019s rules and regulations, establishing a disqualification under \nAG \u00b6 16(f). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder the personal conduct guideline: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n9 \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter reviewing the above mitigating conditions and record evidence, I considered \none of them to be partially raised. Applicant acknowledged his long term marijuana use \nand the underlying reasons for doing so. But, he has not obtained counseling or taken \nany other steps to insure that he does not use marijuana in the future. Hence, AG \u00b6 \n17(d) has very limited application.   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nfollowing nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s candid testimony. He is \nan intelligent and successful 58-year-old man, who has a very impressive history of \nemployment accomplishments and a strong patriotic disposition. He began purchasing \nand using marijuana after he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1967 and continued \nusing it while in Viet Nam, and subsequent to his honorable discharge. He ceased using \nit in 1982 when he started employment with a Federal contractor. He resumed using it in \nDecember 2000 after learning he had an incurable disease, while holding a security \nclearance. He continued using it during and after a course of treatment for the disease \npreviously presumed to be fatal. He openly and honestly, discussed his marijuana \nhistory with the Government investigator and during this hearing. Although he appears \nready to stop smoking marijuana and asserts that he has not smoked for one year, he \ndid not present any independent evidence to support his assertions. Given his history of \nfrequent marijuana abuse, spanning at least twenty years, and an acknowledgement of \nhis prior addiction, he needs to establish a sufficient track record of rehabilitation and \ngood judgment, corroborated by independent and professional evidence, to persuade \nme that he has sufficiently addressed the underlying issues related to his long-term \nmarijuana use. There is no evidence of other misconduct or adverse information in his \nrecord of concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising under drug involvement and personal conduct \nguidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1f:    Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                               \n \n___________________________ \nSHARI DAM, Administrative Judge \n",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nDecember 5, 2006. On August 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 17, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nOctober 28, 2008. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2008. On December \n3, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2008. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Applicant did not receive the Notice of Hearing \nwithin 15 days as required by the Directive. He waived the 15 day notice requirement. \n(Tr at 6.) The Government offered 13 exhibits which were admitted as Government \nJanuary 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 13, without objection. Applicant testified and submitted nine exhibits \nwhich were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I, and admitted without \nobjection. The record was held open until January 9, 2009. One additional document \nwas timely submitted and admitted as AE J. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on \nDecember 23, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employed with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with the defense contractor since \nJune 2006. He is single and has no children. (Tr at 7-8; Gov 1.) \n \nFrom August 1998 to August 2002, Applicant was a full-time college student. On \nMay 16, 2002, he met with the dean to discuss what courses he needed to complete to \nbe eligible for graduation. At the end of the second summer session, he completed 126 \nsemester hours but did not have the required credits to graduate. (Tr at 48; Gov 4; Gov \n6; Gov 7; Gov 8; Gov 9.)  He did not meet the requirements for graduation because he \nneeded 27 credits in his major and only had 24. He needed four classes in his selected \nconcentration and only had three. He needed three classes at the 100 level of his major \nbut only had two. (Gov 4 at 7.)    \n \nThe college where Applicant attended sends out e-mails 6-8 times a year to \nstudents advising them of deadlines for them to apply for graduation. When advisors \nmeet with students, information related to application for graduation and degree \nrequirements are discussed.  In order to receive their degrees, students are required to \napply for graduation. The application for graduation requirements is available on the \nschool\u2019s website and is posted throughout the university. When students meet with the \nDean, the Dean discusses graduation requirements for completing their degree and the \napplication for graduation requirements. (Gov 4 at 6.)  \n \nAround September 2002, Applicant moved out of the area where his college was \nlocated. Prior to leaving the university, he had not talked with an advisor to insure that \nhe met all of the requirements for his degree. He did not verify with the registrar that he \nmet the requirements for graduation. Applicant did not apply for a degree. Although he \nnever received his diploma, he never contacted the school to ask about his diploma. \nApplicant was disappointed with his performance in college and wanted to put his \ncollege career behind him. (Tr at 52-54, 58-60.)  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was hired as an administrative assistant with a defense \ncontractor. In the spring 2003, he was promoted to the position of legislative analyst. \nThis new position required a security clearance. He completed a security clearance \napplication on April 7, 2003. In response to question 5 which asks about an applicant\u2019s \neducational background, he listed that he had been awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree \n\n \n3 \n \n \non August 15, 2002. (Gov 3.) He was granted an interim SECRET security clearance \npending the outcome of his investigation. (Tr at 35.) \n \nApplicant worked as a legislative analyst but moved to a position as an onsite \ncontractor with a DOD agency. He worked at this location for approximately one and a \nhalf years. In November 2004, he was encouraged to apply for a federal employee \nposition with the DOD agency. (Tr at 36-37.) He submitted a resume in conjunction with \nhis application for federal employment on November 24, 2004. He listed on the resume \nthat he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2002. (Gov 13.)   \n \nOn March 21, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application in \nconjunction with his future status as a federal employee. In response to question 5, \nasking about his educational background, he listed that he had been awarded a \nBachelor of Arts degree on August 15, 2002. (Gov 2.) He became a federal government \nemployee in April 2005. His subsequent background investigation revealed that he had \nnot been awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree.  He was contacted by  a security official in \nthe fall 2005 about his academic credentials. (Tr at 37-40; 58-62.)  \n \nOn March 29, 2006, Applicant was notified that he was to be separated from \nfederal service effective April 5, 2006. He was barred from federal employment for a \nperiod of three years until February 17, 2009.  The basis for his removal was his \nmaterial intentional false statements pertaining to his educational credentials on his \nMarch 21, 2005, security clearance application and on a resume submitted on \nNovember 24. (Gov 4; Gov 5.)  \n \nApplicant claims that he was not aware that he had to apply for a degree. He \nbelieved that you had to apply if you wanted to attend the graduation ceremony but not \nfor the degree. He was never concerned that his diploma was never sent to him. He \nnever saw posters which were posted throughout the campus about applying for \ngraduation. He first discovered that he was not awarded a degree in November 2005 \nafter the security office asked him about his educational background during his \nbackground investigation. He contacted the university and discovered that he was not \nawarded a degree. (Tr at 48, 53, 55, 58-61.) \n \nApplicant claims that he did not intend to falsify two security applications dated \nApril 7, 2003, and March 21, 2005. He also did not intend to falsify his resume \nsubmitted in November 2004. He believed that he had completed his degree after \nattending summer school in 2002. (Tr at 26, 34, 52; Gov 4; Gov 10.)  \n \nApplicant asks that his superior performance over the past six years be \nconsidered. While not conceding that he intentionally falsified his educational \ncredentials, Applicant states, \u201cThat while not insignificant, the offense is unique. The \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. It should not case doubt on my reliability, trustworthiness, \nmy good judgment.\u201d (Tr at 26.)  After he was barred from federal employment, his \nsuperiors recommended him for a position with one of their contractors located at \nanother site. (AE C; AE F; AE I.) Applicant states that he has maintained an excellent \n\n \n4 \n \n \nrecord over the past six years, and that the security concerns raised by the alleged \nfalsification are not representative of his behavior today and should not be the defining \npoint regarding his suitability for a security clearance. (Tr at 27.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor states that he is impressed with Applicant\u2019s \nattitude, work ethic, and morality. Applicant\u2019s customers and peers speak very highly of \nhim. He recommends Applicant for a security clearance. (AE E.) Applicant\u2019s recent  \nperformance review dated June 24, 2008, was favorable. The review indicates Applicant \nis a crucial member of the executive support staff. He is \u201cindependent and driven.\u201d He \nhas \u201cexcellent planning and coordination skills coupled with social skills\u201d which allow \nhim to be effective at all levels of the agency. (AE B.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor with the defense agency where Applicant worked as a \nfederal civilian wrote a letter on his behalf.  He supervised him during the one year that \nhe was a federal employee. Applicant also worked for two years as a contractor for the \nagency prior to becoming a federal employee. His former supervisor states that \nApplicant is one of the most dedicated, conscientious, responsible, and skilled \nprofessionals that he was worked with during his nearly 30 years of experience in the \nprivate sector, military, and Federal service.  While a federal employee, Applicant was in \ncharge of the Security and Policy Review division. He was responsible for the thorough \nreview of documents, presentations, video and still photography, briefings, new \nreleases, testing plans, conference exhibits to ensure that all materials were appropriate \nfor public release. His job included making sure the materials did not contain classified \ninformation or information that is contrary to U.S. government policy. They never had an \ninadvertent release of improper materials during the year Applicant was in charge of the \ndivision.  Applicant excelled as no other person who previously held the position ever \ndid. Since departing from federal service, Applicant has worked as a contractor \nassisting the government agency. He continues to exhibit the same skills, dedication \nand diligence in this new position.  If a federal service position were to open in the \nfuture, he has no reservations encouraging Applicant to apply and compete for the \nposition. (AE C.) \n \nOther co-workers have written reference letters attesting to Applicant\u2019s \nprofessionalism, work ethic, and trustworthiness. (AE D; AE F; AE G; AE H.) During his \ncareer, he received numerous letters of appreciation. (AE A.) He attends church \nregularly.  He coaches a team in an adult soccer league. He belongs to a rock climbing \nand spelunking group. (Tr at 40-43.)      \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n6 \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s case poses an interesting dilemma. Either he deliberately falsified his \nacademic credentials on two security clearance applications and on his resume, or he \nwas grossly indifferent about following the university policies and procedures as to what \nwas required to complete his degree and obtain his diploma. The latter also raises \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s ability to safeguard classified information. If a person has \ndifficulty following procedures as to what is required to complete their degree, it is likely \nthey will have difficulty following the procedures required to safeguard classified \ninformation.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, I find there is a preponderance of the evidence that he \nintentionally falsified his security clearance applications, dated April 7, 2003, and March \n21, 2005, and his November 2004 resume when he listed that he obtained a B.A. \ndegree in August 2002.  Applicant appears to be a very intelligent individual. I find his \ntestimony that he believed that he had a college degree less than credible. The \nuniversity that Applicant attended takes significant efforts to publish the requirements for \ngraduation as well as the need to apply for graduation throughout the campus. Applicant \nmet with the dean in May 2002 to discuss the requirements needed for graduation.  His \nprofessed ignorance of the need to apply for his degree conflict with the efforts the \nuniversity takes to counsel students on degree and graduation requirements. \nGraduating from college is a significant milestone in a person\u2019s life. Applicant\u2019s lack of \nconcern that he was never sent his diploma defies logic.    \n \n \nThe following Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) applies to the \nfacts of this case: \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his \neducational background in response to question 5 on his security clearance \napplications, dated April 7, 2003, and March 21, 2005, when he listed he earned a \nBachelor of Arts degree in August 2002. It also applies to the resume Applicant \nsubmitted on November 24, 2004. \n \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern can be mitigated.  The following Personal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) have the potential to apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not \napply.  Applicant did not admit that he did not complete his college degree until it was \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndiscovered during his background investigation, and the issue of his lack of degree was \nraised by the investigator conducting the background investigation. \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c ) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) does not apply.  The government expects Applicants to be truthful \nwith the government at all times.  Applicant falsified that he had a college degree on \nthree separate occasions. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, this was not a one-time \ncircumstance. He falsely held himself out as a college graduate on three separate \noccasions between April 2003 to March 2005.  Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to raise \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s six years of \nworking for the federal government both as a contractor and a federal employee. While, \nApplicant is highly thought of by his supervisor, former supervisor, and co-workers, his \nlack of candor pertaining to his educational background raise serious security concerns \nunder personal conduct. His deliberate falsifications outweigh the favorable information \nabout his work performance. In security clearance cases, any doubt as to whether an \napplicant should be granted a security clearance must be ruled in favor of national \nsecurity. Despite Applicant\u2019s outstanding work performance and favorable references, \ndoubts remain about his ability to protect classified information because of his deliberate \nfalsifications on two security clearance applications and a resume. I find against \nApplicant under Personal Conduct. \n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on November 2, 2007. On November 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, \nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 4, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n15, 2009. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2009. On February 6, 2009, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for February 24, 2009. The \nhearing was held, as scheduled. The Government offered six exhibits which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 9 without objection. The Applicant testified, \nand offered five exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 E without \nMarch 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nobjection. The transcript was received on March 3, 2009. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but \nadmits all of the other SOR allegations.   \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  She has worked for her current employer for five years. \nDuring that five-year period she has been promoted twice. She is a high school \ngraduate with some college credit. She has held a security clearance for 18 years. She \nis married but in the process of a divorce. She has two adult daughters, ages 23 and 27. \n(Tr at 6-7, 25-26, 50; Gov 1)   \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when she was 15. She began to drink heavily \nin 1998 after her first marriage ended in divorce. She would drink approximately 4-6 \ndrinks on weekends. Her heaviest period of drinking occurred in 2004. She would drink \nuntil she blacked out at times. Her father unexpectedly passed away in 2004. Her \nsecond husband, a truck driver, was on the road for months at a time. Her children were \ngrown and Applicant was left alone. (Tr at 43-44, 50-51) \n \nOn November 17, 2004, Applicant was drinking at a bar with some friends. She \ndrank approximately four to five beers over a four hour period. She left the bar and \nstarted to drive home. A police officer pulled her over after observing her cross the \ncenter line. Applicant refused to take a breathalyzer test. She failed a field sobriety test. \nShe was arrested for Driving While Under the Influence (DUI). On February 25, 2005, \nApplicant pled and was found guilty. She was ordered to pay a fine, serve one year \nprobation, attend DUI Level I course, and complete 25 hours of community service.  Her \nlicense was revoked for six months. She took the DUI course on her own volition based \non the advice of her attorney prior to appearing in court. (Tr at 27-30; Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov \n4; Gov 8) \n \nApplicant attended alcohol classes at the Harbor City Counseling Center. She \nattended 12 group sessions and six Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Her license was \nrestricted. No one told Applicant that she should not drink alcohol during these \ncounseling sessions. (Tr at 31, 45; Gov 2 at 4)   \n \nOn June 27, 2007, Applicant was driving home after going to dinner with some \nfriends. She drank approximately four to five beers over a three hour period. A police \nofficer observed her crossing the center line and she was pulled over. She refused a \nbreathalyzer test. She failed a field sobriety test. She was charged with DUI \u2013 second \noffense.  On January 31, 2008, a jury found Applicant guilty of DUI \u2013 second offense. \nShe was ordered to serve 30 days in jail, 11 month supervised probation, ordered to \npay $990 in fines and court costs. She was ordered to complete DUI School Level 2 and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nundergo an alcohol and substance abuse evaluation. Her driver\u2019s license was revoked \nfor five years. An ignition interlock device was placed on her vehicle for one year. (Tr at \n33-37; Gov 2 at 3, 7-19; Gov 5; Gov 6; Gov 7; Gov 8) \n \nApplicant\u2019s second DUI offense was a wake-up call for her. She realized that she \nhad a lot of issues that she needed to confront. She immediately sought help though her \ncompany\u2019s Employee Assistance Program. On September 4, 2007, she voluntarily \nentered in-patient treatment at an alcohol treatment center. She was discharged on \nSeptember 6, 2007. This was the detoxification stage of the program. The treatment \nrecords indicate that Applicant was drinking a 12-pack of beer a day until she blacked \nout. Applicant disputes this amount. She was diagnosed by a physician as being alcohol \ndependent. She also was diagnosed with depressive disorder not otherwise specified. \nWhen Applicant completed detox, there were no beds available in the rehabilitation \ncenter. Applicant entered the alcohol rehabilitation program in October 2007 when a \nbed was available.  (Tr at 38-40, 55-57; Gov 9; Answer to SOR) \n \nOn October 28, 2007, she entered the in-patient alcohol rehabilitation program. \nUpon successful completion of the program, Applicant continued to see an out-patient \ntherapist for awhile. She attends AA meetings once or twice a month.  She completed a \ncourt-ordered Level II alcohol counseling program on November 24, 2008. She \nsuccessfully completed the terms of probation for her second DUI offense on December \n30, 2008. (Tr at 37, 40-41, 48, 57-59; Gov 2; AE A; AE D; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant acknowledges that she cannot drink alcohol again. She has no \nintention of drinking alcohol again. She feels great about her sobriety. She admits to \nrelapsing in June 2008. On that day, she was informed by a friend that her husband was \nhaving an affair. She was very upset and drank a six-pack of beer. Applicant\u2019s brother is \na recovering alcoholic and provides a lot of support. Her mother and her daughters also \nsupport her. She told them of her relapse and they have been very supportive. She is in \nthe process of divorcing her husband. She is working the 12 steps. She is on step 4 \nwhich is cleaning out your inventory. (Tr at 46-50, 52-53, 60)  \n \n The proposal and process manager at Applicant\u2019s company wrote a letter on her \nbehalf. He supervised her for several months in 2004 and 2005.  He states that \nApplicant is one of the most consistent, reliable, dependable and honest people he \nknows. She is dedicated to her responsibilities and can always be counted on to do the \nright thing. He is aware of her recent personal difficulties but states that she has made \ngreat strides over the past year and a half to overcome these difficulties. She is a \ntrustworthy individual with a high degree of personal integrity and loyalty. (AE B) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor wrote a letter on her behalf. She has worked with \nApplicant for 11 years. She states Applicant is a huge asset. She demonstrates a sense \nof optimism, ownership, and commitment to the job. She is aware of Applicant\u2019s \npersonal issues but states that Applicant\u2019s personal issues never impacted work. She \nearned the respect of her co-workers and is an extremely professional and hard working \nindividual. Applicant has kept her informed of her personal situation. She sought help \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthrough the Employee Assistance Program and counseling. She has taken a negative \nsituation and used it to make her a better person. She recommends her for a security \nclearance. (AE C) \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance report was favorable. Her immediate \nsupervisor noted in the comments \u201c [Applicant] has done a terrific job of transitioning \ninto the new organization\u2026.She is looked to as a leader in the group and is regularly \ncalled upon to assume the lead role, in my absence. She is always willing and very \ncapable of the responsibilities of this role. [She] provides consistent, timely, and \naccurate support to upper management\u2026..\u201d (AE E)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s November 15, 2004, and June 27, 2007, arrests for Driving \nWhile Under the Influence. \n \nAC DC &22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent) applies. Applicant admits to drinking heavily on the weekends. Her \nheaviest drinking occurred in 2004. She admits to drinking until she blacked out on \nseveral occasions. On occasion, her alcohol use was excessive and impaired her \njudgment.   \n \nAC DC &22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence) \napplies. A physician at the treatment center where Applicant attended in-patient \ntreatment in October 2007 diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent with a depressive \ndisorder, not otherwise specified.  \n \nAC DC &22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence \nand completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program) applies. Applicant completed \n\n \n6 \n \n \noutpatient alcohol treatment on November 2007. She remained sober for approximately \nseven months. In June 2008, she relapsed as a result of the shocking news that her \nhusband was having an affair. It is acknowledged that this was a one-time incident and \nApplicant has not drank alcohol since that date.     \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. While serious concerns \nare raised pertaining to Applicant\u2019s relapse in June 2008, after being advised not to \ndrink alcohol during her inpatient treatment in the fall 2007, her relapse is \nunderstandable. She reacted to some unfortunate news that she was not expecting. \nShe drank a six-pack of beer after she learned her husband was having an affair. She \ntold her daughters and her brother that she relapsed. They support her in her efforts to \nremain sober. She has not drank since the June 2008 relapse and has no intention of \ndrinking in the future. She attends AA and is working on the 12-step program. The \nrecommendations from her supervisors indicates that she is reliable, trustworthy and \ndemonstrates good judgment.  \n \n \nAC MC & 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser) applies.  Applicant acknowledges that she is an alcoholic.  She admits \nthat she did not deal with the issue seriously until after her second DUI. She \nsuccessfully completed in-patient treatment, she attends AA, and is alcohol free. Her \none-time relapse is understandable. She acknowledged what she had done by telling \nher daughters and brother and continues to deal with her alcohol problem by attending \nAA meetings. She has not drank alcohol since June 2008 and does not intend to drink \nalcohol again.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under alcohol consumption. \nGuideline G is found for Applicant.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply. Applicant was \narrested and convicted for Driving Under the Influence on two occasions. Driving Under \nthe Influence is a serious criminal offense.   \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence by way of exhibits and testimony \nto raise CC DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSeptember 22, 2005.)   \n   \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nMore than a year and half has passed since Applicant\u2019s second DUI offense. She has \nhad no subsequent arrests. She successfully completed the terms of her probation on \nDecember 30, 2008.  Although she has struggled to remain sober, she has been \nproactive in her efforts to maintain sobriety. She has learned a difficult lesson as a result \nof her past drinking and driving. It is unlikely that she will repeat similar behavior again. \nHer past conduct, while serious, no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness or good judgment.  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) applies. Applicant successfully completed probation in \nDecember 2008. She has had no subsequent arrests. She expressed much remorse \nabout her past two arrests. She successfully completed several counseling programs \nand attends AA meetings. She has an excellent employment record. Applicant has  \nmitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \n\n \n8 \n \n \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s past \nstruggles with alcohol. I considered that she successfully completed several counseling \nprograms, including a 28-day treatment program in October 2007. I considered that her \nalcohol use never affected her job performance. I considered that Applicant was sober \nfrom the fall 2007 to June 2008. She suffered a one-day relapse as a result of some \nshocking news that she received. Since the relapse, she has remained sober. She has \nthe support of her mother, daughters and brother in fight to remain sober. She \nsuccessfully completed the terms of her probation. She does not intend to drink alcohol \nin the future. I also considered the favorable comments of Applicant\u2019s superiors and her \nrecent performance report. While Applicant relapsed on one occasion, there is \nsubstantial evidence to conclude that her alcohol problem is currently under control. \nShe is aware that future alcohol use could jeopardize her ability to maintain a security \nclearance. Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, are \nfound for Applicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Abbott, Esquire\nJanuary 5, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on December 22, 2006.  On August 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines B and C for Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 2, 2008.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing on September 17, 2008, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request soon thereafter.  This case was\nassigned to another Administrative Judge in the Washington Hearing Office on October\n27, 2008.  However, the Applicant, through counsel, asked for a change of venue; and\n\n2\nas such, it was reassigned to the undersigned in the Western Hearing Office on October\n30, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on November 19, 2008.  The Government and Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel stipulated to Government Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, and Applicant Exhibits\n(AppXs) A through P.  Applicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on December 1, 2008.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request to\nkeep the record open until December 19, 2008, to submit additional matters.  On\nDecember 15, 2008, he submitted AppXs Q through V, which were received without\nobjection. The record closed on December 19, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Iran.  The request was granted.  The request, and the\nattached documents, were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the record.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 2.a. and 2.e.~2.h. of the SOR, with explanations.  He\ndenied the factual allegations in Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.e, 2.b. and 2.c. of the SOR.  He\nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nThe Applicant was born in Iran, but immigrated to the United States in 1978 at\nthe age of 17 (TR at page 14 lines 6~13, and at page 16 line 22 to page 19 line 8).  He\nattended college in the U.S., from which he graduated in 1981, and he became a\nnaturalized citizen in 1996 (TR at page 16 line 22 to page 19 line 8, and GX 1 at pages\n5~6 and 8).  He lives in a foreign country with his wife, where he works for a U.S.\nGovernment contractor (TR at page 14 line 14 to page 15 line 10, and GX 1 at page 7).\nThe country is not Iran (Id).\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n1.a.  The Applicant is a dual national of the U.S. and Iran (GX 1 at page 5~6).\nHe has expressed a genuine intention to renounce his Iranian citizenship (TR at page\n54 lines 2~18, at page 57 line 5 to page 59 line 16, and AppX U, see also AppXs Q~T).\n\u201cDepartment Counsel [DC] is satisfied with Applicant\u2019s stated efforts to renounce his\ndual citizenship\u201d (DC\u2019s Response to Applicant\u2019s Supplemental Information).\n\n3\n1.b.~1.e. and 2.h.  Despite being naturalized in 1996, the Applicant, who still held\nan Iranian passport, obtained a new Iranian passport in 2002, and renewed that\npassport in 2007 (GX 2).  He used this passport to travel to Iran in 2002, in 2005 and in\n2007 (TR at page 49 line 14 to page 51 line 13, and at page 66 line 24 to page 67 line\n5).  Each visit, he was required to pay a $42 fee, in order to leave Iran without being\nsubject to its compulsory military service (TR at page 47 line 8 to page 49 line 13, and\nAppX H).\nThe Applicant\u2019s 2002 visit was his first visit in 24 years, and he stayed for a\nmonth (TR at page 49 line 14 to page 51 line 13).  In 2005, the Applicant introduced his\nnew wife to his family, and stayed about three weeks (Id, and TR  at page 66 line 24 to\npage 67 line 5).  His last visit was in 2007, when his father passed away, and Applicant\nstayed about two weeks (Id).  In November of 2008, the Applicant turned over his\nIranian passport to his Facility Security Officer (FSO) and it was \u201cimmediately\ndestroyed,\u201d as evidenced by a letter from that FSO (AppX G).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a.~2.c.  The Applicants spouse is a dual national of Iran and France (TR at\npage 25 line 8 to page 29 line 25, and GX 1 at pages 12~13).  They met through an\nIranian-American website (GX 2).  She left Iran and immigrated to France when she\nwas ten or eleven years old (TR at page 62 line 14 to page 63 line 24).  She has every\nintention of applying for U.S. citizenship; but as they live in a third country, she can not\nyet satisfy the six month U.S. residency requirement, in order to make such an\napplication (AppXs E and K).\n2.d. and 2.e. The Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iran (TR at page\n30 line 14 to page 34 line 11, and GX 1 at pages 13~14).  She is 70 years old, has\nalways been a housewife, and lived in the U.S. in the 1990s as permanent resident\nalien (Id, and TR at page 36 lines 7~21, and at page 37 line 7 to page 39 line 12).\n2.f.  The Applicant has two brothers and one sister who are citizens and\nresidents of Iran (GX 1 at pages 15~18).  His 50 year old sister has no permanent\nemployment, and lives with his mother (TR at page 30 line 14 to page 34 line 11, and at\npage 36 lines 23~23).  He and his sister are not close (Id).  One brother lived in the U.S.\nfor nearly 30 years, but returned to Iran to take care of their mother when their father\npassed away in 2007 (TR at page 39 line 15 to page 41 line 5).  The Applicant is not\nclose to this brother (Id).  The other brother \u201chas an electronics shop\u201d (TR at page 41\nline 6 to page 42 line 1).  The Applicant is also not close to this brother (Id).  None of the\nApplicant\u2019s siblings have any connection with the Iranian government (TR at page 42\nlines 21~24).  The Applicant would not be subject to coercion vis-a-vis his Iranian\nrelatives (TR at page 43 line 12 to page 44 line 1).\n2.g.  The Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens of Iran and France, and reside in\nFrance (TR at 64 line 13~21).  Neither in-law works for any government (Id).\n\n4\nAs the Applicant\u2019s mother and siblings are Iranian and live in Iran, I must also\nconsider the country of Iran.  Iran is a state that sponsors terrorism.  The U.S. has not\nhad diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980.  It is a theocratic Islamic republic in which\nShi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political authority is\nvested in a learned religious scholar.  Iran\u2019s dismal and worsening human rights record\npresents a further threat to the U.S., as a large number of Iranians emigrated to the U.S.\nin 1979, after their Islamic revolution.  These immigrants often left behind family\nmembers in Iran.  Iran\u2019s security forces often target family members of political\nprisoners for harassment purposes.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\n\n5\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nParagraph 9 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Preference: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\u201d\nSubparagraph 10(a)(1) is applicable: \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation\nof a foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of\na family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport.\u201d  Here, the Applicant, a naturalized citizen, used an Iranian passport to enter\nthat country on three separate occasions.  This is clearly countered, however, by the\nmitigating conditions found under Subparagraphs 11(b) and 11(e).  Subparagraph 11(b)\nnotes that where \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship,\u201d this is mitigating.  I find that Applicant\u2019s renunciation intention to be\ngenuine.  Furthermore, under Subparagraph 11(e), the Applicant\u2019s \u201cpassport has been\ndestroyed [by] . . . the cognizant security authority,\u201d his FSO.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, Paragraph 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . .\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The\nApplicant\u2019s mother, two brothers and sister are citizens of and reside in the Iran.  His in-\nlaws and wife are also dual nationals with Iran.  This is clearly countered, however, by\nthe first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located . . . are such that it is unlikely the individual\n\n6\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  None of the Applicant\u2019s Iranian relatives\nhave any connection with the Iranian government.  Furthermore, the Applicant can not\nbe coerced by the government of Iran or any other government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHe has the unqualified support of those who know and have worked with the\nApplicant (AppXs A~D and F).  Of particular note are the comments of a retired\nBrigadier General, who avers, in part, the following:\nFinally, through my 32 years of military experience I consider that I have\nbecome an accurate judge of people whom I consider to be reliable and\ntrustworthy.  I have total confidence in . . . [the Applicant] and he has\nproved over 10 years that he can be fully trusted to hold a US Security\nClearance.  I believe that he is a loyal and committed American.  I would\nnot hesitate at all in recommending that . . . [the Applicant] hold a position\nof trust and responsibility, or that he be granted a national security\nclearance.  Hence, I urge you to recognize his loyalty to hold a security\nclearance.  I gladly vouch for him (AppX A at page 2).\nI have considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his alleged Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old senior software consultant employed by a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 2008. He has held a security clearance since July 2003 (GX 2 at 1). The allegations in the SOR are based on his conduct while working for previous employers. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor for the past six months characterizes his performance as stellar (AX B-3). Two co-workers describe him as hardworking, reliable, 3 and family oriented (AX B-4 and B-6). A former co-worker for two years considers him conscientious, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable (AX B-5).

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Greg D. McCormack, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal \nConduct) and M (Use of Information Technology Systems). Applicant rebutted the \nallegations regarding use of information technology systems, but he did not mitigate \nsecurity concerns based on personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on December 22, 2005. On \nNovember 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines E and M. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \nJuly 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 17, 2008; answered it on January 2, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on January 5, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 23, \n2009, and the case was assigned to an administrative judge on March 26, 2009. It was \nreassigned to me on April 15, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 20, 2009, \nscheduling the hearing for May 20, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were \nadmitted without objection. AX B consisted of seven documents, marked as B-1 through \nB-7; AX C consisted of six documents, marked as C-1 through C-6. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until May 27, 2009, to enable him to submit \na signed copy of AX B-1. The signed copy was timely submitted and received without \nobjection.  \n \n \nOn May 21, 2009, Department Counsel proffered two supplemental exhibits (GX \n9 and 10). I admitted them over defense objection. Applicant submitted a statement in \nsurrebuttal (AX D), which was admitted without objection. These exhibits are discussed \nin greater detail below. DOHA received the transcript on June 5, 2009, and the record \nclosed on the same day.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel proffered GX 9 and GX 10 in rebuttal to Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony at the hearing. His proffer is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected, and his comments are at HX II. On May 26, 2009, I issued \nan order admitting the supplemental exhibits and offering Applicant the option of \nsubmitting surrebuttal evidence or reopening the hearing (HX III). I based my ruling on \nthe policy favoring development of a full and complete record set out in the Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.19 and recognized by the Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 04-12449 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 14, 2007). I offered Applicant the option of reopening the hearing to protect his due \nprocess right to respond to the government\u2019s evidence. On June 5, 2009, after Applicant \nsubmitted AX D in surrebuttal, I again offered Applicant an opportunity to reopen the \nhearing (HX IV). He declined the offer (HX V).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.c. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior software consultant employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since October 2008. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since July 2003 (GX 2 at 1). The allegations in the SOR are based \non his conduct while working for previous employers. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor for the past six months characterizes his \nperformance as stellar (AX B-3). Two co-workers describe him as hardworking, reliable, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand family oriented (AX B-4 and B-6). A former co-worker for two years considers him \nconscientious, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable (AX B-5). A former subordinate \ndescribes him as honest, knowledgeable, family-oriented, a \u201cgreat all around guy,\u201d and \na good friend (AX B-7). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother regards him as trustworthy, very reliable, and a trusted friend \nto many people (AX B-1). Applicant\u2019s spouse, a licensed realtor for two and a half years, \ndescribes him as honest, open, a good husband and father, and \u201cthe most honest and \ngenerous person [she has] ever met\u201d (AX B-2).  \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from January 1998 to December \n2001, serving as an aviation electronics technician (AX A at 2). He held a security \nclearance while in the Navy (Tr. 29). His final evaluation report as a second class petty \nofficer recommended early promotion (AX C-5). His evaluation report for the period from \nNovember 23, 2000, to March 15, 2001, placed him in the \u201cmust promote\u201d category (AX \nC-6). He was awarded the Navy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the Navy \u201cE\u201d \nRibbon, a flag officer letter of commendation, and the Navy Good Conduct Medal. He \nreceived an honorable discharge (AX C-1).  \n \n \nApplicant comes from a military family. His father retired as a chief petty officer \n(E-7) after 22 years of service. His brother served four years in the Navy as an aviation \nhydraulics mechanic (Tr. 27-28).  \n \n \nApplicant worked for a federal contractor as a network administrator from \nJanuary to June 2002. He was terminated for \u201cparticipating in activities that conflict with \n[the company\u2019s] responsibilities\u201d (GX 3). The notice of termination, dated June 10, 2002, \ninformed Applicant that it was effective upon receipt, and it gave him two hours to clear \nout his personal belongings and return company equipment. According to the notice of \ntermination, Applicant used a company computer to create graphic materials and \nconduct activities related to his personal business; he was counseled about appropriate \nwork, home, and personal business-related activities on May 31, 2002 and June 3, \n2002; his emails reflected that he was engaged in personal business; and he conducted \n\u201cother activities\u201d related to his personal business on the morning of June 7, 2002. \nAttached to the notice of termination was a printout of an image found on the \u201cC\u201d drive \nof Applicant\u2019s company computer. The image included a representation of a tiger, a \nbusiness name, and a toll-free telephone number (GX 4).  \n \nOn June 26, 2002, Applicant sent an email from the \u201cbilling department\u201d of his \nprivate business to his former employer, advising that he would return the company \ntools and cut up the company credit card (GX 5 at 2). On June 28, 2002, his former \nprogram manager sent an email to his personal business address, stating that his final \ntravel and expense vouchers would not be paid until the company property was \nreturned and a criminal complaint would be filed if the property was not returned by July \n1, 2002 (GX 5 at 1). Applicant returned the company property on July 1, 2002 (GX 5 at \n5). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant told a security investigator he left this job by mutual \nagreement because of lack of work, boredom, and low pay (GX 8 at 4). His testimony at \nthe hearing was consistent with his statement to the security investigator (Tr. 39-40). He \ndescribed his departure as friendly (Tr. 41). He testified he believed he was laid off, not \nterminated for cause (Tr. 44, 55). He testified he never saw the notice of termination \nuntil he saw the investigative file in his lawyer\u2019s office (Tr. 64). Although the termination \nnotice recites that he was counseled on May 31, 2002, and on June 3, 2002, about \nappropriate work, home, and personal business-related activities, Applicant testified he \nwas never counseled about those topics (Tr. 66). \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted storing the tiger image on the \u201cC\u201d drive of his \noffice computer, but he testified he kept it as a motivational screen backdrop. He \naspired to start his own company and be an internet service provider, but it never came \nto fruition (Tr. 68). He testified the telephone number in the image was a \u201cfake number\u201d \nthat he made up, because the company did not exist (Tr. 69). He also testified he had a \ntoll-free number for a short time, but he did not think he had an active toll-free number \nwhile working for this employer (Tr. 111). He admitted the email service offered by his \nprivate business was active, and he admitted he had a personal email account that \nended with the company name, but he denied conducting personal business on his \noffice computer (Tr. 70-71). He testified the business did not exist except as an e-mail \nserver and empty web space (Tr. 77). \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Department Counsel submitted two screen prints from the web \nsite of Applicant\u2019s web server, printed on May 21, 2009, to rebut Applicant\u2019s testimony \nthat the tiger image was for a company that did not exist. The first screen print recites \nthat the company was founded in June 2000 and its materials copyrighted from 2000 to \n2006 (GX 9). The second screen print recites that the company has been in business \nsince 2000 and its materials copyrighted from 2000 to 2002. It recites the same toll-free \ntelephone number as was listed on the tiger image (GX 10).  \n \n \nIn surrebuttal to GX 9 and GX 10, Applicant stated that his web site was in the \nplanning and design stages and was not an operating business up to and including the \nlast days before he was fired. He submitted documentation that the domain name for his \ncompany was created on June 5, 2002. He stated that a new domain name is not \nenabled for 24 to 48 hours after it is created, that he was out-of-town on June 7, 2002, a \nFriday, and that he was terminated on the following Monday, June 10, 2002. He stated \nthat the copyright dates were fictitious and designed to lend credibility to the company \nby making it appear as an established company. He stated he never took any formal \nsteps toward copyrighting his materials. He denied using his company computer to \nacquire or perform any work on the website. He stated he did not recall if the toll-free \nnumber was in service before his termination. He maintained that the tiger image was \nan authorized background image on his company computer, and he denied placing any \nunauthorized or inappropriate materials on his computer (AX D). \n \n \nApplicant did not apply for unemployment benefits after he left his job in June \n2002 (Tr. 63). He worked intermittently as a truck driver until he found full-time \n\n \n5 \n \n \nemployment with a federal contractor in November 2002 (Tr. 62-63). He worked for this \nfederal contractor until May 2003.  \n \n \nApplicant changed jobs and worked for another federal contractor from May 2003 \nto March 2004. In mid-March 2004, his employer received an anonymous email alleging \nthat Applicant owned a pornographic web site that included photos of his wife, \ninappropriately talked about his wife\u2019s sexual practices and desires, provided other \nemployees with email service on his web site, had an inappropriate relationship with a \nfemale supervisor, gave his passwords to subordinates not authorized to have them so \nthat they could tend to tasks that were \u201cbeneath him,\u201d and abused and mistreated \nsubordinates (GX 2 at 4).  \n \nThe anonymous email listed the address for a web site containing an \nadvertisement for a \u201cprivate companion.\u201d The web site included a page entitled \n\u201cNaughty or Nice,\u201d containing suggestive photographs of Applicant\u2019s wife (GX 6). \nApplicant testified the web site was owned and designed by his wife (Tr. 51). His wife\u2019s \nweb site does not have the same domain name as the tiger image that was the basis for \nApplicant\u2019s termination in June 2002.  \n \nOn March 31, 2004, Applicant\u2019s employer notified the Defense Security Service \nthat Applicant had been terminated as of that date for \u201cillegally connecting to \npornographic websites\u201d at his work site (GX 2 at 1). The record does not reflect what \nevidence, if any, his employer considered other than the anonymous email. \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant told a security investigator that he resigned from this \njob because he felt he was being treated unfairly (GX 8 at 3). He testified he thought the \ncomplaint was resolved as unfounded until he was called into his manager\u2019s office and \ntold: \u201cYour services are no longer required. We need your badges.\u201d He left the \nmanager\u2019s office, contacted his immediate supervisor, and arranged to surrender his \nbadges (Tr. 48-49). \n \nApplicant denied using his office computer to create or visit the website \ncontaining the photographs of his wife. He also denied referring co-workers to the \nwebsite (Tr. 114) or using his office computer to visit any other pornographic web sites \n(Tr. 51). The record does not contain any forensic evidence indicating that he visited \npornographic web sites on his company computer. \n \n \nApplicant worked as an IT Operations Manager for another employer (not a \nfederal contractor) from March 2004 to December 2005. He was hired as a network \nadministrator and help desk leader by a federal contractor in December 2005 (Tr. 33). \nWhen he submitted his e-QIP shortly after beginning this job, he answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 22, asking if during the past seven years he had been fired, quit after being \ntold he would be fired, left by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct or \nunsatisfactory performance, or left a job for other reasons under unfavorable \ncircumstances. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAfter working for six to eight months, Applicant and his team were given duties \nwith less responsibility, and Applicant became frustrated. While working at the help \ndesk, he took off his headset and put the phone on \u201chold,\u201d blocking all incoming \ncustomer calls to the help desk. Applicant was terminated for this behavior in March \n2007 (GX 8 at 4; Tr. 36).  \n \n \nApplicant began working as a systems administrator for an information \ntechnology company in March 2007. He left that job and began working for his current \nemployer in October 2008.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was terminated from a job in June 2002 for \nconducting personal business on corporate time and using corporate resources (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), terminated in March 2004 for illegal connecting to pornographic websites while at \nwork (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and terminated for unsatisfactory performance in 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).  \nIt also alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application by answering \u201cno\u201d to \nthe question about his employment record and failing to disclose his two terminations \nunder unfavorable circumstances in June 2002 and March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Finally, it \nalleges he falsified material facts during an interview with a security investigator in \nJanuary 2008 by telling the investigator he left his employment in June 2002 because of \nlack of enough work and he resigned from his employment in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nand 1.f).  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \nFive disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \n\n \n8 \n \n \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative; \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations; [and] (4) evidence of significant misuse of \nGovernment or other employer's time or resources; and  \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his job terminations in June 2002 and March 2004 \non his security clearance application raises AG \u00b6 16(a). The information he provided to \na security investigator in January 2008 about the circumstances of his termination \nraises AG \u00b6 16(b).  \n \n \nThe termination notice dated June 10, 2002, recited that Applicant was \ncounseled about appropriate work, home, and personal business-related activities on \nMay 31, 2002 and June 3, 2002. It recites that Applicant\u2019s emails reflected that he was \nengaged in personal business, and that he was conducting \u201cother activities\u201d related to \nhis personal business on the morning of June 7, 2002. The termination action on March \n31, 2004, recites that Applicant illegally connected to pornographic websites while at \nwork. The two termination notices raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), and (e). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) through (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nThe tiger image found on Applicant\u2019s computer on June 10, 2002, is apparently \nthe basis for the allegation of computer misuse on June 7, 2002. There is no evidence \nshowing what specific conduct prompted the counseling on May 31, 2002, and June 3, \n2002. There also is no evidence of the content of the emails allegedly pertaining to \npersonal business or the \u201cother activities\u201d allegedly conducted by Applicant on the \nmorning of June 7, 2002.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about the tiger image at the hearing may not have been \ncompletely candid. He testified he \u201cmade up\u201d the toll-free telephone number on the \nimage, but the same telephone number is currently displayed on his website. He also \nadmitted deceptive business practices by displaying a misleading copyright date. On the \nother hand, he provided evidence that the web site was not registered until June 5, \n2002, negating the likelihood of any related business activity before that date.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence of Applicant\u2019s email traffic in the record. The date the tiger \nimage was placed on his computer is not established. The mere presence of the tiger \nimage on his \u201cC\u201d drive does not establish that he created, modified, or otherwise used it \nfor anything other than a computer screen backdrop. I conclude Applicant has rebutted \nthe facts underlying SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination in March 2004 was for connecting to pornographic web \nsites. The only evidence of the basis for this termination is the anonymous email. There \nis nothing in the record reflecting what additional evidence, if any, his employer \nconsidered. The website address identified in the anonymous email is not the same as \nthe domain name for the tiger image. Applicant identified the website in the anonymous \nletter as one owned and designed by his wife. He denied visiting pornographic websites \non his company computer, and there is no evidence in the record contradicting his \ndenial. As in the case of his June 2002 termination, there is no evidence of his email \ntraffic or evidence of websites he visited. I conclude Applicant has rebutted the facts \nunderlying SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nApplicant admitted the misconduct which was the basis for his termination in \n2006. His admission in his response to the SOR and at the hearing is sufficient to \nestablish the facts underlying SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \n \nRegardless of whether Applicant\u2019s two terminations in June 2002 and March \n2004 were justified by the evidence, two issues must be resolved: (1) was he terminated \nunder unfavorable conditions? and (2) did he know he had been terminated under \nunfavorable conditions? \n \n \nOn its face, the termination letter dated June 10, 2002, is clear and unequivocal. \nIt was effective on receipt, and it gave Applicant two hours to clear out his personal \n\n \n10 \n \n \nbelongings and return company equipment. It was followed by an email threatening \nlegal action if he did not return all company equipment. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony \nthat he never received the termination notice implausible and not credible. I am satisfied \nthat he was terminated for cause and knew it. I conclude the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.d \nare supported by substantial evidence and have not been refuted. \n \n \nThere is no evidence of a written notice to Applicant regarding his termination in \nMarch 2004. The documentary evidence establishes only that Applicant\u2019s employer \nnotified the Defense Security Service that he had been terminated for cause. Applicant \ntestified, however, that he initially was informed the allegations against him were \nunfounded, but he was then called into the corporate office and told: \u201cYour services are \nno longer required. We need your badges.\u201d I am satisfied Applicant knew he had been \nterminated under unfavorable conditions. I conclude the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e are \nsupported by substantial evidence and have not been refuted.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication or during a security interview may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition \nis not established because Applicant has never attempted to correct the falsifications.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant has left three jobs for federal contractors under unfavorable circumstances. \nWhile the basis for Applicant\u2019s first two terminations may be questionable, his third \ntermination clearly was justified. He falsified his security clearance application in \nDecember 2005, repeated his falsifications during a security interview in January 2008, \nand persisted in his falsifications at the hearing. His misconduct was serious, recent, \nfrequent, and did not happen under unique circumstances. It raises doubts about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e). The termination notice of June 2002 contained numerous allegations of computer \nmisuse and two counseling sessions related to computer misuse. Except for the tiger \nimage, there is no evidence showing the factual basis for the allegations. While the \ntermination may have been justified, the record does not reflect what evidence \nApplicant\u2019s employer considered. The evidence presented at the hearing falls short of \n\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of misconduct. To the extent that the termination notice of March \n2004 relied solely on an anonymous email, it was based on evidence of \u201cquestionable \nreliability.\u201d While Applicant\u2019s employer may have considered other evidence in addition \nto the anonymous email, no such evidence was presented at the hearing. I conclude AG \n\u00b6 17(e) is applicable. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under this \nguideline. Since Applicant rebutted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, the \nallegations under this guideline are resolved in his favor. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has served honorably in the U.S. Navy, worked \nfor a succession of federal contractors, and held a clearance for many years. The \njustifications for his terminations in June 2002 and March 2004 are somewhat \nquestionable, but the record reflects that the circumstances in both instances were \nunfavorable. While he may have felt he was treated unfairly, any unfairness does not \njustify his lack of candor during the security clearance process. After weighing the \nrelevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns based on his personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M  \n(Use of Information Technology Systems): \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 21,\n2007. On October 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nH for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 20, 2008, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s written case on January 22, 2009. Applicant received a complete file\nof relevant material (FORM) on January 26, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to\nfile objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s\nFebruary 17, 2009\n\nThe Government submitted five items in support of its contentions.\n1\n2\ncase.  Applicant submitted additional information in a timely manner. The case was\n1\nassigned to me on February 10, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, signed November 4, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegation in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support\nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school and obtained his college degree in August 1973. He is married and has one\nchild. He has worked as a designer/project manager for his current employer since\nAugust 2002 (Item 1).\nApplicant used marijuana from about January 1990 until about May 2007. He\nadmitted that he used approximately six to twelve times. He stated that his marijuana\nuse may continue in the future. He used the illegal drug with friends on \u201cgame nights.\u201d\n(Item 5) Applicant was interviewed in March 2008. During the interview he stated he\nsmoked approximately 1-2 puffs of a marijuana cigarette. He admitted that he would use\nwhenever the opportunity presented itself at his friends\u2019 homes. \nApplicant used marijuana in the beginning out of curiosity. He believes he is not\naffected by the use. He has never been arrested or charged for any drug related\noffenses (Item 4).\nIn his response to June 2008 interrogatories, Applicant explained that he failed to\nmention that in 2006 he ate a brownie laced with marijuana which gave him an\n\u201cuncomfortable reaction.\u201d He advised that he doubted that he would use the drug again\n(Item 5). This statement is inconsistent with his security application and his answer to\nthe SOR.\nApplicant submitted a statement in response to the FORM. He advised that he\nwanted his application stamped \u201cNot Approved.\u201d He explained that he answered all the\nsecurity clearance questions truthfully and contends that his record is no worse and\nmuch better than some in much higher governmental positions. He also elaborated that\nhe did not want a security clearance. He filled out the paperwork as a courtesy to his\nemployer.\nApplicant expressly stated that the entire process involving a security clearance\nis \u201cdemeaning.\u201d He compared his trustworthiness in regard to drug use with senior\nGovernment officials who may use drugs. He does not believe that the Government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns over his drug use are worthwhile. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s employer rates him as a \u201cstellar employee.\u201d They believe that it would\nbe a great benefit to the company if Applicant had a security clearance.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n4\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant admitted his use of marijuana from 1970 until at least May 2007. The multiple\nuse is sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nadmitted May 2007 use of marijuana is recent. He has used marijuana since 1990 and\nuntil at least approximately two years ago. Considering Applicant has used marijuana\nover a period of 17 years, his conduct should not be deemed infrequent. This mitigating\ncondition does not apply. He expressed a clear disdain for the security clearance\nprocess. His inconsistent explanation as to future illegal drug use casts doubt on his\ntrustworthiness, reliability and judgment. I do not find that this mitigating condition\napplies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where Aa demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d Applicant uses marijuana with friends on\nsocial occasions. He stated in his March 2008 interview that he would use marijuana if\nan opportunity presents itself. Though he stated he doubted he would use marijuana\nagain in response to June 2008 interrogatories, his inconsistent explanations as to\nfuture use are not credible and cast doubt on his trustworthiness, reliability and\njudgment. I do not find that these mitigating conditions apply.  \n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. He has a long history of smoking marijuana. He admitted using with\nfriends at social occasions and may do so in the future. His recent decision to stop\nusing marijuana because he became ill in 2006 contradicts his Answer to the SOR. In\nFebruary 2008 he stated that \u201cif an opportunity to smoke marijuana presents itself and I\nwant to do it, I will.\u201d This undercuts any claim that he has expressed a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse drugs in the future. In addition, Applicant expressed a lack of respect\nfor the security clearance process. He appears to lack the understanding about the\nGovernment\u2019s concern over drug abuse. Finally, Applicant provided a handwritten\nstatement on his Answer that he finds the security clearance process \u201cdemeaning.\u201d I\nfind that the lack of understanding of the process undercuts any confidence the\nGovernment would have in his reliability and judgment.  \nApplicant has a long employment record. He voluntarily reported his marijuana\nuse on his security application. I considered his stellar rating as an employee with his\ncompany. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n6\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough \nreview of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old software engineer (Tr. 52) who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nCoworkers state Applicant is extremely personable, dependable, open and honest. \nApplicant is very hard working. (Ex. A)  \n \n \nApplicant was born in India. In 1985, he came to the U.S. as a student. He \nattended a university college of engineering from 1985 to 1991. He obtained a Master of \nScience degree in electrical engineering and computer science. In 1992, he met his wife \nwhile on vacation in India and they married the same year. (Tr. 24) His wife is a quality \ncontrol chemist for a pharmaceutical company who has a Master\u2019s degree in chemistry. \n(Tr. 24) In November 2001, both he and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens. In \nDecember 2001, Applicant obtained a U.S. passport. (Ex. C) In 2004, his Indian \npassport expired. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are naturalized U.S. citizens who live the majority of the year \nin India. His father was a partner in a firm that made high voltage equipment. (Tr. 27) In \n1987, he retired from the company. Applicant\u2019s mother is a housewife. None of his \nrelatives or in-laws work for or have worked for the Indian government or any other \nforeign government. Applicant previously had weekly contact with them, but now his \ncontact is once a month. (Tr. 27) In 1996, his parents obtained their green card, \npermanent resident status. In 2003, they obtained their U.S. citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother was born in India, came to the U.S. in 1989, is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, and currently works in India as a business analyst. His brother \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n \n \n2\n\nand his sister-in-law worked for a U.S. company in California before they accepted a \ncompany transfer to India. They currently work for the same company in India. Their \nchildren were born in the U.S. (Tr. 33) They own a house in California and it is their \nintention to return to the U.S. (Tr. 31)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen who owns a software \nbusiness in California. His older brother has two children born in the U.S. (Tr. 35) \nApplicant talks with his brother weekly. His older brother was the first of the family to \ncome to the U.S. Applicant has aunts and uncles in India that he contacts less than \nonce a year. (Tr. 50)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, a housewife, is a citizen and resident of India who has \nvisited Applicant and his wife in the U.S. four times. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law was a \ntextile engineer before his death in 1995. (Tr. 41, 54) Applicant\u2019s wife calls her mother \nonce a week. (Tr. 47) Applicant\u2019s wife has one brother. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law had \nbeen living with his wife\u2019s brother prior to his move to the U.S. (Tr. 40) In 2007, \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother, a business analyst, and Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law came to the \nU.S. Applicant talks to his brother-in-law once every two weeks. (Tr. 40) Applicant\u2019s \nsister-in-law is a U.S. citizen. They are employed in the U.S. Their son,  \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s nephew, is an Indian citizen.  \n \nApplicant traveled to India in January 2001, January 2005, and December \n2006\u2014 January 2007. When he traveled to India, he visited relatives and in-laws, in \nIndia. His travel to India was facilitated by an Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) card \nhe obtained in 2006. (Ex. D) The Constitution of India does not allow holding Indian \ncitizenship and citizenship of a foreign country simultaneously. (Ex. 3) The OCI serves \nas a lifetime visa to visit India. The card allows the holder to enter India at anytime and \nstay in India as long as the person desires. With the card, the holder is not required to \nobtain a visa prior to traveling to India. (Ex. 2) Applicant submitted an Indian Form XXII \nrenunciation of his overseas citizenship of India. (Ex. E) Applicant\u2019s OCI card has been \ncancelled. (Ex. F)  \n \nIn 2005 and 2007, Applicant visited his wife\u2019s schoolmate and her husband, \ncitizens of India, living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). His wife\u2019s friend is a \nhousewife and his wife\u2019s friend\u2019s husband is a project manager for an engineering \ncompany. (Tr. 47, 48, Ex. 2) Applicant and his wife would visit her wife\u2019s friend because \nthe aircraft stopped in the UAE on its return trip to the U.S. Now there are direct flights \nfrom India to the U.S. and Applicant and his wife no longer stop in the UAE. Applicant\u2019s \nwife contacts her friend in the UAE once every six months. (Tr. 49)  \n \n \nIn 1998, ten years ago, Applicant purchased a home in the U.S. (Tr. 42) His \nhome has a fair market value of $300,000 and Applicant has equity of $150,000. (Tr. 43, \nEx. F) Applicant has $150,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan. He has no property or \nfinancial interest in India or any foreign country. (Ex. 2) Applicant has no financial \nobligations to any of his relatives. (Tr. 29, Ex. 2)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to India, along with 13 attachments. The facts administratively \nnoticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to \nreasonable dispute. Those facts are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \n \nIndia \n \nI have taken administrative notice that India is not hostile to the U.S. nor are its \ninterests inimical to the United States. The U.S. and India enjoy good relations. The \nUnited States is India's largest trading partner. India=s size, population, and strategic \nlocation give it a prominent voice in international affairs, and its growing industrial base, \nmilitary strength, and scientific and technical capacity on issues from trade to \nenvironmental protection.  \n \nThe U.S. recognizes India as key to strategic interests and has sought to \nstrengthen its relationship with India. The two countries are the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracies, both committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment, and share common interests in the free flow of commerce, in fighting \nterrorism, and in creating a strategically stable Asia. However, differences over India\u2019s \nnuclear weapons program and pace of economic reform exist. There are also concerns \nabout India\u2019s relations with Iran, including India\u2019s increasing cooperation with the Iranian \nmilitary. \n \nAccording to its constitution, India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic \nrepublic. It is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament \nand a population of approximately 1.1 billion people.  \n \nAlthough the Indian government generally respects the human rights of its \ncitizens, there remained numerous serious problems and significant human rights \nabuses. Police and security forces have engaged in extrajudicial killings of persons in \ncustody, disappearances, torture, and rape. The lack of accountability permeated the \ngovernment and security forces, creating an atmosphere in which human rights \nviolations went unpunished. A number of violent attacks have been committed in recent \nyears by separatist and terrorist groups. \n \n \nThere have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India, including technology and equipment which \nwere determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Foreign \ngovernment entities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have \ncapitalized on private-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive \nU.S. technology by foreign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments \nor its use in military applications. \n \n \nThe U.S. views India as a growing world power with which it shares common \nstrategic interests. There is a strong partnership between the two countries and they are \n \n \n \n4\n\nexpected to continue to address differences and shape a dynamic and collaborative \nfuture. The U.S. and India are seeking to elevate the strategic partnership further to \ninclude cooperation in counter-terrorism, defense cooperation, education, and joint \ndemocracy promotion. \n \nThe United States government encourages small and medium size companies to \nexpand their business opportunities in India. Many United States based companies, \nincluding large computer service and software development companies, have subsidiary \ncompanies and do business in India. \n \nWhile there is a threat of terrorism in India, as well as in most areas of the world, \nthe area of India where Applicant=s family resides is not listed as an area of safety or \nsecurity concern, or of instability because of terrorism.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \n \n \n \n5\n\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes thee conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;2 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n                                                          \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n \n \n \n6\n\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with his parents and younger brother, who are \nU.S. naturalized citizens living in India. Applicant\u2019s older brother is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen living in California. His wife has weekly contact with her mother. Applicant has \nless frequent contacts with his aunts, uncles, mother-in-law, and other in-laws. \nHowever, these relationships with family members create a heightened risk of foreign \npressure or exploitation because entities in India have sought U. S. intelligence or \nproprietary information. His connections to his family also create a potential conflict of \ninterest because the relationship with his brother and parents are sufficiently close in \nnature and could raise a security concern over his desire to help his family.  \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. Three of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c) have some application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with his \nparents, brother, his in-laws, and his wife\u2019s friend. None of those relatives are in \npositions connected with the Indian government or engaged in activities that would likely \ncause Applicant to be exploited or placed in a position of having to choose between \nthem and the United States. Applicant\u2019s contact with his parents is once a month, but it \nis not clear that the contacts are so casual that they could not create any risk of foreign \ninfluence. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) applies to his wife\u2019s friend from school and her husband who live in the \nUAE. Applicant has visited them twice with the last visit in 2007. With a change in air \nplane schedules, Applicant\u2019s travel to and from India no longer involves a stop in the \nUAE. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s contact with his wife\u2019s friend will become even less \nfrequent.  \n \n \n \n7\n\n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of U.S. interests. He has lived in the United States since 1985 when he \narrived to attend university. After earning his degree and advanced degree, he began \nworking here. In 2001, he became a U.S. citizen as did his wife. Both of his children \nwere born in the U.S. In contrast, his ties to India have become minimal over the years. \nHe has substantial U.S. property. He renounced his Indian citizenship and does not \nhave any financial or property interests there. He has infrequent communication with his \naunt and uncles, living there. Since 2001, he visited India three times for recreational \npurposes, the last visit occurring two years ago.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Under the whole \nperson concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning India must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in that country, as well as the dangers existing in India.3 While \nthere is no evidence India is a known collector of U.S. intelligence and sensitive \neconomic information, there have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted \nillegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to India. Foreign government \nentities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have capitalized on \nprivate-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive U.S. \ntechnology by foreign private entities does to slow it flow to foreign governments or its \nuse in military applications.  \n                                                          \n3 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n \n \n8\n\n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; \nand many other [factors] raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 \nat 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). Substantial mitigating evidence weighs towards granting \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \n \nIt has been two years since Applicant traveled to India. His ties to his parents, \nbrother, and in-laws are limited to telephone calls for family news. His communications \nestablish ties of affection to his Indian family members. There is some possibility that \nApplicant could be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates, especially because India has a significant lawless element, who may attempt to \nharm Applicant\u2019s relatives to gain some kind of advantage over Applicant.  \n \nApplicant is a mature person. He has lived in the United States for more than 23 \nyears, and has been a naturalized citizen for the past eight. Applicant\u2019s spouse has \nbeen living in the United States since 1992 and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. His two \nchildren were born in the United States. He earned a degree and an advanced degree \nfrom a U.S. institution. He is a successful member of his business community, providing \nservices to the U.S. government. His ties to the United States are much stronger than \nhis ties to his relatives living in India. His parents and brothers are all U.S. citizens.  \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United States seriously. \nHis Indian citizenship was renounced by taking his U.S. oath of citizenship. India does \nnot recognize dual citizenship. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s OCI card has been cancelled. \nThere is not any derogatory information about him in the record. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence.4 Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:  FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.h:   \nFor Applicant \n                                                          \n4 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person \nanalysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n \n \n \n \n9\n\n \n \n \n10\n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s security clearance is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He was caught and resigned to avoid termination. He misled two \ninvestigators and falsified his Security Clearance Application (SF-86) about leaving his \nemployment under adverse circumstances. Personal conduct concerns are not \nmitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 18, 2005, Applicant submitted an SF-86 (e-QIP version) (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1). On October 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, alleging security concerns under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct (GE 9). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \nSeptember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 3, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (GE 10). On March 24, 2009, DOHA issued an Amended \nSOR to Applicant adding two additional Guideline E allegations. On April 2, 2009, \nApplicant responded to the Amended SOR (Transcript (Tr.) 13-15; GE 13). \n \nOn March 25, 2009, Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On April 2, \n2009, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. On May 4, 2009, the case \nwas transferred to me for caseload reasons. On May 8, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing \nnotice setting the hearing for June 15, 2009 (GE 8). The hearing was held on June 15, \n2009, as scheduled.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) (Tr. 24-26), \nand Applicant offered 11 exhibits (Tr. 89-92; AE A-P). Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to \nthe admissibility of the summaries of Applicant\u2019s interviews taken on February 21, 2008, \nand November 17, 2008. I overruled the objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 25-26, \n54, 72, 74). Department Counsel objected to admissibility of documents relating to \nApplicant\u2019s sleep disorder because of lack of relevance to the SOR allegations; and \nbecause two Wikipedia articles (AE H, I) have low reliability (Tr. 92-93, 115). I overruled \nthe objections and admitted AE A-P (Tr. 93, 115). Additionally, I admitted the hearing \nnotice, SOR, response to the SOR, designation of attorney, and entry of appearance \n(GE 8-12). I also admitted the SOR amendment and Applicant\u2019s response to \namendment of the SOR (GE 13). On June 23, 2009, I received the hearing transcript.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted in his SOR response that he mischarged the hours on his \ntimecard, and he resigned in April 2007 prior to administration of disciplinary action \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a; GE 10). He denied the remainder of the SOR allegations (GE 10). His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old test and evaluation engineer employed by a defense \ncontractor (Tr. 141-142). His primary responsibility is software integration testing (Tr. \n142). He started working for his current employer (N) in October 2007 (Tr. 143, 158). \n \nApplicant received the Eagle Scout award when he was 13 years old (Tr. 144; \nAE B). In February 2005, he graduated from one of the top engineering universities in \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthe United States (Tr. 145; AE A). He received an award from a university for an aircraft \ndesign (Tr. 145-146; AE C). In college, Applicant had problems with oversleeping and \nmissing class as well as falling asleep during class (Tr. 146-147). In July 2005, he \nbegan his first employment after college with R, a large defense contractor (Tr. 148).     \n \nFalsification of time cards and resignation from employment (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n  \n \nApplicant had difficulty getting to work on time (Tr. 149). Sometimes he could not \nwake up until 3:00 pm (Tr. 149). Self-help strategies, such as multiple alarm clocks, \nspecial pillows, a special mattress, and vitamin supplements, were not successful in \nApplicant awakening and getting to work on time (Tr. 149-150). In January 2007, O, his \nadministrative supervisor at R, placed Applicant on a performance improvement plan \n(PIP) (Tr. 151-152). Failure to improve under the PIP was possible grounds for \ntermination (Tr. 196). He told O he was having trouble sleeping (Tr. 152-153). He was \nrequired to be at work by 9:00 am (Tr. 152). \n \nOn April 18, 2007, O told Applicant that R\u2019s badge reader was inconsistent with \nthe time he provided on his time cards (Tr. 153, 198; GE 3). He admitted that the hours \nhe reported on his time cards were not the hours he actually worked (Tr. 153; GE 3). He \nclaimed on his time cards that he worked 40 hours a week; however, he did not actually \nwork 40 hours (Tr. 197). He claimed he worked eight hours each day; however, in \nreality he worked less (Tr. 197). He provided false time cards to conceal that he was \ncoming in late for work, and he did not want to be terminated from his employment (Tr. \n154).   \n \nO told Applicant that based on his past good performance he would be permitted \nto resign before they pursued termination (Tr. 154). Applicant chose to resign and he \nleft employment with R at the end of the week (Tr. 199, 201). His technical supervisors \nat R described his work in positive terms (Tr. 155-157). O said the circumstances of his \ndeparture would remain confidential within R (Tr. 155, 200). No other employees at R \nwere supposed to know about his true reasons for leaving employment at R (Tr. 158).  \nApplicant resigned from R effective April 20, 2007 (Tr. 206-207; GE 3). If not for the \ntime-card fraud, he would not have resigned from R on April 20, 2007 (Tr. 207).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sleep disorder \n \n \nA highly-qualified medical doctor (M), who is board certified in internal medicine \nand sleep disorders medicine, examined Applicant and diagnosed him as suffering from \ndelayed-sleep phase syndrome (Tr. 94-98, 172; AE E, F).2 Applicant has had this \nmedical problem for many years, and it contributed to his excessive daytime sleepiness \n(Tr. 98). Applicant had great difficulty falling asleep at night and then he would \noversleep the next morning (Tr. 98-99). M thoroughly described the testing process and \nmethods, including drug therapy and sleeping/light strategies, to reduce the impact of \nthe symptoms of delayed-sleep phase syndrome (Tr. 99-121; AE D, G, I, J). Applicant is \n \n2 I accepted a stipulation that Applicant suffers from this disorder (Tr. 173-174). \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nnow able to get to work around 11:00 am, and then he works for the next eight hours \n(Tr. 160). He has never submitted false time cards at his current employment (Tr. 160).  \n \nAllegation of providing false information to an investigator (SOR \u00b6 1.b)  \n \nOn May 7, 2007, R made a JPAS entry indicating that on April 19, 2007, \nApplicant admitted falsifying his time cards to O (Tr. 215; GE 4). On February 21, 2008, \nan Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Issue Resolution (IR) Investigator received \na tasking from her office to interview Applicant (Tr. 39, 47-48). The purpose of her \ninterview was to determine the reason Applicant left his employment with R (Tr. 39). \nShe believed that she asked Applicant why he was terminated from his employment \nwith R (Tr. 47-48).3 She did not know the actual reason he was terminated from his \nemployment with R (Tr. 48). The OPM IR investigator interviewed Applicant for about 30 \nminutes (Tr. 27-53; SOR \u00b6 1.b; GE 2, 10). During her interview, the OPM IR investigator \ntook notes and then used the notes to generate a summary of the interview (Tr. 42).4 \nThe notes were destroyed 90 days after the interview (Tr. 42). The OPM IR investigator \nprepared and transmitted her report the next day (Tr. 32). Applicant told the OPM IR \ninvestigator that he left his employment with the defense contractor on good terms \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b; GE 10). The OPM IR investigator only had a vague recollection of the \ninterview because it was about 18 months previously, and she conducts 30 interviews \nper month (Tr. 29).   \n \nApplicant objected to the OPM IR investigator\u2019s authentication of her report \nbecause she could not recall the interview or preparing her report. I overruled the \nobjection because she recognized a code she used to submit the report (which required \nher password). More importantly, in his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant \nreviewed and adopted the OPM IR investigator\u2019s summary of interview. This adoption is \nadmissible because it constitutes a party admission. See Generally Federal Rule of \nEvidence 801(d)(2)(B) (stating, \u201ca statement of which the party has manifested an \nadoption or belief in its truth\u201d). Applicant provided written corrections concerning dates, \nspellings of names, and some other facts in the summary of his interview (GE 2). \nApplicant concluded, aside from his corrections, \u201call other information is correct\u201d (GE \n \n3 She did not have a copy of her tasking, and could not specifically remember what it said. She \nassumed the contents of the tasking from her interview summary (Tr. 50). The interview summary begins, \n\u201cSubject was interviewed in person on February 21, 2008, to discuss termination of employment\u201d (GE 2). \nThe material information from the summary is that she asked Applicant why he left employment from R, \nand he did not tell her anything about committing time-card fraud and he failed to explain that he resigned \nafter being threatened with termination. \n \n4 The OPM IR investigator erroneously stated her handwritten notes were \u201cword-for-word\u201d as \nopposed to a summary; however, she does not take shorthand and did not provide any other convincing \ninformation to support her claim of being able to make such comprehensive notes of her interview (Tr. 43, \n48). The OPM IR investigator also said Applicant \u201cswore that he was telling the truth\u201d (Tr. 43). She also \nsaid she starts the interview by advising the interviewee that the statement is an \u201cunsworn declaration,\u201d \nthe importance that the interview be truthful, and about the applicability of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (Tr. 44, 52-\n53). The summary of interview indicates it is an \u201cunsworn declaration\u201d (GE 2). Later, she corrected her \nstatement at the hearing to indicate it was an unsworn interview (Tr. 45).    \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n2).5 I accepted all of Applicant\u2019s corrections as information he provided to the \ninvestigator.  \n  \nApplicant claimed that he did not willfully provide false information to the OPM IR \ninvestigator (Tr. 176). He said he thought he left on good terms because his task \nleaders were happy with his work, and the true reason for his departure would remain \nconfidential (Tr. 176, 179). In his August 1, 2008, response to DOHA interrogatories, he \nincluded O\u2019s name as his supervisor for administrative purposes and cited other \nemployees as his day-to-day supervisors (Tr. 177; GE 2).    \n \nAllegation of providing false information on his SF-86 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \nOn September 30, 2008, Applicant completed an SF-86, which includes the \nfollowing question:  \n \nQuestion 22. Your Employment Record Has any of the following \nhappened to you in the last 7 years? \n \n1. Fired from a job. \n \n2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired. \n \n3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct.  \n \n4. Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.  \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d At his hearing, he denied that he willfully provided \nfalse information in response to question 22 (Tr. 179-180). He said he thought he left R \non good terms, and R would record his departure as a resignation (Tr. 180). He thought \nR would not inform the government about why he left employment with R (Tr. 203). It \nwas Applicant\u2019s intention to inform the government that he left employment with R on \ngood terms (Tr. 204).   \n \nAllegation of providing false information to an investigator (SOR \u00b6 1.d)  \n \nOn November 17, 2008, a DoD investigator interviewed Applicant for about an \nhour (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. 60-72, 74; GE 6).6 The interview summary encompassed seven \n \n5 In ISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 25, 2009) the Appeal Board discussed the \nright to confront witnesses under the Directive in connection with police investigative reports. See also \nISCR Case No. 07-14939 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2009) (citing authentication of Applicant\u2019s interview \nusing a DOHA interrogatory); ISCR Case No. 07-10804 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008) (same). \n \n6The investigator made notes during Applicant\u2019s interview and then generated a summary of \ninterview 24 to 48 hours later (Tr. 66-67). She did not have any independent recollection of the content of \nthe interview and relied on her standard interview practices (Tr. 67-69). Applicant objected to admissibility \nof the interview (Tr. 66-72). I overruled the objection (Tr. 72). The interviewer\u2019s lack of recollection of the \nspecific interview goes to the weight given the summary and not its admissibility. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ntyped pages (Tr. 76; GE 6). She did not focus the interview on why Applicant left his \nprevious employment (Tr. 71). She asked standard questions about leaving \nemployment (Tr. 71). Applicant told the investigator that he resigned under favorable \nconditions from employment with the defense contractor; he is eligible for rehire; and his \nresignation was for personal reasons relating to his desire to relocate to the same \nlocation where his girlfriend resides (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He did not disclose that he resigned \nafter admitting mischarging hours on his timecard (SOR \u00b6 1.d).     \n   \nOn November 18, 2008, Applicant telephoned the investigator (J), who \ninterviewed him the previous day (Tr. 77, 184, 212; GE 7). Applicant told J that a \nsecurity guard employed by contractor N informed Applicant that he left R\u2019s employment \nunder unfavorable conditions (Tr. 79).7 Applicant disclosed that O,8 one of his \nsupervisors at R, gave him the option of voluntary resignation or the R would terminate \nhim because Applicant made a mistake on his timecard, which O considered fraud (Tr. \n79).9 R\u2019s employment record would reflect his voluntary resignation, and the reasons for \nhis termination would be kept confidential and private (Tr. 79). Applicant said it was his \nunderstanding that he was not required to disclose the reasons for his termination (Tr. \n80). He called the investigator because he felt it was his duty to disclose all of the \nrelevant information once he realized R had provided the unfavorable circumstances \nsurrounding his resignation (Tr. 188).     \n \nOn December 30, 2008, J conducted a follow-up interview of Applicant (Tr. 81-\n87; GE 7). Applicant disclosed his sleeping disorder, and that he was placed on a \nperformance plan because of his tardiness (Tr. 86-87). Applicant admitted he \n\u201cinaccurately reported the hours he worked\u201d on his time card at R, and then he agreed \nwith J that it was time-card fraud (Tr. 82-85; GE 7). \n \nCharacter recommendations and performance evaluations \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor (S) at N since October 2007 does not evaluate \nApplicant\u2019s work performance (Tr. 125, 126,139). Applicant and S occasionally socialize \noutside the workplace (Tr. 135, 136). They work very closely together on information \ntechnology problems, services, and support (Tr. 126-127). Applicant has an unusual \nwork schedule, as a work-place accommodation because of his sleep disorder (Tr. 128-\n129). He is allowed to arrive late for work and to work late (Tr. 128-131). Applicant said \n \n7 On November 18, 2008, Applicant received the SOR from his security officer at N (Tr. 183, 212-\n213). Applicant immediately called the investigator to correct his statement at his interview (Tr. 184). \n \n8 When Applicant applied for employment with N, he provided as references the names of several \nformer supervisors at R that were aware of his technical expertise and that were all satisfied with his work \n(Tr. 210-211, 218). However, he did not provide O\u2019s name (Tr. 159). O was in charge of time cards, leave, \nand other administrative matters at R (Tr. 210-211). The first time Applicant disclosed that O was one of \nhis supervisors at R was after he received the SOR (Tr. 192). He did not believe the other points of \ncontact he provided at R were aware of the reasons (time-card fraud and the threat to initiate termination) \nthat he left employment at R (Tr. 190-192).   \n   \n9 Applicant agreed with the accuracy of the summary of interview, except he said he falsified the \ntime cards as opposed to merely making a mistake on his time cards (Tr. 187). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhe left employment with R because he had problems with his time card; however, he \nalso said he left on good terms when he resigned from R (Tr. 133). Applicant told S that \nhe thought the time-card related reasons he left employment with R were to remain \nconfidential (Tr. 134). Applicant is a trustworthy, top-notch professional (Tr. 130, 135). \nApplicant is a great employee and team player (Tr. 136).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation at N for 2007 to 2008 notes he has had \ndifficulty with arriving to work on time (Tr. 162; AE N). His performance evaluation at N \nfor 2008 to 2009 has all favorable comments and does not cite a problem with tardiness \n(Tr. 163-164; AE O). Applicant worked with great diligence and dedication, sometimes \naround the clock, to support customers (Tr. 165). He received a $2,000 award from N \nfor meeting a particularly difficult deadline (Tr. 167-168; AE K). He also received pay \nincreases (Tr. 168-169; AE L, M). He informed his supervisors at N about why he left \nemployment at R (Tr. 170).    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline E (personal conduct) \nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of:  .  .  .   (3) a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer, R, placed him on a PIP because of his tardiness. Applicant \nsuffered from delayed-sleep phase syndrome, which often caused him to oversleep and \nto be late for work. From November 2006 to April 2007, Applicant submitted false time \ncards to R to conceal his tardiness. His submissions constituted fraud, as he claimed \nand was paid for more hours than he actually worked. O, his supervisor at R, confronted \nApplicant with the evidence of his fraudulent activity, and offered to let Applicant resign \nin lieu of termination. Applicant accepted this offer. His multiple submissions of false \ntime cards establish AG \u00b6 16(d)(3). \n \nOn February 21, 2008, and November 17, 2008, Applicant told government \ninvestigators conducting security-related investigations that he left employment with R \non positive or favorable terms. He did not disclose the true reasons he left employment \nwith R. On September 30, 2008, Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to the questions on his SF-\n86 about whether he \u201c[q]uit a job after being told [he would] be fired,\u201d and \u201c[l]eft a job by \nmutual agreement following allegations of misconduct.\u201d He intentionally provided false \ninformation to security investigators and on his SF-86. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both \napply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant made statements on \nFebruary 21, 2008, and November 17, 2008, to government investigators conducting \nsecurity-related investigations, and on September 30, 2008, he signed his SF-86. He \nadmitted he told the investigators he left employment with R on good terms, and he did \nnot disclose to the investigators and on his SF-86 that he resigned in lieu of termination \nfor time-card fraud. He said he did not provide the true reasons for leaving employment \nwith R because O told him the time-card fraud would be kept confidential.10 I found his \nstatement at the hearing about his reasons for providing false information to be credible. \nHe honestly thought R would keep his misconduct confidential. However, immediately \nupon receipt of the SOR, he realized R had not kept the time-card fraud information \n \n10The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \u201cWhen an applicant claims that a false answer to a [SF-86] question is not deliberate, the Judge \nshould address explicitly any contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 08-07998 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 12, 2009) (citing ISCR Case No. 07-03307 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2008)). \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nconfidential. After he received the SOR, he called an investigator and truthfully \ndisclosed the real reasons for leaving employment with R.   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) all partially apply. Applicant suffers from delayed-\nsleep phase syndrome, and being extremely tired affected his judgment. His medical \nproblem provides some important extenuation. He has recently received medical \ntreatment for delayed-sleep phase syndrome. He is now able to better accommodate \nhis lifestyle and employment to address his medical problem. He understands the \nimportance of honesty and integrity in his government-related employment. He has \nacknowledged the misconduct and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior. His disclosure of his \nmisconduct, and medical assistance for delayed-sleep phase syndrome are important \n\u201cpositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, [and] \nduress.\u201d  \n \nIn conclusion, however, Applicant\u2019s conduct cannot be fully mitigated under \nGuideline E because the fraudulent activity to conceal his tardiness and subsequent \nfalsification to conceal his time-card misconduct continue to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His most recent falsification was on November 17, \n2008, and it is simply too serious to mitigate at this time. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe whole person factors supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they are insufficient to warrant approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance at this time. Applicant graduated from one of the top United States technical \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nuniversities. His supervisors noted Applicant\u2019s excellent performance. He received \nfinancial awards and substantial pay raises from his current employer. He admitted his \ntime-card fraud, and that he failed to provide information about resigning in lieu of \ntermination to investigators and on his SF-86. He has delayed-sleep phase syndrome, \nwhich affected his employment at R. Being exceptionally tired affected his judgment, \nand I do not believe he would make such poor decisions now that he has identified his \nmedical problem and is receiving treatment. He is now able to better accommodate his \nlifestyle and employment to address his medical problem. Now that the government is \nwell-aware of his time-card fraud, and subsequent falsifications, his motive to conceal \nthese particular acts of misconduct and vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation and \nduress have been eliminated. Applicant is an intelligent, capable, reliable, dedicated, \nand trustworthy employee.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant submitted false time cards from November 2006 to April 2007. He was paid \nfor hours he did not work. There is no evidence he reimbursed his employer. He \nresigned in lieu of termination and received a promise of confidentiality. He provided \nfalse information to two investigators conducting security-related investigations, and he \nfalsified his SF-86. The promise of confidentiality facilitated his scheme to conceal his \nmisconduct. His misconduct cannot be mitigated at this time. The falsifications were \nknowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. Falsification of a security clearance application shows a \nlack of trustworthiness and poor judgment. Such conduct goes to the heart of the \nclearance process, and a security clearance is not warranted at this time.     \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors,\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a set of written\ninterrogatories regarding potentially adverse information in his background. Based on\nthe results of the background investigation and his response to the interrogatories,\nDOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s clearance. On\nOctober 31, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nNovember 4, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

The case was assigned to me on June 23, 2009. Pursuant to a Notice of\nHearing issued on July 6, 2009, I convened a hearing on July 30, 2009, at which the\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four evidentiary exhibits\nincluded in the record without objection as Gx. 1 - 4. The government also proffered four\ndocuments for purposes of administrative notice, which were included in the record as\njudicial exhibits (Jx.) I - IV.  Applicant testified and submitted four exhibits admitted\n3\nwithout objection as Ax. A - D. Also included in the record are 10 documents attached to\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR.  DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on\n4\nAugust 7, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe single allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in this case is as follows:\nOn or about January 15, 2004, you were investigated for using your\ngovernment computer to improperly and without authorization, access\ncomputer systems at [an American military installation], for having\ninstalled on your computer inappropriate and non-sanctioned software,\nand having downloaded to your assigned computer\u2019s hard-drive classified\ninformation regarding contracts for which you were not authorized to [sic]\naccess and had no justification for doing so. The investigation revealed\nthat your activities, which lasted from October 2003 and [sic] January\n2004, violated base computer policy. As a result of the investigation you\nwere reassigned and barred from computer access on the Base during the\nremainder of your assignment there.\nOn June 17, 2009, the government moved to amend the SOR by removing the\nword \u201cclassified.\u201d There being no objection at hearing, I granted the government\u2019s\nmotion. (Tr. 11) Accordingly, the information at issue was either business-sensitive or\nother information to which Applicant allegedly was not authorized access.\nIn response to the SOR, as to the allegation that he was not authorized to access\nthe information systems, or parts thereof, at the military installation where he worked,\nApplicant denied that he did so without authorization. He claimed that his access was\nboth verbally authorized and inherently part of his assigned duties as a Functional\nSystems Administrator (FSA). As to the allegation that he downloaded and stored on his\n\n3\ngovernment computer unauthorized software, Applicant admitted doing so. However, he\nclaimed that, while the software was not authorized, he obtained the software in an\neffort to improve his ability to perform his FSA duties. In response to the allegation that\nhe improperly, and without authorization or need, downloaded to his computer hard-\ndrive contract information, Applicant again denied that he was not authorized access to\nthat information. He also asserted that the information at issue was inadvertently\ndownloaded, and that whatever was downloaded was not released outside of any\nDepartment of Defense computer system. In addition to the admissions of fact\ncontained in Applicant\u2019s answer, I make the following additional findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old network systems engineer. He and his wife have been\nmarried since April 1994, and they have two children (ages 14 and 11). In August 2005,\nhe began working for a temporary agency that placed him with a defense contractor,\nwhich hired him as a full-time employee in November 2005. He still works for that\ncontractor as a senior network administrator and site manager. Applicant enjoys a good\nreputation for reliability, honesty, and professionalism at his current company. (Answer\nto the SOR) He is studying for his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer management, and\nhas nine more classes to complete. Applicant was in the United States Navy from\nJanuary 1991 until January 1999. He served as an aviation electronics technician (AT)\nand was honorably discharged as a second class petty officer (paygrade E-5). (Gx. 1;\nTr. 56 - 57, 61 - 62, 106) \nIn March 2002, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor to work as an FSA at\nan overseas U.S. military installation. The company\u2019s contract with that installation\ncalled for base-wide support for information technology systems management and\nassurance, as well as a host of other facilities support services. The contract was known\nas the Base Maintenance Contract (BMC) and was valued at $22 million over five years.\n(Gx. 3)\nThe base where Applicant worked was divided organizationally into functional\ndepartments for Civil Engineering (CE), Communications, Contracts, and Quality\nAssurance (QA). CE was responsible for all facilities maintenance and construction\nmatters. Communications was responsible for all matters related to IT systems. \nEach department had its own computer servers dedicated to storing and\nprocessing their information on an IT system, which was used throughout the military\nbranch involved here. It stored and processed information across departments\nconcerning contracts, fuel, supplies, construction, facilities maintenance, and other\nmatters related to running the base. Access to each server was generally limited to\npersonnel within a given department. However, because of their duties, some personnel\nhad access to multiple or all servers across departmental boundaries. \nOn December 12, 2002, Applicant was appointed as his company\u2019s operations\nsupervisor for all IT matters within CE. (Attachment to SOR Answer) He testified that his\nduties also included assignment as a QA representative for the principle IT system he\nworked on. For access purposes, Applicant was assigned as a work group manager\n(WM), which, by system design, allowed him access to a variety of servers, including\nthe Contracts Server. (Tr. 58 - 62)\n\n4\nThe Contracts Department handled matters ranging from requisition of supplies\nto contract bids, contract performance monitoring, contract awards, and other business-\nrelated matters for the command. Contained in the Contracts Server was, in relevant\npart, information about contracts between the military facility and its defense\ncontractors, including the BMC itself. Other information ranged from the actual contract\nand bid specifications to Powerpoint slides presenting information about costs and other\nmeasures of contractor performance. (Gx. 3)\nOn January 15, 2004, military investigators were advised that there had been\nseveral instances of unauthorized access into the Contracts Server by an employee of\nApplicant\u2019s company. The investigation quickly yielded information sufficient for agents\nto seize Applicant\u2019s government computer. On January 16, 2004, Applicant\u2019s access to\ngovernment IT systems was cancelled and he was assigned other duties pending\ncompletion of the investigation. Specifically, it was found that over a three-month period\nending on January 8, 2004, Applicant accessed the Contracts Server up to 30 times. It\nwas also found that Applicant accessed the government computer assigned to a military\nofficer in the Contracts Department at least 20 times. During the three-month period in\nquestion, Applicant was on holiday leave for 19 days between December 2003 and\nJanuary 2004. (Gx. 3; Attachments to Answer)\nInspection of Applicant\u2019s government computer showed that a copy of the BMC\nwas located on the hard drive. Applicant explained that he did not intentionally\n\u201cdownload\u201d the BMC. While testing the vulnerabilities of the base-wide IT system, he\naccessed the Contracts server as a WM. The BMC file was created using one\napplication, but he opened the BMC file in an application different from the one the file\nwas created in. When exiting the file, he was prompted to decide whether to save the\nfile in the application he used rather than the original application. He asserted that he\nsaid \u201cyes,\u201d but that the result was that a copy was saved to his computer. (Tr. 97) He did\nnot explain why he answered \u201cyes\u201d rather than leave the BMC in its original state, or\nwhy he did not delete it from his computer, or why there were other related files on his\ncomputer. He also did not explain why he had to access the Contracts Server more than\n30 times, or the officer\u2019s computer more than 20 times, or the BMC itself to test system\nvulnerabilities.\nInspection of Applicant\u2019s computer also showed that he had stored several\nsoftware applications on his computer. Applicant acknowledged that he needed\npermission from the designated point of contact (a junior enlisted person at either the E-\n3 or E-4 paygrade) in the base Communications Department before downloading or\ninstalling any hardware on his computer. He claimed he did so as to some of the\nsoftware, but also admitted there were several unauthorized software applications\nstored on his computer. He knew at the time that only software on an approved list\ncould be loaded onto DoD computers. However, he also claimed that he did not actually\ninstall any of the software. He looked at it to see if he could use it in support of his FSA\nduties. He had intended to transfer the software to a compact disk, but he did not\nexplain why he would even keep the software. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 3; Tr. 53 - 56, 68 -\n76)\n\n5\nInvestigative interviews were conducted with personnel and technicians, both\nmilitary and civilian, from the Contracts and Communications Departments. Several of\nthose interviewed questioned whether anyone outside of the Contracts Department\nshould have access to the contracts server. (Gx. 3) However, the same investigative\nreport also showed that the Applicant had broad access throughout the system by virtue\nof his designation as a WM. The IT system was set up so that all WM\u2019s had access\nacross the system regardless of whether they worked in CE or QA or Contracts. \nThe investigative report also found that Applicant had complained to the\nCommunications Department about this configuration and suggested that it be changed\nto be more restrictive as to who had access to various data bases, including the\nContracts Server. Three times the permissions were changed, but each time the\npermissions were reinstated. Applicant explained that this occurred because of the way\nthe system was designed. Once that was changed, the restricted access remained\npermanent. (Gx. 3, Section 2-3; Tr. 88 - 92)  \nThe investigation into Applicant\u2019s actions did not result in any disciplinary action\nagainst the Applicant. The report of investigation did not contain any conclusions about\nwhat happened or about culpability. Further, there is no indication that the information\nApplicant accessed was ever compromised or used for improper purpose. The report\ndid not cite any specific regulation or procedure at the base or from other authority that\nApplicant may have violated. Finally, there was no finding that any of the software was\nactually installed in the DoD system in question, or that the software was designed or\nintended for malicious purpose.\nIn January 2004, Applicant lost his access to the information systems and was\nassigned other duties pending the outcome of the investigation. In July 2004, he took\nextended leave due to a death in the family. When that leave expired, he asked for and\nwas granted a two-year leave of absence, because he did not want to sit idle pending\ncompletion of the military\u2019s investigation into his conduct. He was never advised of any\ninvestigative conclusions. His employment with that contractor ended in August 2006\nwhen he let pass the deadline for advising the company that he was returning from his\nleave of absence. (Ax. A)\nDepartment Counsel asked that administrative notice be taken of four documents\nor publications. All four provide guidance and definitions regarding DoD information\nsystems management and protection. Department Counsel specifically cited section\n4.19 of DoD Directive 8500.1 (Jx. I), which requires that software available from public\nsources \u201cshall only be used in DoD information systems to meet compelling\nrequirements.\u201d DoD Instruction 8500.2 (Jx. II) provides extensive definitions within the\nDoD Information Assurance Program and provides guidance for implementing that\nprogram. However, neither party argued for application of any specific provision of that\ndocument to the facts in this case. Jx. III is the instruction that provides network user\nlicensing and network professional certification guidance for the military branch\nApplicant was supporting. It addressed the FSA by saying that FSA\u2019s \u201cmust thoroughly\nunderstand the customer\u2019s mission and stay completely knowledgeable of the hardware\nand software capabilities and limitations.\u201d (Jx. III, p. 12) Of WM\u2019s, this document stated,\n\u201cWMs possess developed knowledge of hardware, software, and communications\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n6\nprinciples, and install, configure, and operate client/server devices. They resolve day-to-\nday administrative and technical problems users experience and contact their . . . FSA\nor [help desk] if they cannot resolve their problem.\u201d (Jx. III, p. 13) Finally, Department\nCounsel cited in Jx. IV, an excerpt from the Federal Acquisition Regulations System\n(FARS), which generally prohibits unauthorized disclosure of \u201ccontractor bid or proposal\ninformation or source selection information before the award of a Federal agency\nprocurement contract to which the information relates.\u201d (48 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.104-4(a))\n \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 39 (Guideline M - Use of Information Technology Systems).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n7\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.8\nAnalysis\nUse of Information Technology Systems\nThe government allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, if proved, would raise a security\nconcern addressed in AG \u00b6 39 as follows: \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related  computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nI have considered the available disqualifying factors listed under AG \u00b6 40 as\nthese facts apply to them. At the outset, the facts and circumstances of this case do not\nrequire or support consideration of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 40(b)\n(illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation or denial of access to\ninformation, software, firmware, or hardware in an information technology system), AG \u00b6\n40(c) (use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access to another\nsystem or to a compartmented area within the same system), AG \u00b6 40(d) (downloading,\nstoring, or transmitting classified information on or to any unauthorized software,\nhardware, or information technology system), AG \u00b6 40(g) (negligence or lax security\nhabits in handling information technology that persist despite counseling by\nmanagement), and AG \u00b6 40(h) (any misuse of information technology, whether\ndeliberate or negligent, that results in damage to the national security).\nAs to AG \u00b6 40(a) (illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology\nsystem or component thereof), and AG \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or\nother information technology system), it does not appear that Applicant\u2019s access to the\n\n8\nContracts Server or the officer\u2019s computer was either illegal or unauthorized. Within the\nbroad terms of his job description as an FSA and his access as a WM, along with the\naccess designed into the IT system in question, it appears it was perfectly legitimate for\nApplicant to access both components. It may be that the IT system should not have\nbeen designed to allow him access as he was a contractor employee. But all of the\navailable information shows that he was authorized to access the files and information\nin question. The more salient question is whether it was acceptable for a contractor to\naccess the BMC or other such information. At the very least, his actions created the\nappearance of impropriety, in that, as a contractor, he possessed information that\npotentially could have given his company an unfair advantage when it came to bidding\non renewal of the contract in question. However, there is no information about whether\nthe contract was due for renewal, or whether the information was passed to anyone who\nmight use it for that purpose. \nUnanswered by the Applicant are reasonable questions regarding the number of\ntimes he accessed the Contracts Server and the officer\u2019s server in such a brief period.\nHe claimed he was required to test the IT system vulnerabilities, and to maintain and\nimprove the system\u2019s efficiency. He has not explained why he accessed the Contracts\nServer or the officer\u2019s computer so many times, or, for that matter, why it was necessary\nto access those particular aspects of the IT system in the first place. However, because\nApplicant denied the aspect of this allegation regarding access to the IT system, the\ngovernment was required to present sufficient reliable information to show that his\naccess was \u201cillegal or unauthorized,\u201d and not simply improper or unwise. AG \u00b6 40(a)\ndoes not apply.\nThe disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 40(f) (introduction, removal, or duplication of\nhardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any information technology system\nwithout authorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations)\nmust also be considered. It is uncontroverted that Applicant stored software on his\ngovernment computer he knew was not on a list of approved software. However, it was\nnot established that the software that was actually installed and was in use on his\ncomputer. Nonetheless, his actions constituted \u201cintroduction\u201d for purposes of AG \u00b6 40(f),\nand Applicant knew it was prohibited to put the software on his computer as he did. AG\n\u00b6 40(f) applies.\nBy contrast, the record as a whole also supports the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6\n41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It has been more than five\nyears since Applicant left his position pending the outcome of the investigation. There\nis, as yet, no conclusion by those involved with the investigation about whether\nApplicant did anything to justify revocation of his system access. Since leaving that job,\nhe has worked for his current employer with good results and without incident. His\nreferrals praise his reliability and expertise, and it does not appear that he has or will\nrepeat his past mistakes regarding software introduction. The other mitigating conditions\nunder AG \u00b6 41 do not apply.\n\n9\nAs to any specific rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations that may have\nbeen violated, the information presented through Jx. I - IV provided definitions helpful in\nunderstanding Applicant\u2019s FSA and WM duties. At the DoD level, Jx. I made clear that\nsoftware introduction should be done pursuant to a \u201ccompelling requirement.\u201d However,\nthere is nothing in the record, especially in the Report of Investigation (ROI) in Gx. 2,\nthat cites specific rules or procedures, either instituted by the base military organization\nor by Applicant\u2019s company, that he violated. Further, other than the opinions of those\ninterviewed during the investigation, the ROI contains no conclusions about procedural\nor rules violations, and no conclusions about culpability. On balance, I conclude the\nsecurity concerns raised by the available information are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline M. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 39 years old,\nmarried for more than 15 years, and the father of two. He is also a veteran of the U.S.\nNavy and has been steadily employed without incident since his honorable discharge in\n1999. He is also studying for a bachelor\u2019s degree related to his field of expertise. Aside\nfrom an inconclusive investigation into his access to an IT system for which he was, at\nleast partially responsible, there is no information that would support a conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are not sufficient for purposes of\naccess to classified information. A fair and commonsense evaluation of this record\nshows that the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s conduct relative to information\ntechnology systems are mitigated. Any doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information have been satisfied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. Request for security\nclearance is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On November 6, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant, which detailed security concerns under Guidelines C and B stating why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be denied or revoked. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\n\nAt several places in the SOR and the Transcript, \u201cColombia\u201d is misspelled \u201cColumbia.\u201d  \n1\n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 20, 2008. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 1, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 27,\n2009, and I received the case assignment on January 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on February 17, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March\n24, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, without objection. Pursuant to her request, the record\nremained open for the Applicant to submit additional information. The Applicant\nsubsequently submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J, which was also received without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing, and the record closed, on April 14, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nProcedural Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Republic of Colombia.  (Transcript at 10-12.) The request\n1\nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the\nrecord. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant was 36 at the time of the hearing and single.  She is employed by\na Defense contractor and seeks a Department of Defense security clearance in\nconnection with her employment in the defense industry.  In her Answer to the SOR, the\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations of the SOR with the exception of subparagraph\n1.d.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has acted in a way that shows a preference for another country\nahead of the United States. \n\nThe Applicant\u2019s American passport also shows travel to the Phillippines and to Costa Rica.\n2\nSee Administrative Notice Document II at 1.\n3\n3\nThe Applicant was born in Colombia in 1972.  At the age of five, the Applicant\u2019s\nparents divorced.  She lived with her grandmother after that time until 1993.  By 1993,\nthe Applicant\u2019s stepmother had moved to the United States and had become a citizen.\nShe sponsored the Applicant\u2019s move to this country at that time.\nThe Applicant became a naturalized American citizen on February 24, 2000.\n(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 8.)  She holds a current American passport issued in\nMay 2004.  The passport shows that it was properly used by the Applicant to travel\noutside the United States, including entry and exit from Colombia in July and August\n2006.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 14.)2\nThe Applicant had an active Colombian passport that she acquired on August 1,\n2006.  This passport is valid through 2016.  The only stamp in this passport is the one\nshowing her exit from Colombia in August 2006.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 20-37.)  The\nApplicant was required by Colombian authorities to obtain this passport, after she\nentered the country, in order to leave Colombia after her last visit.  This is in accordance\nwith Colombian law, which does not recognize revocation of Colombian citizenship.  The\nApplicant submitted documentation from the Department of State and the Colombian\ngovernment stating this fact. (Government Exhibit 3 at 4-5; Transcript at 26, 34-36.)3\nThe Applicant has several times stated her intent and desire to renounce her\nColombian citizenship.  She has said this, with full knowledge that the Colombian\ngovernment will not allow such an event to occur.  (Transcript at 28-29, 41-42.)\n  \nWhen she was informed of the Government\u2019s concerns about her having a\nColombian passport, the Applicant took steps to resolve this situation.  Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A is a Memorandum from the Installation Personnel Security Manager at the\nmilitary base where she works.  This person confirms in writing that he shredded the\nApplicant\u2019s Colombian passport on March 20, 2009.  (Transcript at 59-60.)  \nThe Applicant had the passport destroyed, knowing it would effect her ability to\ntravel to Colombia. Specifically, the Applicant understands that, if her father or brother,\nwho both still live in Colombia, pass away, she will not be able to travel there for their\nfunerals.  (Transcript at 41-42, 59-62.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Preference) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the\nexercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n4\nsupport of his request for administrative notice and its attachments. \n4\nThe Applicant\u2019s father and brother are citizens and residents of Colombia.  As\nstated earlier, the Applicant\u2019s parents divorced when she was quite young.  She has\nnever had a deep relationship with her father, and it has not improved with the years.\nShe last saw her father when she visited Colombia in 2006.  While they did\ncommunicate by telephone after her return, she has not spoken to her father in over a\nyear.  (Transcript at 45-48.)\nThe Applicant also does not have much contact with her brother.  It has also\nbeen more than a year since she spoke to him, and she has not seen him in many\nyears.  (Transcript at 48-49.)\nThe other members of the Applicant\u2019s immediate family live in the United States.\nThe includes the Applicant\u2019s stepmother, two half-brothers and two half-sisters.  One\nhalf-sister was living in Colombia, but she moved to the United States in January 2009.\nThe Applicant presented supporting documentary evidence.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J;\nTranscript at 49-50.)\nThe Applicant has lived in the United States since 1993.  In the 16 years since,\nshe has visited Colombia three times.  Two of those visits, 1998 and 1999, occurred\nbefore she was an American citizen.  She only visited Colombia in 2006 because a\nclose relative was seriously ill.  This relative has since passed away.  (Transcript at 40,\n51-52.)\nDue to the Applicant\u2019s connections with Colombia, it is appropriate to discuss the\ncurrent situation in Colombia.   Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy and\n4\nthe second most populous country in South America.  The country is a close ally of the\nUnited States with the current president, Alvaro Uribe, receiving the Presidential Medal\nof Freedom from President George W. Bush.  Colombia is a country that has a severe\nproblem with narco-terrorism, which has been lessened in recent years, but is still\npotent.  Kidnappings of Americans can, and has, occurred.  Although the government\u2019s\nrespect for human rights continued to improve, many problems remain.  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant is a successful, respected member of the defense industry.  Her\nconnections to the United States are many and varied.  In addition to owning a house,\nshe is engaged to a member of the United States military and she has worked for her\ncurrent employer for over six years.\nThe Applicant made the point that, in Colombia, there are many barriers to a\nwoman succeeding outside the home.  For example, the Applicant owns a house in the\nUnited States, but would not be able to do that in Colombia.  She is proud of her\n\n5\nsuccess in the United States, in the large part made possible by her being a citizen.\n(Transcript at 28-32; Administrative Notice Document I at 21-22.)\nThe Applicant is highly respected at her work.  Her supervisor describes the\nApplicant as \u201ca steadfast dedicated employee whose work has always been and\ncontinues to be exceptional.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 1.)  She is knowledgeable about\nher responsibilities if she were to be granted a security clearance.  (Transcript at 56-58.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s most recent performance evaluation from her company, dated\nDecember 15, 2008, is exceptional.  She rates a \u201c10\" (highest ranking) from her\nsupervisor, who states, \u201cHer [Applicant\u2019s] dedication and incredible attitude to the tasks\nshe is given can not be matched.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019 Exhibit B at 2.)\nAdditional exhibits submitted by the Applicant have current and retired members\nof the United States military speaking in very laudatory terms about her.  She is\ndescribed as a person whose \u201cintegrity and loyalty are genuine.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nThe Deputy Fire Chief at her base states that she \u201cconsistently displays good moral\njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  The Deputy\nCommander of a unit she works closely with states, \u201cShe [Applicant] has continually\nproven herself to be a person of exemplary character and outstanding ability.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \nShe received a Notable Achievement Award in 2003.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\nThe Applicant also submitted documentary evidence showing her involvement with the\nlocal community.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G and H.)   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ngranting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant was a dual citizen of Colombia and the United States, and\nhad a valid Colombian passport in the recent past (Guideline C); and that the Applicant\nhas family members in Colombia (Guideline B).  The Applicant, on the other hand, has\nsuccessfully mitigated the Government's case.\n\n7\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nTurning first to Guideline C, the Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s\nconcerns about her possible dual citizenship with Colombia, and her possession of a\nColombian passport after becoming an American citizen.  The concern is stated thus\nunder this Guideline, When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe Applicant obtained a valid Colombian passport after becoming an American\ncitizen.  Accordingly, Disqualifying Condition 10(a)(1) applies to the facts of this case:\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a)\nexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport. \nThe Applicant\u2019s Colombian passport was shredded by her installation Personnel\nSecurity Manager.  Accordingly, it has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated as required by Mitigating Condition 11(e).\nThe Applicant is a Colombian citizen by birth.  Colombia does not allow its\ncitizens to renounce their citizenship.  In such a case, it is the intent of the Applicant that\nmust be evaluated.  Here, the Applicant has expressed a credible intent to renounce her\nColombian citizenship.  Mitigating Condition 11(b) applies to this case: the individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  In addition, Mitigating Condition\n11(a) also applies as her dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth\nin a foreign country.  Guideline C is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\nThe Applicant has family connections to Colombia.  Her father and brother\ncontinue to live there, though her relationship with them is not close at all.  In fact, she\nhas not spoken to either of them in over a year and has no desire to return to Colombia.\n\n8\nIt became obvious during the hearing that the Applicant has deep and long-standing\nroots in the United States.  In particular, she drew attention to the fact that she is a\nsuccessful professional woman in the United States, and that this path would not be\navailable to her in Colombia.  She has made friends and connections in this country,\nhas purchased a house and is engaged to be married to a member of the United States\nmilitary.\nThe following Disqualifying Condition arguably applies to this case based solely\non the fact that the Applicant has family in Colombia: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family\nmember . . . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information. \nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given her particular background:\n7(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nBased on my analysis of the available information, the Applicant has overcome\nthe adverse inference of her family members present in Colombia.  Guideline B is found\nfor the Applicant.\n Whole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n9\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The evidence shows that the\nApplicant is a patriotic American citizen.  The Applicant eloquently testified about her\npride in being an American citizen, and a member of the defense industry.  She is\nknowledgeable about security and understands her responsibility.  I find that there is\nlittle or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8).  Using the whole person standard, the Applicant has mitigated the security\nsignificance of her foreign connections and alleged foreign preference and is eligible for\na security clearance. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes 13 different creditors the total sum of approximately $135,000 in delinquent debt based on credit card accounts. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts except for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, to which he admitted owing a lesser amount. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.

    "full_text": "  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition to the Executive\nOrder and Directive, this case is also adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining\nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December\n29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1,\n2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.\nThe Directive is pending revision or amendment.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order,\nDoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on August 20, 2008. The\nSOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the\nDecember 23, 2008\n\n2\naction. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based\non a history of financial problems.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on September 2, 2008,\nand he requested a hearing. It took place as scheduled pursuant to written notice on\nNovember 20, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received November 26, 2008. For the\nreasons discussed below, this case is decided for Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes 13 different creditors the\ntotal sum of approximately $135,000 in delinquent debt based on credit card accounts.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts except for the debt alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.m, to which he admitted owing a lesser amount. Based on the record evidence\nas a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old project manager for a federal contractor, and he is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance for this employment. He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since October 2007. His annual salary is about $84,000. He has been\nmarried since 1982, and he and his wife have an adult son. They have lived at the same\naddress since 1995. His wife has been unable to work during their marriage due to a\nseizure disorder.\nHis wife, in addition to her seizure disorder, has experienced other serious\nmedical problems (Tr. 40\u201342). She broke her hip in August 2001, and was hospitalized\nor in rehabilitation until January 2002. A hip replacement operation was followed by\nphysical therapy that resulted in her fracturing the upper part of her femur during a\ntherapy session. Another operation was required for another hip replacement and to\nrepair her femur. The multiple operations likely contributed to a staph infection. Treating\nthe infection required removing the hip apparatus. She went without a hip for about 15\nto 16 months; according to Applicant, \u201cher leg literally just hung there\u201d (Tr. 42). She had\nanother hip replacement operation in 2003, the result of which is one leg is shorter than\nthe other, and she now has difficulty moving without the assistance of a walker.\nAlthough Applicant has medical insurance as a military retiree, his wife\u2019s medical\nproblems resulted in out-of-pocket expenses for items not covered by insurance (Tr.\n43).     \nHis employment history includes military service in the U.S. Navy and the U.S.\nAir Force for a combined total of more than 20 years. He served six years as an enlisted\nSailor from 1973 to 1979. He then obtained a college degree in architecture. Thereafter,\nfrom 1984 to 1999, he served nearly 15 years as a commissioned Air Force officer\nworking in the field of civil engineering where he managed construction projects. He\nfurthered his education while in the Air Force by obtaining a master\u2019s degree in\nmanagement. He held a security clearance, to include up to the top-secret level, while in\nthe Air Force. He retired from the Air Force in 1999 at the grade of major. His DD Form\n214 describes the character of his service as honorable and it reveals that he served in\n\n3\nthe 1990\u20131991 Gulf War (Tr. 65\u201367; Exhibit A). He receives retired pay of about\n$24,000 annually (Tr. 50). \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute\n(Exhibits 1, 2, 3, and 4). When he completed his security-clearance application in\nOctober 2007, he reported, by name, amount, and account number, 19 credit card\naccounts that were past due or delinquent (Exhibit 1). Also, he made his  employer\naware of his financial situation when he was hired. He acknowledged his financial\nproblems and explained the surrounding circumstances during an official interview in\nJanuary 2008 and in response to interrogatories in June 2008 (Exhibits 2 and 3). To\ndate, Applicant has not paid, settled, or otherwise resolved any of the debts in the SOR.\nA chronology of events is helpful in understanding Applicant\u2019s financial problems.\nThe relevant events are as follows:\n1.\nAfter retiring from the Air Force, from 1999 to about July 2006, Applicant worked\nas an inspector and project manager for private construction or building\ncompanies. He was earning about $75,000 annually.\n2.\nIn about mid-2006, Applicant began working as a self-employed general\ncontractor with his own construction company. He did so with the encouragement\nof a former employer who indicated he would direct business to Applicant, but\nthat proved to be a false promise. Applicant had about $30,000 to $40,000 in\npersonal debt when he began the business, but none of the debt was delinquent.\nGiven these circumstances, he was comfortable taking the calculated risk of\nstarting his own business. \n3.\nIn late September 2006, Applicant slipped-and-fell off a ladder while at work. The\nfall shattered or fractured his elbow. The work-related injury required surgery and\nhe was unable to work at full capacity for the next two to three months.\n4.\nHe had a second surgery on his elbow in February 2007. Again, he was unable\nto work at full capacity for the next couple of months.\n5.\nApplicant\u2019s income declined during this period. His retired pay was not enough to\ncover personal and business expenses. He used credit cards to keep his\nconstruction company going and to pay for personal expenses. He fell behind on\nthe credit card accounts and on his home mortgage loan.\n6.\nIn early 2007, Applicant attempted to refinance his home, in which he had home\nequity. The idea was to use the proceeds to pay the credit card accounts. The\nrefinancing looked promising at first, but it did not go to conclusion.\n7.\nIn March 2007, Applicant obtained the services of a law firm specializing in debt\nsettlement (Exhibit 3). He entered into a legal services contract wherein he\nagreed to pay a 33% contingency fee upon settlement of a debt. The contingency\nfee was in addition to a one-time retainer fee. He also agreed to make monthly\ndeposits of $1,257 into the firm\u2019s trust account and the firm in turn agreed to\nnegotiate in an attempt to settle Applicant\u2019s debts with unsecured creditors.   \n8.\nApplicant made the monthly deposits and by March 2008, the firm was\nsuccessful in settling one debt (Exhibit 3). The firm settled a $9,473 debt for\n$2,368, which resulted in a settlement fee of $2,344 for the firm. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n2\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n3\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n4\n9.\nIn about May or June 2008, Applicant and his wife became dissatisfied with the\nprocess and its expense. They also felt misled about the nature of the services\nand terminated their relationship with the firm. \n10.\nAt this point, Applicant had been earning a regular salary since October 2007\nand decided to consult a bankruptcy attorney for advice. They determined a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy with a court-approved repayment plan was the best\noption. They obtained the required credit counseling in July 2008 (Exhibits B and\nC). \n11.\nIn August 2008, Applicant received the SOR and decided to delay the\nbankruptcy case pending the outcome of this case.\n12.\nAll these events took place during his wife\u2019s chronic unemployment. \nAssuming he retains his current job and salary, Applicant and his wife intend to\npursue a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case so they can repay their debts via a court-\napproved plan over a period of years. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.2\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n3\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n4\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n5\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n13\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n14\n5\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n12\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n13\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n14\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n15\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n16\n6\nindicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n15\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n16\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and the most pertinent here is MC 2,\nwhich concerns events or circumstances largely beyond a person\u2019s control. Another is\nMC 4, which concerns initiating a good-faith effort to repay. Each is discussed below. \nApplicant receives credit in mitigation under MC 2 because his financial problems\nresulted from events or circumstances largely beyond his control. The primary event or\ncircumstance was his work-related injury and resulting fall in income, which took place\nunder the umbrella of his wife\u2019s chronic unemployment due to her inability to work.\nTaken together, these events or circumstances had a snowball or cumulative effect, the\nconsequences of which Applicant is still experiencing. It is more likely than not that\n\n See generally Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934).\n17\n Applicant estimates he paid the firm about $18,000 in total (Tr. 20, 51). \n18\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n19\n7\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems would not have occurred but for these events or\ncircumstances.  \nIn addition, Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He seized\nthe opportunity to return to full-time employment in October 2007. The job allowed him\nto earn a regular salary and put him in a position to do something about his debts. He\ndisclosed his financial problems to the government and his employer. Although a court-\napproved repayment plan under Chapter 13 is less than ideal and should be considered\na last resort, it is a lawful and realistic solution to his financial problems. Given the\nparticular facts of this case, Applicant is the definition of an \u201chonest but unfortunate\ndebtor\u201d  who has acted responsibly under difficult circumstances.  \n17\nApplicant also receives credit under MC 4 due to his efforts to repay creditors. He\nfirst attempted to repay the debts by refinancing his mortgage loan, but was\nunsuccessful. He then employed the services of the law firm to settle the debts.\nAlthough the process produced only one settlement, Applicant paid several thousand\ndollars to the firm,  and those payments were made in a good-faith effort to settle his\n18\ndebts. Unfortunately, the fees likely undercut those efforts and Applicant ultimately\ndecided that this was not the best solution. Nevertheless, Applicant deserves credit\n(although not full credit) in mitigation for his efforts.  \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate a\nperson\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the person\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  \n19\nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, this case presents both disqualifying\nand mitigating circumstances, which requires thoughtful balancing. First, Applicant is 53\nyears old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances. Second,\nApplicant is in a difficult spot. But having had the opportunity to listen to his testimony\n(which I found credible) and observe his demeanor, I am persuaded that Applicant has\nthe intention, maturity, and self-discipline to follow through and resolve his delinquent\ndebts. Repaying his creditors will take substantial time, but given his wife\u2019s chronic\n\n8\nunemployment and her medical problems, I am also persuaded that he is highly\nmotivated to keep his current job and comply with all security requirements so that he\ncan support and care for his wife. Third, Applicant has two decades of successful and\nhonorable military service to his credit. This circumstance strongly suggests that he has\nthe requisite self-control, good judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nproperly handle and safeguard classified information. In other words, the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in a security-clearance context is remote. \nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant did present sufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. He did not present a\nperfect case in mitigation, but it is sufficient to overcome the security concerns.\nApplicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.m:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 As to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d in his response to the SOR. He admitted his brother, nephew and sister are citizens and residents of Afghanistan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c). His nephew is a body guard or security officer for government officials in Afghanistan (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He traveled to his brother\u2019s funeral in Afghanistan (SOR \u00b6 1.d). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 56-year-old linguist employed by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan (Tr. 141, 202-203). He is fluent in Pashtun (Tr. 163). He was born in Afghanistan (Tr. 141). He was raised in Afghanistan and completed high school in Afghanistan (Tr. 148). He served one year in the Kingdom of Afghanistan Army from 1973 to 1974 (Tr. 231, GE 3). His military duty was as a military policeman (Tr. 231, GE 3). After high school he worked in the tourist industry and for the Afghan airlines as a clerk and accountant (Tr. 148, 204). Applicant and his wife left Afghanistan in 1979 because it was too dangerous to remain there (Tr. 142-143). They first went to Pakistan and stayed in a refugee camp (Tr. 143). From Pakistan they came to the United States as refugees 26 years ago when he was 29 years old (Tr. 144, 203, GE 3).2 After arriving in the United States, he went to school to learn English and about computers (Tr. 145).

Cohen, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding foreign influence. Because of his \ndeep and long-standing relationships with his family in the United States and his other \nconnections to this country, as well as his support of the U.S. Army while serving under \nhazardous conditions in Afghanistan as a translator, I am confident he will resolve any \nconflicts in favor of U.S. interests. Access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 1, 2006, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaire for \nSensitive Positions (Standard Form (SF) 86)(GE 1). On May 30, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. On August 30, \n2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) directed application of revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations made under \nNovember 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 17, 2008, Applicant provided a response to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have his case decided at a hearing (GE 6). On September 10, 2008, the case \nwas assigned to me. On September 29, 2008, notice was issued for the hearing, which \nwas held on October 30, 2008 (GE 4). At the hearing, Department Counsel offered \nthree exhibits (Transcript (Tr.) 19, GEs 1-3), and Applicant offered 29 exhibits (Tr. 13, \n28-29, 38-39, 166-167, 196, AE A-AC). There were no objections (except for AE M to \nW, AA and AB), and I admitted GEs 1-3 (Tr. 19) as well as AEs A-L, Y and AA (Tr. 28-\n29, 38-39, 166-167, 196). Additionally, I admitted the Hearing Notice, SOR and \nresponse to the SOR (GEs 4-6). DOHA received the transcript on November 7, 2008. \nThe documents not admitted are attached to the record.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant asked me to take administrative notice \nconcerning materials related to the Afghanistan (GE 7, AE AC). Applicant objected to \nmy consideration of facts beyond the Department Counsel\u2019s 6-page document entitled \nAdministrative Notice, dated August 11, 2008 (Tr. 20-24, GE 7). Specifically, Applicant \nobjected to admission or administrative notice for Exhibits I through VII because those \ndocuments contain facts that are not relevant to a security clearance determination. I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request; however, I offered the parties two days to request \nadministrative notice of any additional facts (Tr. 20-25). Applicant requested \nAdministrative notice of facts in AE AC, as supported by AE M through W (Tr. 27). \nDepartment Counsel did not object to my administrative notice of the facts in AE AC, \nand requested that AE M through W receive the same consideration as Exhibits I \nthrough VII (Tr. 27). I granted Department Counsel\u2019s request and took administrative \nnotice of the facts in GE 7 and AE AC as indicated in the Afghanistan portion of the \nStatement of Facts section of this decision, and did not take administrative notice of \nsupporting documents Exhibits I through VII and AE M through W (Tr. 27).  \n \nIn support of the requested administrative notice of facts concerning Afghanistan, \nsupporting documents show detail and context for those facts (Ex. I to VII\u2014listed in \nRequest for Administrative Notice at 6). Administrative or official notice is the \nappropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. \n12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most \ncommon basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \neither well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section \n25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). \nExhibits I to VII are attached to GE 7 to ensure the administrative record is complete.  \n \nI advised the parties that I would provide a document to the parties after the \nhearing listing the facts I would include in my decision about Afghanistan, including \npossibly some facts from documents not already part of the record (Tr. 89-94, 254-255). \nThe parties would have an opportunity to object or comment on the facts (Tr. 89-94, \n254-255). On October 30, 2008, I emailed to the parties my proposed factual summary \nconcerning Afghanistan with supporting documents (AJ Ex. I to VII). Applicant objected \nto some of the facts included for administrative notice as well as some of the references \nlisted, and asserted some facts were taken out of context or incomplete (AJ Ex. IX). \nDepartment Counsel had no objections to my proposed administrative notice (AJ Ex. I).  \nOn November 5, 2008, I made some changes to the facts included for administrative \nnotice, which I disclosed to the parties, and I offered an additional opportunity to object \nor to submit additional facts to ensure the record is complete (AJ Ex. I). The parties did \nnot subsequently submit additional facts or objections, and I closed the record on \nNovember 12, 2008.  \n  \nExhibits AA and AB \n \n \nApplicant offered Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) Number 704, \n\u201cPersonnel Security Standards and Procedures Governing Eligibility for Access to \nSensitive Compartmented Information and Other Controlled Access Program \nInformation,\u201d effective October 1, 2008 (Ex. AA) (Tr. 29-32). Exhibit AA is an expression \nof the U.S. government\u2019s recognition \u201crisk management\u201d or the need for greater \nflexibility in approval of SCI clearance for Applicants with essential skills, who have \nfamily members living in dangerous countries (Tr. 29-32). Exhibit AA is applicable to \ndetermining eligibility for SCI access (para. C, Tr. 33). It authorizes a Head of an \nIntelligence Community Element authority to grant a waiver to express limitations \n\u201cbased on all available that the specific risk to national security is manageable and \nacceptable.\u201d (para. F.1). The overall goal of ensuring \u201cthe risk to national security in \nmanageable and acceptable\u201d (para. D.2) introduces a more flexible standard to SCI \ndeterminations, which allows translators and other essential personnel with family in \ndangerous foreign countries a greater possibility of receiving a clearance.  Compare \npara. E with Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/4 (superseded by ICD Number \n704). I denied Applicant\u2019s request for admission of Exhibit AA because Applicant\u2019s case \ndoes not involve SCI or other controlled access.  However, I accepted the parties\u2019 \narguments that Applicant\u2019s performance under dangerous conditions in Afghanistan was \na relevant, admissible consideration under the whole person concept (Tr. 34-39).    \n \n \nExhibit AB is primarily a summary of the law as the Appeal Board has articulated \nit, concerning situations where an Applicant has provided valuable service to the United \nStates in a combat zone, such as Afghanistan. Exhibit AB quotes portions of ISCR Case \nNo. 07-09816 (AJ June 12, 2008), ISCR Case No. 07-00034 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008), \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), and ISCR Case No. 04-12363 \n(App. Bd. July 14, 2006), as well as some cases involving the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nSeveral Appeal Board and Administrative Judge decisions are attached to Exhibit AB. \nDepartment Counsel objected to admissibility because the brief was more akin to a \nclosing argument than evidence. I declined to admit Exhibit AB as substantive evidence \nand instead considered it as a summary of the law. \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.d in his response to the SOR. He admitted his brother, nephew and sister are \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c). His nephew is a body guard \nor security officer for government officials in Afghanistan (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He traveled to his \nbrother\u2019s funeral in Afghanistan (SOR \u00b6 1.d). His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old linguist employed by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan (Tr. \n141, 202-203). He is fluent in Pashtun (Tr. 163). He was born in Afghanistan (Tr. 141). \nHe was raised in Afghanistan and completed high school in Afghanistan (Tr. 148). He \nserved one year in the Kingdom of Afghanistan Army from 1973 to 1974 (Tr. 231, GE \n3). His military duty was as a military policeman (Tr. 231, GE 3). After high school he \nworked in the tourist industry and for the Afghan airlines as a clerk and accountant (Tr. \n148, 204). Applicant and his wife left Afghanistan in 1979 because it was too dangerous \nto remain there (Tr. 142-143). They first went to Pakistan and stayed in a refugee camp \n(Tr. 143). From Pakistan they came to the United States as refugees 26 years ago \nwhen he was 29 years old (Tr. 144, 203, GE 3).2 After arriving in the United States, he \nwent to school to learn English and about computers (Tr. 145). His employment for the \nfirst 20 years in the United States was as a book keeper (Tr. 145). He worked for the \nsame employer for 18 years (Tr. 146). He became a U.S. citizen on November 7, 1995 \n(Tr. 146). He did not return to Afghanistan after arriving in the United States until he \nwent to Afghanistan in July 2005 on behalf of the United States (Tr. 203-204). The only \npassport he has ever received is his U.S. passport (Tr. 224). He did not believe he was \na dual Afghan-U.S. citizen (Tr. 227). He thought his sole citizenship was United States \ncitizenship (Tr. 227).   \n \nApplicant agreed to deploy for a government contractor in 2004 (Tr. 168). He \nwent to Fort Benning, Georgia for two or three weeks for training (Tr. 168, 215). He \ndeployed to Afghanistan in January 2005 (Tr. 124, 169). Every six months he received \nthree weeks vacation in the United States, otherwise he was deployed to Afghanistan \nfrom January 2005 until July 2008 (Tr. 124, 169, 177-178, Ex. X, Y). Whenever he left a \nU.S. base in Afghanistan on a mission he wore body armor and a helmet because of the \ndanger (Tr. 170-171). He did not carry a weapon (Tr. 171). He said he was under fire \n \n1 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe names, employment or locations in order \nto protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.  \n \n2 Applicant misstated that he has lived in the United States 29 years. His CI Screening \nQuestionnaire \u2013 Middle East shows his date of entry into the United States as February 2, 1982 (GE 3). I \nbelieve he meant to say he left Afghanistan 29 years ago, spent about two years in Pakistan and came to \nthe United States 26 years ago. \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n(Tr. 171). He was exposed to danger from explosive devices while driving on the roads, \nand on one occasion there were injuries (Tr. 236). He successfully convinced the \nvillagers that forces from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United \nStates were there to build roads, hospitals and schools (Tr. 172-175, 216-217). They \nare attempting to establish peace and improve Afghanistan\u2019s infrastructure (Tr. 172-\n175). They are not in Afghanistan to occupy the country (Tr. 174). The Afghan people \nwant to raise their standard of living, and NATO supports this goal (Tr. 217). The Afghan \npeople were very hospitable once he explained the mission of the United States in \nAfghanistan (Tr. 173-174). He was very proud of helping the United States in \nAfghanistan (Tr. 176). The loss of his clearance resulted in his return to the United \nStates in July 2008. He wants to return to his duties in Afghanistan as soon as he \nreceives his clearance (Tr. 176, 215). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife make a statement at his hearing. She was born in Afghanistan. \nShe and her husband left Afghanistan and moved to Pakistan (Tr. 97). She is a U.S. \npermanent resident alien (Tr. 99). She tried to pass the citizenship test twice, but was \nunable to do so because her English was poor (Tr. 99). They have been married for 33 \nyears (Tr. 96). They have three children, a son (age 24), a daughter (age 21), and a son \n(age 17). All of their children were born in the United States and live in the United States \n(Tr. 97-98). They have not expressed any interest in becoming Afghan citizens (Tr. \n227). Applicant was away in Afghanistan, except for brief annual visits for almost four \nyears (Tr. 102, 113).  Her daughter took care of the family because his wife had mental \nproblems (Tr. 103). She has migraine headaches, is depressed and hears screaming \n(Tr. 111). She takes strong medicine, and feels better now (Tr. 111, 112). She \ndescribed her husband as honest and trustworthy as well as a good husband and father \n(Tr. 104, 107). Applicant was proud of helping Americans in Afghanistan, but he did not \ndiscuss any details of his duties with her (Tr. 105, 108). She has two brothers who live \nin the United States (Tr. 106). She said Applicant was worried about his family that was \nstill in Afghanistan because it was dangerous (Tr. 109). Her 95-year-old father still lives \nin Afghanistan (Tr. 109, 110).  Her father has bad hearing and she does not call him on \nthe telephone (Tr. 110). She and her brothers living in the United States send him \nmoney (Tr. 111). Sometimes Applicant talks to his father-in-law when his wife talks to \nhim on the phone (Tr. 225).3 Applicant did not call or visit his father-in-law when he was \nin Afghanistan (Tr. 225).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter made a statement at his hearing (Tr. 119-137). She was \nborn and raised in the United States. She has never been to Afghanistan (Tr. 133). She \ncurrently attends college in the United States and plans to become a pediatrician (Tr. \n119). She has a part time job at a retirement community (Tr. 119). She said Applicant \nserved in Afghanistan because he wanted to do his patriotic duty and sacrifice for the \nUnited States (Tr. 125, 133-134). She was very proud of what he was doing in the war \nagainst terrorism (Tr. 129). While Applicant was in Afghanistan, she paid the bills and \ntook charge of the family (Tr. 125). She drove her mother to appointments and did the \ngrocery shopping (Tr. 127). Applicant gave her power of attorney because Applicant\u2019s \nspouse had mental problems (Tr. 126). Applicant did not discuss his duties in \n \n3 Although the SOR did not list Applicant\u2019s relationship with his father-in-law as a potential \nsecurity concern, Applicant\u2019s 2004 Linguist Screening disclosed this relationship.    \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nAfghanistan (Tr. 128). He is not close to his brother or nephew in Afghanistan (Tr. 132). \nShe described him as very honest, loyal, kind, gentle, affectionate and loving (Tr. 129-\n132). She speaks English and Farsi (Tr. 136). She did not remember talking to her \nfather\u2019s relatives, who live in Afghanistan (Tr. 137). Although she rarely speaks to her \nmother\u2019s father, she spoke to him a couple nights before the hearing (Tr. 137).  \n   \n \nApplicant has about 60 relatives who live in the United States, one sister who \nlives in the Netherlands (Tr. 150-152, 154, Ex. A), and one sister who lives in the United \nKingdom (Tr. 230, Ex. A). He does not own any property or expect to inherit any \nproperty in Afghanistan (Tr. 231). He has a U.S. bank account consisting of several \nhundred thousand dollars and does not have any bank accounts in foreign countries (Tr. \n233-234). He plans to purchase a house in the United States and to use some of the \nfunds to pay for his children\u2019s educations (Tr. 234-235). \n \nApplicant\u2019s 64-year-old brother, who lives in Afghanistan, is retired (Tr. 152). He \nis married and his spouse is a housewife (Tr. 152-153). They receive financial support \nfrom their children living in the United States and Canada (Tr. 157-158, 207-208). He \nhas never worked for the Afghan military or government (Tr. 152-153). Applicant did not \nknow whether his brother receives a pension from Afghanistan (Tr. 207). He had some \ncontact with his brother for one year when he was assigned to the same city where his \nbrother lives (Tr. 208). After he was moved to a different Afghanistan base, he was not \nable to visit his brother (Tr. 208-209). He has irregular contact by telephone with his \nbrother about three to six times a year to ask about his health or family (Tr. 156). His \nAfghan identification card is attached to the record as Ex. K (Tr. 162-163). He did not \ndiscuss his duties in Afghanistan with his brother (Tr. 164-165). Applicant told his \nbrother he was in Afghanistan on business (Tr. 165, 213-214). He sent his brother $500 \nlast year to defray some of the costs for his other brother\u2019s funeral (Tr. 208). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s nephew is a security guard or body guard for high-ranking Afghan \nofficials (Tr. 153-154, 166). He does not have any contact with his nephew and did not \nvisit him in Afghanistan (Tr. 157, 166, 210). Applicant obtained proof of his nephew\u2019s \nemployment from his sister (Ex. L, Tr. 165-166). \n \nApplicant\u2019s 75-year-old sister, who lives in Afghanistan, is a retired widow (Tr. \n154, 161). His sister\u2019s daughter lives in the United States and provides financial support \n(Tr. 158, 210-211). His sister has never worked for the Afghan military or government \n(Tr. 154). He met his sister one time while he was in Afghanistan (Tr. 211). He has \nirregular contact by telephone with his sister about four to six times a year to ask about \nher health (Tr. 156). Her Afghan identification card is attached to the record as Ex. J \n(Ex. 159-161). Applicant did not discuss his duties in Afghanistan with his sister (Tr. \n161-162). Applicant explained he was in Afghanistan on business (Tr. 162, 212-213). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s brothers (age 75) passed away in July 2007 while Applicant \nwas working for the contractor in Afghanistan (Tr. 190-197, Ex. H, I). Applicant asked for \npermission to attend the funeral in Afghanistan (Tr. 190-197). The contractor granted \npermission and arranged for a flight from Applicant\u2019s location to the location of the \nfuneral (Tr. 190, 192). \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n \nNo one has ever contacted Applicant or his Applicant\u2019s relatives in Afghanistan to \nput pressure on Applicant to provide classified information (Tr. 198, 199). If anyone \nattempted to do so, Applicant would report the attempt to U.S. law enforcement \nauthorities (Tr. 198-199). Even if their lives were threatened, he would report the \nattempt to U.S. authorities (Tr. 199).   \n \n \nApplicant helped the United States, France and Britain with translation and \nadvice when he lived in Pakistan for two years while the war with the Soviets was \noccurring in Afghanistan (Tr. 200-202, 205). He volunteered to help the United States in \nAfghanistan because he considered the Taliban to be criminals out to destroy the \nAfghanistan (Tr. 200). Applicant knew the Afghan culture and the environment and \nbelieved he could help the United States fight the criminals (Tr. 200). He was happy that \nthe United States had helped the Afghan people who had suffered so much for so many \nyears and was proud to be part of that effort (Tr. 211-212).   \n \nRecommendations and Work Performance \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evaluation ending April 1, 2006, described him as an outstanding \nlinguist, who quickly builds rapport with the person he is interviewing (Tr. 179, Ex. Y). \nHis goal is to become a career interrogator (Tr. 187-188, Ex. Y). Applicant received two \ncertificates of appreciation from his employer for his interrogation contributions to the \nU.S. Army in Afghanistan (Tr. 180, 217, Ex. D, E). One certificate noted his \u201cexceptional \ninterpreter support facilitating the collection of invaluable intelligence in support of the \n[unit omitted] and the global war on terror\u201d (Ex. D). It also highlighted his deduction to \nduty and personal sacrifices (Ex. D).   \n \n \nA real estate agent and part time taxi driver, who is Applicant\u2019s \u201cvery close friend\u201d \nand neighbor, has known Applicant for five and a half years (Tr. 41-46, 50).  Their \nfamilies frequently socialize together (Tr. 44-45).  Applicant is very trustworthy, very \nnice, \u201cvery polite and gentle guy\u201d (Tr. 46, 49). He is generous, friendly, honest and \nhelpful (Tr. 47, 49).  Applicant does not discuss what he did while in Afghanistan for the \nlast few years (while holding a security clearance) (Tr. 51-52). \n \n \nA driver for handicapped people and Applicant\u2019s friend lived in Applicant\u2019s \nneighborhood in Afghanistan in the 1980s (Tr. 57-59). He met Applicant about seven \nyears ago, when he saw Applicant in a shopping center in the United States (Tr. 60, 69). \nHe decided to move into Applicant\u2019s apartment complex about three years ago (Tr. 60, \n69). They live on the same floor of the same building (Tr. 67). Their families frequently \nsocialize together (Tr. 61-62). Applicant is his best friend and is like an older brother to \nhim (Tr. 62). He described Applicant as a \u201cnice guy, very respectable, very kind . . . \npatient with the kids\u201d and as \u201cthe best person\u201d (Tr. 64, 67).  Applicant is honest and law \nabiding (Tr. 65). Applicant does not discuss his duties while he was in Afghanistan (Tr. \n64). \n \n \nThe head teller at a bank, with a second job in a pharmacy was born in \nAfghanistan 41 years ago and came to the United States in 1996 (Tr. 76-77). Her father \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nwas killed in Afghanistan and she received asylum as a refugee (Tr. 78-79). She is \ncurrently a U.S. citizen (Tr. 78). She lived in Applicant\u2019s building in the United States for \ntwo years (Tr. 80-81).  She is a friend of Applicant\u2019s family (Tr. 80-82). She describes \nApplicant as honest a good father and husband (Tr. 82).  He is friendly, helpful, honest \nand generous (Tr. 82-84).  She knew Applicant went to Afghanistan; however, he did \nnot discuss what he did there (Tr. 85). She knew Applicant had a brother in Afghanistan; \nhowever, Applicant did not talk about his brother except to say he is doing fine (Tr. 88).  \n \n \nAnother friend who has known Applicant in Afghanistan before he came to the \nUnited States and in the United States described Applicant as honest, dedicated, ethical \nand loyal (Tr. 189, Ex. Z). Applicant is responsible and trustworthy (Ex. Z).  \n \nApplicant provided four training certificates (Ex. X) and a performance evaluation \nfrom his employer (Ex. Y). His rating indicates he either meets or exceeds expectations \n(Ex. Y). It was the only rating Applicant had received (Tr. 218). \n \n \n      \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan has been an independent nation since 1919. It was a monarchy until \na military coup in 1973. Following a second military coup in 1978, a Marxist government \nemerged. In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Afghanistan, but \nfreedom fighters known as mujahidin resisted the Soviet invasion. In February 1989, the \nSoviet Union withdrew pursuant to an agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, the \nUnited States, and the Soviet Union. The mujahidin were not a party to the agreement \nand refused to abide by it. The result was a civil war among several factions, including \nthe Taliban. By the end of 1998, the Taliban controlled most of Afghanistan. \n \nThe Taliban committed atrocities against minority populations, and provided \nsanctuary to Osama Ben-Laden, Al Qa\u2019ida, and other terrorist organizations. U.S. \nmilitary forces, along with forces from a coalition partnership, forced the Taliban out of \npower by November 2001. With the assistance and support of the United States, a new \ndemocratic government took office in 2004. \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s human rights record is generally poor, due to the continuing \ninsurgency, the weak government, and ongoing recovery efforts from two decades of \nwar. Abuses include extrajudicial killing, torture, and restrictions on individual rights and \nliberties. Killings by security forces, militias, terrorists and insurgents are a continuing \nproblem. The weak government and internal instability have enabled hostile states, non-\nstate actors, terrorists, and insurgents to continue operating in Afghanistan. \n\u201cAfghanistan is a nexus of insurgency. A large part of the insurgent problem in the \ncountry is the Taliban, but there are other militant groups, and they often are facilitated \nby al Qa\u2019ida. Mixed in with this is \u2018the effects of a narco-system that\u2019s been in this \ncountry for a long time  .  .  . It\u2019s also mixed in with smuggling and criminality, and then \nthere is a level of corruption that permeates this society. That\u2019s a formula for insecurity \nacross Afghanistan.\u201d4 \n \n4Interview of Gen. David McKiernan, Commanding General, Afghanistan International Security \nAssistance Force, on Sept. 16, 2008, by Jim Garamone, American Forces Press Service, available at   \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                            \nAlthough there is no evidence that the Afghan government conducts intelligence \noperations against the United States, several terrorist groups conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence agencies.  \n \n\u201cViolence is up in the country 30 percent over last year. Part of this is because \nthe insurgents do not challenge NATO, U.S. or Afghan forces directly. Car bombs, \nroadside bombs, indirect fire and small-scale ambushes are their tactics now.\u201d5 To date \n554 U.S. military personnel have been killed in Operation Enduring Freedom in and \naround Afghanistan.6 The increased death toll in Afghanistan of U.S. military personnel \nis indicative of the enhanced dangers faced by those serving in Afghanistan. In calendar \nyear 2007, 83 military personnel were killed in action in Afghanistan, and so far in \ncalendar year 2008, 115 military personnel have been killed in action in Afghanistan.7 \nAttacks are not limited to U.S. military personnel. Terrorists target police, police recruits, \ngovernment officials, civilians, and even school children and aid workers.  \n \nThe U.S. has supported the emergence of a broad-based democratic \ngovernment and is assisting the Afghan people with rebuilding their country and \nestablishing a representative government that contributes to regional stability and \nrespects human rights. In May 2005, the presidents of the two countries concluded a \nstrategic partnership agreement committing both countries to a long-term relationship. \nOn September 26, 2008, President Bush described Afghanistan as an ally in the war \nagainst terrorism and emphasized the progress and promise of future success in \nAfghanistan. President Bush lauded the efforts of Afghanistan, the United States and \nother countries in economic, education, and infrastructure development with a goal of a \nthriving democracy that will deny a safe haven to terrorists and extremists. The \nspectacular growth of the participation of women in Afghanistan society, education and \nthe political process bodes well for Afghanistan\u2019s future. Since 2001, the United States \nhas provided $31.9 billion for Afghanistan\u2019s security and development. In September \n2008, the United States announced a substantial increase in U.S. forces to be deployed \nto Afghanistan in the next several months.8 Secretary Gates noted on September 29, \n2008: \n \nIn Afghanistan, as the president announced earlier this month, U.S. troop \nlevels are rising, with the likelihood of more increases next year. Given its \nterrain, poverty, neighborhood, and tragic history, Afghanistan in many \nways poses an even more complex and difficult long-term challenge than \n \nhttp://www.defenselink.mil/utility/printitem.aspx?print=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?i\nd=51202 (AJ Ex.

Terrorists \nhave targeted international non-governmental organizations, United Nations workers, \nand recipients of non-governmental assistance. Suicide bombing attacks continue to \ninflict large numbers of casualties. Recognizing these challenges, Secretary Gates \nrecently emphasized, \u201cTo be blunt, to fail \u2013 or to be seen to fail \u2013 in either Iraq or \nAfghanistan would be a disastrous blow to our credibility, both among our friends and \nallies and among potential adversaries.\u201d10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \n \n \n9 Secretary of Defense Robert Gates\u2019 Speech to the National Defense University on Sept. 29, \n2008, at 1. Available at  http://www.defenselink.mil/utility/printitem.aspx?print=http://www.defenselink.mil/ \nspeeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1279 (AJ Ex.

See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n*  *  * \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; [and] \n \n*  *  * \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, brother, nephew and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. Applicant visited his brother and sister while he was serving in Afghanistan \non behalf of the U.S. Army. He occasionally has telephone conversations with some of \nthese family members living in Afghanistan. His nephew\u2019s employment is linked with the \nAfghan government because of his employment as a bodyguard. Applicant\u2019s spouse is \na citizen of Afghanistan and a U.S. resident alien. There is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of \nthe person's spouse, such as his father-in-law. See ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 20, 2002). Applicant lived in Afghanistan in support of the U.S. armed forces from \nJuly 2005 to July 2008.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Afghanistan was to perform his duties as a linguist and his \nattendance at his brother\u2019s funeral was a secondary ancillary benefit, as he was already \nin Afghanistan serving on military orders. Serving in support of the U.S. Army does not \nraise any independent security significance. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. \nSep 21, 2005). Applicant\u2019s financial support to his brother to defray part of the funeral \ncosts demonstrates his ties of affection and obligation to his family, and it has no \nindependent security significance.    \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or there is a serious \nproblem in the country with crime or terrorism. The U.S. participation in the war in \nAfghanistan places a significant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationship with family members living in Afghanistan \ndoes not pose a security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between \nloyalty to the United States and his family living in Afghanistan. With the ongoing war \nwith terrorists in Afghanistan, it is conceivable that terrorists would target any Afghan \ncitizen or former Afghan citizen living in Afghanistan or the United States in an attempt \nto gather valuable information from the United States. \n \nThere is evidence that terrorists seek classified information from the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s connections to his family members living in Afghanistan create a \npotential conflict of interest because these relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \npossible security concern about his desire to help these relatives living in Afghanistan \nby providing classified information.    \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships and \ncontacts with his spouse and family members living in Afghanistan to raise the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. There is clear evidence that \nAfghanistan remains a very dangerous place, and Applicant is exposed to death and \nserious injury from terrorists, criminals, Al Qa\u2019ida, or the Taliban when serving with the \nArmy in Afghanistan.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(d) and 7(i) apply requiring further review and \nanalysis.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                             \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to his family members living \nin Afghanistan. Applicant has an emotional bond with his family members living in \nAfghanistan, and through his wife with his father-in-law, who lives in Afghanistan. \nApplicant communicates with them regularly and frequently (as the Appeal Board \ndefines those terms). Although Applicant\u2019s close relationships with his family members \nliving in Afghanistan are an important positive reflection of his character, the same close \nrelationships raise security concerns for possible foreign influence.  See n. 11, infra.     \n \nThere is no evidence that his family members living in Afghanistan have been \npolitical activists or that they have high profile jobs with the Afghan government, the \nmilitary or any news media. There is no evidence that terrorists, criminals or the Afghan \nGovernment have approached or threatened Applicant\u2019s family members living in \nAfghanistan for any reason. There is no evidence that these family members living in \nAfghanistan currently engage in activities which would bring attention to them or that \nthey or other terrorists or other anti-U.S. elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with those family members. As such, there is a reduced possibility that \nthese relatives would be targets for coercion or exploitation. But see n. 11, infra \n(discussing limited weight that can be given to the absence of such information). \n \nApplicant deserves some credit due to the reduced possibility that terrorists will \nexploit Applicant through his relatives in Afghanistan because of the low profile they \nhave in Afghan society. Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his relatives in Afghanistan, \nhis frequent contacts with them, the nature of the terrorist threat in Afghanistan, and the \nrole of the United States in fighting the terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, all weigh \nagainst mitigating security concerns. See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 11, 2007) (finding contacts with siblings in PRC \u201conce every two or three  months\u201d \nnot to be casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per \nyear not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not \ncasual and infrequent).11     \n \nAlthough the United States and Afghanistan are allies in the war on terrorism and \nthe U.S. is committed to the establishment of a free and independent government in \nAfghanistan, terrorists and insurgents continue to threaten the government of \nAfghanistan, the interests of the United States, and those who cooperate with the U.S. \nand the government of Afghanistan.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with his three children living in the United States \nand his strong connections to the United States developed over the last 26 years tends \nto mitigate foreign interest security concerns. Applicant has \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d His children are U.S. citizens, and they \nall reside in the United States. They are fully inculcated with U.S. values. His wife \nattempted to pass the U.S. citizenship examination, but was unable to do so. She has \nserious medical problems and has enjoyed the benefits of advanced U.S. medical \ntherapy and treatments. He has substantial investments in the United States, and no \nproperty or investments in Afghanistan. He has many friends and colleagues in the \nUnited States. He is a loyal, dedicated U.S. citizen. He has provided letters and witness \nstatements to corroborate his loyalty and trustworthiness. Applicant has worked for \ngovernment contractors with dedication and distinction. For more than three years, he \nhas risked his life to support the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. He has put himself in harm\u2019s \nway often, working alongside U.S. forces in numerous military and civil operations. He \nhas made significant contributions to national security, fully aware of the risks to himself. \n \n11In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)) and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding, I conclude that many of these attributes are \npertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept. \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                             \nHe strongly wants to return to his duties with U.S. troops. All these circumstances \ndemonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant promised to report any foreign or terrorist contacts seeking information \nto law enforcement authorities. I found this promise to be sincere and credible. \nHowever, in ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007), the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a PRC Applicant\u2019s clearance \nbecause he gave too much weight to the Applicant\u2019s \u201cstrong ties to the U.S.\u201d and \ndetermined there was insufficient evidentiary support for the conclusion that he \u201ccan be \ntrusted to resolve any conflict of interest . . . in favor of the U.S.\u201d The Applicant in ISCR \nCase No. 06-24575 said he would not act against the U.S. if faced with the choice. \nHowever, the Appeal Board gives such promises little weight in their review of the \nevidence,12 stating: \n \n                                            \n12 Judge White\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations and \nultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes \nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. \n25, 2006) (Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-\nlevel judicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial error). \n \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nAn Applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what he would do in the future is of \nrelatively little weight, given the record in this case. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09053 at (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s stated intention \nabout what he or she might do in the future under some hypothetical set of \ncircumstances is merely a statement of intention that is not entitled to \nmuch weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted \nin a similar manner in the past under similar circumstances.\u201d) \n \nId. at 4. See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) (criticizing the \nadministrative judge\u2019s reliance on PRC-Applicant\u2019s promise to choose the U.S. over \nPRC should a conflict arise, and reversing the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a \nclearance).  I respect the Appeal Board\u2019s position and give little weight to Applicant\u2019s \npromise to report any such contacts that might occur to law enforcement. \n    \nA Guideline B decision concerning the Afghanistan must take into consideration \nthe geopolitical situation in Afghanistan, as well as the dangers existing in \nAfghanistan.13 Afghanistan is a diplomatic and strategic partner of the United States. \nBoth countries have mutual interests and are allies in the war against terrorists and the \nTaliban. The United States has spent billions of dollars and hundreds of U.S. soldiers \nhave been killed assisting Afghanistan against terrorists and the Taliban.  \n \nOne element increasing the foreign influence security concern is Applicant\u2019s \nfrequent contacts with his family in Afghanistan, his spouse\u2019s Afghan citizenship, and \nhis own duties in Afghanistan. He has a close relationship with his family members in \nAfghanistan, and they are vulnerable to terrorist or Taliban coercion and non-coercive \nmeasures because of where they live. Because terrorists and the Taliban violate \nInternational law, they are more likely to use improper and/or illegal means to obtain \nclassified information through Applicant\u2019s family living in Afghanistan.  Applicant shares \nthe dangers of serving in Afghanistan with thousands of U.S. citizens, and thousands of \nthose same U.S. citizens hold security clearances and are subject to coercion to obtain \nclassified information. Under the circumstances of an on-going war involving U.S. forces \nthose dangers are not determinative.     \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant left Afghanistan 29 years ago, and after two years in \nPakistan, he and his wife moved to the United States in 1982. He did not return to \nAfghanistan from 1982 until July 2005, when he went there with the U.S. Army as a \ntranslator. He became a U.S. citizen in 1995. His three children are U.S. citizens. He \nhas approximately 60 relatives who live in the United States. He has a large bank \naccount in the United States and no investments in other countries. Applicant\u2019s closest \nrelatives are his wife and children. All of them live in the United States. His wife has \nmedical problems, and she receives excellent medical care in the United States, \nwhereas such care would not be available in Afghanistan. Applicant is an excellent \nemployee and U.S. citizen. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. \n \n13 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n\n \n18 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nHe was careful during the hearing not to disclose sensitive or classified information \nabout his experiences with the U.S. military forces. He compellingly explained why his \nloyalty is to the United States, rather than to the Afghanistan. Applicant sees the fight \nagainst terrorists, insurgents, and extremists as necessary to protect the quality of life of \nhis family members in Afghanistan. He has repeatedly demonstrated his bravery, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. He has mentally and emotionally resolved the conflict \nbetween the safety of his family and himself from terrorists and his desire to help the \nU.S. military forces. He has repeatedly placed himself in harm\u2019s way to ensure that the \nterrorists will not prevail in the struggle for Afghanistan\u2019s future. He thoroughly \ndeveloped the evidence showing his connections to the United States and to \nAfghanistan. He provided corroborating statements concerning his loyalty and \ntrustworthiness, and favorable recommendations of employers and friends who knew \nhim in the United States and Afghanistan.    \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of his connections to his family living in \nAfghanistan, and to the United States, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of \nfully mitigating the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d14 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n14See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n",

Garcia, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n                                                                            \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A, Administrative Judge:\nOn April 14, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), implemented in September 2006. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested an administrative\ndetermination. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM),\ndated September 17, 2010.  Applicant received the FORM on September 24, 2010, but\n1\ndid not submit a response to the FORM. On November 5, 2010, the Director, DOHA,\nforwarded the case for assignment to an administrative judge. I received the case\nNovember 22, 210\n\n2\nassignment on November 8, 2010. Based on a review of the case file, submissions, and\nexhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding the security concerns\nraised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal activity), and Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement). He denied all  allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1988 and received a diploma from a technical college in March 1992.\nApplicant is divorced and has one child. He has worked for his current employer since\nApril 2007. (Item 6)\nIn 1987, Applicant was arrested twice. In October 1987, he was found guilty of\npetty theft. He spent time in jail. He also admitted that he was charged in November\n1987, with burglary, possession of a controlled substance, and carrying a loaded\nfirearm in public. (Item 10)\nFrom 1987 until 1989, Applicant purchased and used cocaine. (Item 1 and 3) He\nalso used marijuana during those years. (Item 7) He was arrested on five occasions\nbetween 1987 until 1989, on various drug charges. He admits that he was found guilty\non the charges. The convictions were for Possession of a hypodermic needle (syringe).\nHe spent time in jail for each offense. \nApplicant was arrested in February 2006 on four charges, including possession\nof a narcotic drug, possession of a controlled drug, operating with a suspended\nregistration, and open container. Applicant was fined for operating with a suspended\nregistration. The other counts were either dismissed or nolle prosequi. (Item 11)\nWhen Applicant was interviewed in 2007 by an OPM investigator, he\nacknowledged the use of marijuana three or four times a week in 1987. He recalls using\ncocaine on a weekly basis in 1987, and then on a daily basis from April 2005 until July\n2006. Applicant explained that he used cocaine again from 2004 until 2006, because\nhe met an old friend with whom he had used illegal drugs. He elaborated about his\n2006 arrest for drug charges. He told the investigator that he had Valium and was\narrested during a routine traffic stop. (Item 7) However, the police records detail\nApplicant was in possession of a hypodermic needle and a pipe used for smoking crack\ncocaine. (Item 10) \nFinancial\nThe SOR lists delinquent accounts totaling $10,500. Applicant admitted the\ndebts and the credit reports confirm them. (Item 6) He disclosed his delinquent debts on\nhis latest security clearance application. (Item 1)\n\n3\nIn November 2002, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. The\nbankruptcy was discharged in April 2003. (Item 17) There is no information in the record\nas to the origin of the debts or the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy. Applicant\nclaims that the bankruptcy is the result of his 1999 divorce. (Item 6) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge in 2003, he broke his leg in 2005. He\ncould not work from December 2005 until June 2006. However, the broken leg was the\nresult of an auto accident when Applicant was using cocaine. He attributed his\naccumulation of debt to the fact that he was denied workman compensation. From\n2004 until 2006, Applicant admitted using cocaine \u201cmany times.\u201d He attributed this use\nto associating with the wrong crowd. As a result of a 2005 positive drug test, Applicant\nlost his job in 2006. (Item 9) \nWhen OPM interviewed Applicant in October 2007, he explained that he was\nattending a Narcotics Anonymous (NA) program. He denies that he omitted any\nmaterial information concerning possession of the pipe or hypodermic needle. He\nstates that he did not remember the facts or details of the incident. (Item 3)\nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in December 2009. Regarding his\nfinancial situation, he explained that he was starting to pay on his debts. He claimed he\npaid two debts with money from a tax refund (SOR 4.e and 4.f) He promised to start\npayment plans on the SOR debts when he was interviewed in 2007.  \nApplicant\u2019s 2009 monthly net income was $2,759. He states that total monthly\ndebt payments are $150. It would appear that there is a net remainder of $54 in\ndisposable income. (Item 6) He has not received any credit counseling.  \nApplicant states that he has been in recovery for four years. He now lives within\nthe law and has completely changed his life. He states that he pays back his debts as\nbest he can. He also noted that he does not associate with any illegal drug users or has\nany intent to use marijuana or cocaine in the future.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      2\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      3\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      4\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      5\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      6\n Id.\n      7\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe United States Government (Government) must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for\npresenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts\nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is\n2\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion\n3\nis on the applicant.  \n4\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n5\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt\n6\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to deny an individual a\n7\nsecurity clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise \nquestions \nabout an \nindividual's \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical\ncompounds \nidentified \nand \nlisted \nin \nthe\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand\nhallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical\ndirection.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession\nof drug paraphernalia;\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse\nor drug dependence;\n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who, is a staff member of a\nrecognized drug treatment program;\n\n6\n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program\nprescribed by a duly qualified medical professional;\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and,\n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to\nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\nApplicant admitted his use of illegal drugs (marijuana and cocaine) from 1987\nuntil 1989 and again from 2004 until 2006. He used cocaine many times by his own\nadmission. He also tested positive for cocaine in 2006 and lost his job as a result of the\ntest.\nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation;\n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or\nprolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed,\nand abuse has since ended; and,\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment\nprogram, including but not limited to rehabilitation and\naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\nApplicant\u2019s last use of cocaine was in July 2006. This occurred after an\nabstinence of almost 15 years. He met an old friend and decided to use illegal drugs\nagain. He did attend NA in 2006. There is no documentation that he continued\nattending the recovery program. Considering his history of illegal drug use, there is\ndoubt about future use, and not sufficient passage of time for rehabilitation. \n\n7\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for For Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules\nand regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d It also states that \u201can individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant admitted that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002.  Applicant\ncurrently has delinquent debts in the amount of $26,000. Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply. With such conditions raised, it is left to Applicant to overcome the case against\nhim and mitigate security concerns.  \nApplicant had a fresh start in 2002 after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant\nwas unemployed for several months in 2005-2006. After that he was steadily employed.\nThis may have exacerbated Applicant\u2019s ability to meet his obligations, but he provided\nno information about his efforts to otherwise meet those obligations during that period.\nHe has not provided documentation to show he has made any payments on his\ndelinquent accounts. Consequently, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\n(FCMC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\ndoes not apply. As noted, Applicant had a short period of unemployment. He noted that\nhis 1999 divorce caused his initial financial problems. These events, no doubt,\nimpacted his finances. However, there is no evidence that he acted reasonably under\nthe circumstances. He allowed the delinquent debts to remain unpaid. There is no\nrecord of any attempts to resolve his debt until after he received the SOR. \nFC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant has not provided\nevidence of any consistent payment plans. He asserts that he entered a repayment\nplan but has not provided documentation to support this claim. His failure to provide\ninformation about financial counseling obviates the applicability of FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c)\n(the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control).\n\n8\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under\ndishonorable conditions;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted;\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation;\n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a\ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program; and,\n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-\nmartial of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year and incarcerated as a result of that\nsentence for not less than a year. \nApplicant\u2019s arrests and convictions between 1987 and 1989, and again in 2006,\nshow criminal conduct sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). Applicant admitted the\ncrimes. Although Applicant\u2019s latest offense was not serious, it does not diminish the\npattern of criminal behavior. Although there was a gap in time between Applicant\u2019s\ncrimes, he has not shown any insight into his behavior. He has not been successfully\nrehabilitated. His conduct shows a pattern of untrustworthy behavior and his ability and\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. This leaves me with doubts\nabout his judgment and reliability.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, \nor \nit \nhappened \nunder \nsuch \nunusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\n9\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the\nact and those pressures are no longer present in the\nperson's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement; and,\n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may\nnot be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances\nexist, the Secretaries of the Military Departments or\ndesignee; or the Directors of Washington Headquarters\nServices (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),\nNational Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver.\nAfter reviewing the mitigating conditions, I find that none of them apply in this\ncase. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent. He failed to submit sufficient credible evidence to\nshow he has been rehabilitated. Applicant has not provided any information for the\nrecord concerning his employment evaluation record. Although he listed his jobs, he\nprovided no recommendations or performance evaluations demonstrating rehabilitation.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 16(a), a disqualifying conditions exists when there is\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 16(b) a disqualifying condition exists when \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d\n\n10\nApplicant\u2019s 2007 response to an OPM interviewer did not disclose the fact that\npolice found a pipe and hypodermic syringe on his person when he was arrested in\n2006. He claims that he only had Valium. Police records contradict his assertion This is\na misleading statement. In light of his alleged \u201cconfusion\u201d, and past history of\nuntrustworthy behavior, I do not find his explanations credible.  His behavior and\npersonal conduct are disqualifying as they raise questions about his judgment,\nreliability, truthfulness, and willingness to comply with the law.\nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17, I conclude that\nnone of them apply. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct his\nfalsification or concealment. He provided no information that indicates he was ill-\nadvised. The intentional omissions occurred in 2009, and are too recent and serious to\nbe mitigated by the passage of time so far. I have serious doubts about his good\njudgment and reliability. He has not provided information in this record to show that he\nhas met his burden of proof for his personal conduct.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is 42 years old. He has a history of behavior that involves dishonesty.\nHe has not shown successful rehabilitation or demonstrated true insight into his\nbehavior. Applicant currently has unresolved financial difficulties, despite having a fresh\nstart in 2002 after a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Part of his financial difficulties\nstem from a time when he admittedly was unemployed, used cocaine, and lost his job.\nApplicant shows a lack of candor and questionable judgment. Although Applicant\u2019s last\n\n11\noffense was in 2006, I have doubts about his reliability. He did not disclose material\nfacts concerning the 2006 incident when talking to the OPM investigator in 2007.\nIn requesting an administrative determination, Applicant chose to rely on the\nwritten record. In so doing, however, he failed to submit sufficient information or\nevidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding his\ncircumstances, articulate his position, and carry his burden in this process. He failed to\noffer evidence of financial counseling. He failed to provide documentation regarding\nactual payments. I do not find his reasons and explanations credible for his criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the four\nabove referenced guidelines. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2., Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 4.a through 4.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n                                                     \nNOREEN A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 44-year-old credentialing specialist. He was born in Barbados and completed his high school education and some college there. He visited the U.S. on different occasions and married a woman in the U.S. in 1990. He moved to the U.S. permanently in 1993 and was a permanent resident until 2006 when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His daughter was born in the U.S. in 1990. Although she may hold dual citizenship with Barbados because of her parent\u2019s status, no affirmative action has been taken to have her recognized as such. Applicant voluntarily served in the military in Barbados for four years in the rank of private. He no longer has any obligation or commitment to the military.1 Applicant holds a Barbados passport issued to him in 2001, which will expire in 2011. His mother and some other family members live in Barbados. Some of his family members are also U.S. citizens. Applicant kept the passport after becoming a U.S. citizen so he would be able to show proof of his Barbados citizenship when visiting there and so he could access health services with ease, if necessary.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference trustworthiness concerns. \nEligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.  \n \nOn October 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, \nas amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 7, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 30, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 4, 2009, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on February 23, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 2, which were received without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf \n1 \nMarch 4, 2009\n\n2 \n                                                          \nand did not offer any exhibits. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to \nsubmit additional information. Applicant submitted a document, which was marked as \nAE A and was admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 2, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old credentialing specialist. He was born in Barbados and \ncompleted his high school education and some college there. He visited the U.S. on \ndifferent occasions and married a woman in the U.S. in 1990. He moved to the U.S. \npermanently in 1993 and was a permanent resident until 2006 when he became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. His daughter was born in the U.S. in 1990. Although she may \nhold dual citizenship with Barbados because of her parent\u2019s status, no affirmative action \nhas been taken to have her recognized as such. Applicant voluntarily served in the \nmilitary in Barbados for four years in the rank of private. He no longer has any obligation \nor commitment to the military.1 \n \n \nApplicant holds a Barbados passport issued to him in 2001, which will expire in \n2011. His mother and some other family members live in Barbados. Some of his family \nmembers are also U.S. citizens. Applicant kept the passport after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen so he would be able to show proof of his Barbados citizenship when visiting \nthere and so he could access health services with ease, if necessary. Since becoming a \nU.S. citizen he has not been the recipient of health benefits in Barbados. He intends to \nretire in Barbados and may be eligible for certain benefits if he retained his citizenship. \nHe has not voted in an election in Barbados. Since becoming a U.S. citizen he has \nvisited Barbados one time and used his U.S. passport.2  \n \n \nApplicant stated he is willing to renounce his Barbados citizenship.3 Subsequent \nto his hearing Applicant surrendered his Barbados passport to a security official at his \nplace of employment. A confirmation letter was received and stated:  \n \n[Contractor] will secure [Applicant\u2019s] passport in (sic) until either \n[Applicant] request[s] his passport be returned to him or he leaves the \ncompany. [Contractor] will notify the DOHA with all requests [for] \n[Applicant\u2019s] passport while employed with [Contractor].4 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n \n1 Tr. 18-32. \n \n2 Tr. 16, 27-44. \n \n3 Tr. 17-18, 32-33, 45. \n \n4 AE A \n\n3 \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n4 \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference is as follows: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered the following:  \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport; (2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a \nforeign country; (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social \nwelfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country; (4) residence in a \nforeign country to meet citizenship requirements; (5) using foreign \ncitizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country; \nand \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nAt the time of his hearing Applicant held a Barbados passport and considered \nhimself a dual citizen of Barbados and the U.S. He maintained his foreign passport so \nhe could access medical care, if necessary, while visiting Barbados. This is a right of its \ncitizens. Applicant never had to access this benefit, so I find he did not accept a benefit \nfrom Barbados. However, under the circumstances, I find his actions of possessing a \ncurrent foreign passport falls within disqualifying conditions (a) and (b).  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 and especially \nconsidered: \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country;  \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;  \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; and \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.  \n\n5 \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not based solely on his birth in Barbados. He has \nactively considered himself a dual citizen prior to his hearing. He kept his foreign \npassport after he became a U.S. citizen. I find AG \u00b6 11(a) and (c) do not apply. At his \nhearing he expressed his willingness to renounce his Barbados citizenship. He has also \nsurrendered his Barbados passport to his security officer. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6 11(b) \nand (e) apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Applicant is a naturalized \nU.S. citizen. He intends on returning to Barbados one day to retire. He has expressed \nhis willingness to renounce his dual citizenship and has surrendered his foreign \npassport. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public \ntrust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising under the guideline for Foreign Preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant denies using marijuana from 1975 until at least December 2005 or January 2006. He admitted contributing to the purchase of marijuana twice since 2000. He admitted using opium in 1977 and mushrooms in 1981. He admitted using cocaine with varying frequency from 1986 until December 2005 or January 2006. He admitted to taking more than the recommended dosage of prescription painkillers to get high from 2001 until February 2006. He denies purchasing cocaine four times since 2000.

On June 10, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H for drug involvement, \nGuideline E for personal conduct, and Guideline J for criminal conduct.  The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nJune18, 2008.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 27, 2008.  He admitted some and \ndenied others of the allegations.  He requested a hearing before an Administrative \nJudge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on August 6, 2008.  \nThe case was assigned to me on August 7, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nAugust 13, 2008, for a hearing on September 2, 2008.  I convened the hearing as \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nscheduled.  The government offered 12 exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. \nEx.) 1 through 12, which were received without objection.  Applicant submitted two \ndocuments, marked as Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A-B, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on September 11, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and \nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denies using marijuana from 1975 until at \nleast December 2005 or January 2006.  He admitted contributing to the purchase of \nmarijuana twice since 2000.  He admitted using opium in 1977 and mushrooms in 1981.  \nHe admitted using cocaine with varying frequency from 1986 until December 2005 or \nJanuary 2006.  He admitted to taking more than the recommended dosage of \nprescription painkillers to get high from 2001 until February 2006.  He denies \npurchasing cocaine four times since 2000.  Applicant also denies the allegation of false \nanswers on security clearance applications submitted in September 1987, January \n1995, July 2000, and December 2005, as well as a February 11, 2008 affidavit to \nsecurity investigators.  He denies that he was not granted access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) by a government agency in July 2006, that he used \nmarijuana and cocaine after being granted access to classified information in 2002 and \nSCI in 2003, that he violated Air Force policy by using marijuana and cocaine from 1986 \nuntil 1990, and that he used marijuana, cocaine, and improperly used prescription drugs \nafter submitting a security clearance application on December 14, 2005.  He denied the \nresulting criminal conduct for providing false answers.  During the hearing, Applicant \ntestified differently concerning some of his admissions.  Those differences will be \ndiscussed as findings of fact.  I thoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file and the \npleadings.  I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and has been a functional analyst for a defense \ncontractor for about 2 years.  He has an associate's degree in engineering technology, \nand a bachelor's degree in Information Systems Management.  He served four years on \nactive duty with the Air Force from 1986 until 1990.  After his release from active duty \nuntil he started working for his present defense contractor employer, he worked for \nvarious organizations, some of which were government contractors, or was self-\nemployed.  He is married with one child.  Applicant first received a security clearance in \n1987 when he was on active duty with the Air Force.  He has been granted access to \nclassified information at various times since 1987 (Gov. Ex. 9, e-QIP, dated May 23, \n2007; Applicant Exhibit A, Resume, undated).  A friend and former college football team \nmember noted that Applicant overcame numerous injuries to continue to play football at \nthe college level. He worked hard and contributed to his team's success. He has a \nstrong work ethic and is intelligent, resourceful, and energetic.  He favorably impresses \nhis neighbors, church members, colleagues, and business associates.  Applicant's \nability to motivate earns him respect admiration and popularity among his peers \n(Applicant Exhibit B, Letter, undated). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has submitted a number of security clearance applications and has \nbeen interviewed by security investigators various times since 1987.  He has provided \ndifferent information concerning his use of drugs during this process.  In his first security \nclearance application when he entered active duty with the Air Force, Applicant \nanswered \"NO\" to the question concerning use of narcotics (Gov. Ex. 1, Personnel \nSecurity Questionnaire, dated September 16, 1987).  Applicant acknowledged that he \nhad used illegal drugs prior to entering active duty.  However, he states that he was \nadvised by the Air Force recruiter to not list his drug use because it could cause the Air \nForce to question whether he should be accepted on active duty (Tr. 24).  He did not \nreveal any drug use and was granted access to classified information.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a request for access to SCI, was interviewed, and again did \nnot report any use of illegal drugs (Gov. Ex. 2, SCI Screening Interview, notice, \nundated; Gov. Ex. 3, Report of Investigation, dated May 4, 1995; Gov. Ex. 4, Personnel \nSecurity Questionnaire, dated January 31, 1995). He submitted another security \nclearance application for a periodic update of his access to SCI in 2000 and did not \nreport any use of illegal drugs (Gov. Ex. 5, Security clearance application, dated July \n15, 2000). \n \n \nApplicant submitted another security clearance application to a government \nagency for periodic update of his access to SCI on December 14, 2005.  Again, he did \nnot report any illegal drug use.  Applicant was interviewed by security investigators who \nsubmitted Applicant to a polygraph examination.  In the first interview and polygraph on \nFebruary 13, 2006, Applicant reported using marijuana two times when he was 16 years \nold in 1975.  He also reported using a steroid drug while playing college football in 1981.  \nHe admitted using prescription painkillers prescribed for pain after an automobile \naccident in 2004 not for pain relief but to get high.  \n \n \nApplicant was again interviewed and received a polygraph test on March 28, \n2006.  During the interview and test, he listed his use of marijuana to no more than four \ntimes and his use of steroids to no more than five times in a two week period.  He \ndenied abusing prescription medication after August 2004.  He noted that he was \nprescribed painkillers in January 2006 after hand surgery but took the drugs as \nprescribed.  He denied any other illegal drug use.  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed and received a third polygraph test on June 5, 2006.  \nHe now states his use of marijuana was no more than 10 times from 1977 until 1984.  \nHe admitted to assisting with the purchase of marijuana by \"chipping in\" $5 no more \nthan five times.  He admitted using marijuana about 25 times from 1984 until 2000.  He \nadmitted using marijuana from 2000 until the summer of 2005 about five times.  He \nagain \"chipped in\" $5 twice during the times to purchase marijuana.  He further admitted \nto using opium one time in 1977, and mushrooms twice in 1981.  He admitted abusing \nprescription drugs twice in July 2005, and 10 times from 2003 until February 2006.  He \nstopped using prescription drugs in February 2006 because he anticipated having \nsecurity clearance interviews and tests.  He further admitted to using cocaine six times \nform 1986 until 1990, eight times from 1990 until 2000, and four times from 2000 until \nDecember 2005.  He purchased cocaine four times since 2000, and purchased $100 \n\n \n4 \n \nworth of cocaine in December 2005.  He discontinued his use of cocaine in December \n2005 because of his pending security clearance interview and polygraph examination.   \n \n \nBased on these interviews and polygraph tests, Applicant was denied access to \nSCI as a result of his reported drug use (Gov. Ex. 6, Clearance Decision Statement, \ndated July 14, 2006; Gov. Ex. 7, Notification of Denial, dated July 28, 2006).  Applicant's \nappeal of the denial of access to SCI was denied (Gov. Ex. 8, Final outcome of Appeal, \ndated April 24, 2007; See also, Gov. Ex. 12, JPAS history, dated February 25, 2008).   \n \n \nApplicant completed his latest e-QIP on May 23, 2007.  In response to questions \nconcerning his use of illegal drugs, Applicant responded \"YES\" to question 24a asking if \nin the last seven years he illegally used any controlled substance.  He responded \"YES\" \nto question 24b asking if he ever illegally used a controlled substance while in a law \nenforcement position or while possessing a security clearance.  He elaborated on his \nresponse by noting that he used pain killers prescribed by his physician ten times \nbetween September 2001 and February 2002.  He did not indicate if the use was as \nprescribed by the physician or not as prescribed by the physician.  He listed using \ncocaine four times from December 2000 until December 2005.  He listed using \nmarijuana six times from December 2000 until July 2005.  He also answered \"YES\" to \nquestion 26b asking if he had ever been denied or had a security clearance revoked.  \nHe commented that a government agency denied a security clearance in April 2007 for \nfailing to pass a polygraph test because of drug involvement issues (Gov. Ex. 9, e-QIP, \ndated May 23, 2007). \n \n \nIn a November 2007 interview with a security investigator, Applicant stated he \ntried to answer all question in his February 2006 and March 2006 interviews truthfully \nbut in doing so \"split hairs.\"  As an example he cited that in response to questions, he \nstated he may have gotten high from marijuana five times but he may have touched \nmarijuana more than five times but did not smoke that many times and each time he \nsmoked he did not get high.  In his August 2006 interview he told everything about his \ndrug use back to high school.  (Gov. Ex. 10, Affidavit, dated November 29, 2007). \n \n \nIn a February 2008 affidavit provided security investigators, Applicant stated he \nattended a holiday party between Christmas and New Years 2002 and snorted two or \nthree lines of cocaine and smoked a marijuana cigarette.  A party attendee provided the \ndrugs which were openly available.  Only a few people at the party used the drugs.  He \nattended a holiday party between Christmas and New Years 2003 and snorted two or \nthree lines of cocaine and smoked a marijuana cigarette.  He did not pay for any of the \ndrugs since they were passed around the party.  He attended a holiday party between \nChristmas and New Years 2005 and snorted a line of cocaine, and inhaled a marijuana \ncigarette.  The cocaine and marijuana were passed around the party.  Only a few \npeople at the party used the drugs.  He contributed $100 to the party for food, alcohol, \nand drugs.  He attended a party in July 2005 and smoked part of a marijuana cigarette.  \nHe kept part of the cigarette and smoked it in August or September 2005.  He also \nnoted his drug use has not caused him any financial problems or required medical \nattention. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant stated that during his first polygraph test, he was nervous and confused \nabout the interviewer's questions concerning drug use.  He answered truthfully not \nwanting to leave out any information.  His answers to questions changed because the \nquestions asked by the interviewer changed.  In his attempt to answer all questions \ntruthfully in the second interview and polygraph test, the interviewer accused him of \n\"splitting hairs.\"  He made distinctions between touching marijuana, smoking marijuana, \nand getting high from marijuana.  His nervousness increased based on the reaction of \nthe interviewer and his questions.  In his third interview and polygraph test, he disclosed \nhis drug use back to high school.  He was nervous in the interview but tried to answer \ntruthfully the changing questions of the interviewer (Gov. Ex. 11, Affidavit, dated \nFebruary 11, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant provided conflicting information concerning his use of illegal drugs \nduring the September 2, 2008 hearing, based on his definition of drug use.  Applicant \nstated that prior to undergoing the polygraph tests; there was no continued extended \ndrug use.  He considered drug involvement to be at a party and have drugs passed \naround.  He knew he would be tested for drugs because of his employment, so he did \nnot extensively use drugs to cause him to fail any drug tests.  The investigators' \nquestions were always drug use or not drug use and he only had involvement (Tr. 24-\n27).  Applicant stated his last \"use\" of marijuana was in 1994 or 1995.  This answer is \nbased on his definition of \"use\" being a continuing or a number of inhales.  He did not \ncontinuously inhale when he smoked marijuana during the holiday parties in 2002, 2003 \nand 2005 so he does not consider that use of marijuana (Tr. 28-33).  Applicant did not \nequate snorting a line of cocaine at a party to use of cocaine.  He stated that such an \nact was drug experimentation or involvement (Tr. 34-40).  Applicant and Department \nCounsel had the following exchange: \n \n \nA. \"Now if you don't like what I'm saying as far as the words \"use\" \nor \"experimental\" than that lays somewhere else.  But it is not consistent.  \nIt does not make sense with my history of working, my history of being \nable to take a drug test and pass.  But when I tell you my extent, it's made \nout to be--and again bad judgment, but it seems to me that that cannot be \naccepted when in fact that only after it took the poly that in my mind again \nduring that time and it was wrong, bad judgment.  But then again that's \nwhat it was, only a taste, just to say \"Okay, I'm part of the crowd, part of \nthe group.\"  Bad judgment I agree. \n \n \nAfterwards, after the party, in my mind based on that, any \ninvolvement, any involvement, then had to go back and fess up to any \ninvolvement.  Because some way you make the quantum leap from \ninvolvement however limited it is, to drug use and I guess that is my point, \nyes, that is my issue I'm trying to address,\" \n \n \nQ.  when you say \"Involvement\" with let's say marijuana, when you \nsay \"involvement\" are you including a taste of marijuana up to touching it \nor passing it on to someone else? \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA.  That's involvement. \n \n \nQ. Okay.  That's involvement, that's not use. \n \n \nA. That can be use. \n \n \nQ. That can be use? \n \n \nA. That -- involvement, is involvement. \n \n \nQ.  Well, I'm trying to see what you believe in your mind is use \nversus involvement. \n \n \nA.  Sir, I told you.  Let me try one more time and I'm sure where it is \nthat he misunderstanding is.  You asked me about use and if I am using \nthat means I am continually inhaling.  I'm continually snorting to the \npoint\u2026\" (Tr. 41-42).   \n \n \nApplicant went on to explain that a taste of marijuana or a taste of cocaine does \nnot equate to use of marijuana or cocaine.  His \"taste\" was bad judgment but it was not \ndrug use.  It was involvement but it was not use.  Applicant admitted that the last time \nhe took a puff of a marijuana cigarette or snorted a line of cocaine was between \nChristmas and New Years 2004 (Tr. 43-50).  He denied taking a puff of a marijuana \ncigarette or snorting a line of cocaine during the period between Christmas and New \nYears in 2005 because he knew he was going to be tested in February 2006.  He did \nprovide $100 to provide food, alcohol, and drugs for the party (Tr. 50-53).  \n \n \nBased on a reading of the entire record and Applicant's testimony, I find that he is \ntotally without credibility.  Based on all the information in the file, I find that Applicant \nused marijuana at various times from 1975 until late December 2005.  I find that he \ncontributed funds for the purchase of marijuana until at the latest December 2005.  I find \nthat he used opium in 1977 and mushrooms in 1981.  I find that he used cocaine from \n1986 until late December 2005 and purchased cocaine at least four times since 2002.  I \nfind he also took prescription drugs from 2001 until February 2006 for the purpose of \ngetting high and not for the purpose the drugs were prescribed by the physician.   \n \n \nI find Applicant provided false information that he did not use illegal drugs on his \nSeptember 16, 1987, January 31, 1995, July 15, 2000, and December 14, 2005 security \nclearance applications.  He provided false information on his December 14, 2005 \nsecurity clearance application, when he denied using illegal drugs while holding a \nsecurity clearance.  He provided false information to security investigators on February \n11, 2008, when he denied his past use of drugs as noted above.  I also find that a \ngovernment agency denied him access to SCI in July 2006, that he used marijuana \nafter being granted access to classified information and SCI, that he knowingly used \nmarijuana and cocaine in violation of Air Force policy from 1986 until 1990, and that he \nused prescription drugs to get high and not for the intended purpose after submitting a \nsecurity clearance application on December 14, 2005. \n\n \n7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  Drug \nabuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction (AG \u00b6 24). \n \nThe information in the exhibits presented at the hearing by the government and \nApplicant's answers and testify and noted in my findings above are sufficient to raise \nDrug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use), DI DC \nAG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution), and DI DC AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being \ngranted a security clearance.  It is clear that Applicant smoked marijuana and snorted \ncocaine as noted in the SOR.  He admitted use of opium and mushrooms, and also \nused prescription drugs to get high and not for their intended purpose of reducing pain.  \nHis drug-related activities are drug use for security clearance purposes and are not \nsimply drug involvement or drug experimentation.  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the illegal drug use (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15).  An applicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government (See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nApplicant has repeatedly denied that he knowingly used marijuana and cocaine.  \nHe equates his actions of puffing a marijuana cigarette or snorting a line of cocaine as \neither involvement or experimentation because he did not continually use either drug.  \nApplicant's definition of use defies logic and is clearly erroneous.  He used the drugs as \nnoted in the SOR.  I have considered Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) \u00b6 \n26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and DI MC \u00b6 26(b) (a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation).  Applicant failed to \npresent any information to show that his past use of illegal drugs is unlikely to recur and \nthat he no longer associates with known drug users, or now changed or avoided a drug \nuse environment.  He presented no reasonable explanation for his drug-related actions.  \nHis only explanation is to quibble with the definition of the term \"use\" as opposed to his \nbelief that he only was \"involved\" or \"experimented\" with illegal drugs.  He failed to \n\n \n9 \n \npresent sufficient information to meet his heavy burden of establishing that he did not \nknowingly use marijuana, opium, mushrooms, or cocaine, or prescription drugs in an \nillegal manner.  He failed to present sufficient information to show that his drug use \ndoes not raise questions concerning his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  I find against Applicant as to drug \ninvolvement under Guideline H. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.   \n \n \nThe security clearance system depends on the individual providing correct and \naccurate information.  If a person conceals or provides false information, the security \nclearance process cannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified \ninformation is in the best interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s false \nanswers to questions on his security clearance applications concerning drug use and \nhis answers to security investigators raise a security concerns under Personal Conduct \nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, to determine security \neligibility or trustworthiness); and PC DC AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false and \nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative). \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  He states that his answers to questions \non security clearance applications concerning drug use were accurate based on his \ndefinition of the word \"use\".  While there is a security concern for an omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement \nto the government when applying for a security clearance, every omission, \nconcealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be \ndeliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  Applicant's \ndefinition of drug use defies logic and so clearly erroneous that his questioning of the \nword \"use\" can only be to deliberately conceal his use of drugs.  I find that Applicant \ndeliberately provided false information on his security applications and to security \ninvestigators.  \n \n \nI considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 17 \nand determine none apply.  Applicant never made a good faith effort to correct \nerroneous or inaccurate information.  He has not acknowledged that his information was \nfalse.  He merely argued about the definition of the word \"use. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant was denied access to SCI by a government agency, he used marijuana \nand cocaine after being granted access to classified information and SCI, he violated \nthe Air Force policy on drug use, and he used illegal drugs after submitting a security \nclearance application. These actions raise a security concern under PC DC AG 16(d) \n(credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and \nmay not e sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which when combined \nwith all available information supports a whole person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicting that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information. . .).  This conduct shows questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations by \nApplicant.  I have considered the PC MC and find none apply to this conduct. His past \nconduct noted above does not establish or justify confidence that Applicant can be \nentrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  I have considered the Personal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions and find none apply to his past conduct. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30)  Applicant violated federal law by \nknowingly and willfully providing false information on his security clearance application \nand to security investigators (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001).  This conduct raises Criminal Conduct \nDisqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31 (a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses), and CD DC AG \u00b6 31 (c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted).  As noted above, Applicant provided false information repeatedly on security \nclearance applications and to security investigators.  I have considered all of the \nmitigating conditions under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 32 and \ndetermine that none apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n\n \n11 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant served \nfour years on active duty in the Air Force and has held a security clearance for a \nnumber of years.  I considered that his employment record is good and that he has not \ntested positive for drug use.  I considered that Applicant used illegal drugs for many \nyears and then lied about his use on security clearance applications and to security \ninvestigators.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts that \nApplicant will not use illegal drugs in the future.  I have doubts about his eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance because he repeatedly provided false information on \nhis security clearance applications and to security investigators.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his illegal drug \nuse, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a to 2.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 25-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as a research associate engineer since February 2008. He is single and he has no dependents. Applicant worked as a graduate research associate at the university he was attending from October 2005 until about December 2007, and as a mathematics tutor at the same university from September 2003 until June 2005. Applicant immigrated to the United States from Taiwan with his parents and sister in 1999. He was 15 years old at the time. He completed high school in the United States in May 2001, and he immediately enrolled in a major state university. He has earned bachelor of science and master of science degrees in electrical engineering from that 3 university and he is currently working toward his PhD. He anticipates receiving the PhD within the next 12-18 months. Two university professors who have worked closely with Applicant testified and wrote letters on his behalf. (AE 4 and AE 5) They consider Applicant to be hard-working, dedicated and a particularly gifted student. One of the professors recruited him to work as a graduate research associate in the university\u2019s electro-science lab because of the high regard he has for Applicant\u2019s intellectual acumen and technical skill in the field of elec",

Applicant failed\nto mitigate the security concern that arises from his father\u2019s divided residence and\nemployment between Taiwan and China. Clearance is denied. \nOn December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign influence) and C (foreign\npreference). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on\nDecember 31, 2008. He admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.b,\n2.a, and 2.c, denied the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.a, and requested a\nhearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 22, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on February 25, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued\non April 2, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 28, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted 24 documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-24. GE 1-3 were admitted into the record without objection.\nAdministrative notice was taken of the contents of GE 4-24 without objection. Department\nCounsel submitted two documents containing written comments on the contents of GE 4-\n24 which were marked as Appellate Exhibits (App. Ex.) I and II and made part of the record\nwithout objection. \nApplicant testified, called two witnesses to testify on his behalf, and submitted seven\ndocuments that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 1-7. AE 1-6 were admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s objection to AE 7 was overruled and AE\n7 was admitted into the record. Applicant also submitted decisions issued by three other\nadministrative judges for my consideration. Those documents were marked as App. Ex.\nIII-V and are included in the record. \nApplicant\u2019s attempt to surrender his Taiwanese passport at the hearing was refused.\nThe record was held open to provide him the opportunity to submit proof that he\nsurrendered the passport to a proper authority after the hearing was concluded. Two\ndocuments were timely received verifying the destruction and surrender of the destroyed\npassport. Those documents were marked as AE 8 and 9 and admitted into the record\nwithout objection. The transcript was received on June 6, 2009.\nProcedural Matters \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation contained in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.b that he had visited Taiwan, but wrote in his response that he had only\nvisited the country four times since 2000, as opposed to the five times alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.b. At the hearing, Applicant moved to amend his answer to admit he had\nactually visited Taiwan five times since 2000, as alleged in the SOR. That motion was\nallowed without objection.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as\na research associate engineer since February 2008. He is single and he has no\ndependents. Applicant worked as a graduate research associate at the university he was\nattending from October 2005 until about December 2007, and as a mathematics tutor at\nthe same university from September 2003 until June 2005.\nApplicant immigrated to the United States from Taiwan with his parents and sister\nin 1999. He was 15 years old at the time. He completed high school in the United States\nin May 2001, and he immediately enrolled in a major state university. He has earned\nbachelor of science and master of science degrees in electrical engineering from that\n\n3\nuniversity and he is currently working toward his PhD. He anticipates receiving the PhD\nwithin the next 12-18 months.\n  \nTwo university professors who have worked closely with Applicant testified and\nwrote letters on his behalf. (AE 4 and AE 5) They consider Applicant to be hard-working,\ndedicated and a particularly gifted student. One of the professors recruited him to work as\na graduate research associate in the university\u2019s electro-science lab because of the high\nregard he has for Applicant\u2019s intellectual acumen and technical skill in the field of electrical\nengineering. They both vouch that Applicant is trustworthy and deserving of a security\nclearance. They also believe he is a valuable asset to the projects he has been working\non. They also believe his value to those projects will be greatly enhanced if he is granted\na security clearance.\nThe director at Applicant\u2019s place of employment wrote that Applicant is hard-\nworking, trustworthy and of high character. Applicant\u2019s value to his employer would be\ngreatly enhanced if he is granted a secret security clearance. Applicant has been very\ncareful in protecting company proprietary information. (AE 3) An associate professor at the\nuniversity Applicant attends has known him for the past seven years because they are\nmembers of the same church. He has found Applicant to be sincere, reliable, trustworthy\nand a loyal United States citizen. (AE 6)\n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States. He became a\nnaturalized United States citizen on December 13, 2005, and he obtained a United States\npassport on January 25, 2006.  He registered with the United States Selective Service\nSystem in August 2001. He has voted in United States elections but not in Taiwanese\nelections. Applicant is willing to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship, but has not done so\nbecause he believes it is a long and complicated process and might have the undesired\neffect of causing him to be conscripted into the Taiwanese military to serve the mandatory\nmilitary service required of all Taiwanese men. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are residents of the United States and dual citizens\nof Taiwan and the United States. His mother became a naturalized citizen in 2005, and his\nsister in or about 2006. Applicant\u2019s mother is 59 years old. She did not work outside the\nhome for many years after she immigrated to the United States. However, she now works\nas a sales associate at a large department store. Applicant\u2019s sister is 30 years old. She\nobtained a PhD from a university in the United States. She is married to a United States\ncitizen and is presently a homemaker.\nApplicant\u2019s father immigrated to the United States with the rest of his family, but\nshortly thereafter he returned to Taiwan. He apparently decided he could not find suitable\nemployment in the United States and it was in the best interest of his family for him to\nreturn to his job in Taiwan to provide support for them. He was working as a mechanical\nengineer exclusively in Taiwan until about 2007 when he took a job with a company that\nhas manufacturing facilities in China. His work responsibilities now require that he work and\nreside in China for more than half the year. While in China, Applicant\u2019s father resides in a\ndormitory-type facility that is owned by his employer. \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s father is 61 years old. Applicant\u2019s family hopes that his father will be able\nto retire within the next few years. They anticipate he will again immigrate to the United\nStates once he is able to retire. Applicant\u2019s father owns a residence in Taiwan, but his\nfather resides with his parents in Taiwan when he is not working in China. For unexplained\nreasons, the residence owned by Applicant\u2019s father is vacant.\nApplicant works in a city that is a about an hour and a half drive from the city where\nhis mother lives and where he is working on his PhD. He has an apartment in the city\nwhere he works and stays there during the work week. He resides with his mother on\nweekends. Applicant used to speak with his father by telephone about two to three times\na month. Now, his mother will call Applicant\u2019s father about once a month while Applicant\nis staying at her house, and those are the only times Applicant speaks with his father.\nApplicant does not have any other contact with his father except on the occasions when\nhe visited Taiwan. \nApplicant\u2019s father served two years of mandatory military service in Taiwan\nsometime in the 1960s. Other than his father\u2019s service, none of Applicant\u2019s family members\nhave ever worked for the Taiwanese government or held official government positions in\nTaiwan.   \nApplicant visited Taiwan once in 2000, twice in 2001, once in 2002, and once in\n2006. He stayed with his elderly paternal grandparents during his visits to Taiwan. The\npurpose of the first four visits was simply to vacation during school breaks. The last visit\nwas to see his grandparents who are in their 90s because Applicant believed it might be\nthe last chance he would get to see them before they die. Applicant does not have any\nother close relatives or friends in Taiwan. Applicant telephones his grandparents a few\ntimes a year, generally on important holidays.  \nApplicant renewed his Taiwanese passport in 2005. That passport expired in May\n2008, and has now been destroyed and surrendered to his employer. Applicant used his\nTaiwanese passport to enter and exit Taiwan during his 2006 visit to Taiwan despite the\nfact that he was a United States citizen and had obtained a United States passport at the\ntime. He used the Taiwanese passport because he did not have to obtain a visa by so\ndoing and to minimize the risk he would be involuntarily conscripted into the Taiwanese\nmilitary during the visit.   \nApplicant does not currently have any plans to travel to Taiwan. He is concerned\nthat if he were to travel to Taiwan he might be involuntarily conscripted into the military. He\nis uncertain about traveling to Taiwan when his grandparents die or if his father becomes\ngravely ill again because of concerns about military conscription.    \nTaiwan is a stable democracy with a strong and well-developed economy. (GE 5)\nHowever, in 1979 the United States changed its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to\nChina. (GE 4) Since then, absent diplomatic relations, the United States has maintained\neconomic and security relationships with Taiwan, including the sale of defensive military\nweapons and services. (GE 6) \n\n5\nOver the past several years, Taiwan has relaxed restrictions on unofficial contacts\nwith China, and cross-Strait interaction has mushroomed. China is Taiwan\u2019s largest trading\npartner, and Taiwan is China\u2019s fifth-largest. Estimates of Taiwan investment on the\nmainland, both officially approved by Taiwan authorities and investment made by Taiwan\nfirms through third parties, start from $100 billion, making Taiwan and Hong Kong the two\nlargest investors. (GE 4) \nChina is a Communist party-led state. It has a well-documented and continuing\npractice of abusing human rights in violation of internationally recognized norms, stemming\nboth from the authorities\u2019 intolerance of dissent and the inadequacy of legal safeguards for\nbasic freedoms. (GE 18) \nThe Ministry of State Security (MSS) is the preeminent civilian intelligence collection\nagency in China. The primary operational focus of the MSS is \u201cTaiwan work,\u201d namely,\nconducting intelligence activities against Taiwan in every intelligence and covert political\naction arena. The \u201cThird Bureau\u201d of the MSS has geographical intelligence responsibility\nfor operations in Taiwan. The main activities of the Third Bureau in Taiwan include agent\noperations and recruitment of Chinese nationals with Taiwan connections. (GE 17) \nThe United Statres is a primary intelligence target of China. (GE 19) China has\nobtained access to restricted foreign technologies through industrial espionage and it\noperates an aggressive clandestine effort to acquire additional technologies. This has\nbecome such a problem in the United States that U.S. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the\nleading threat to the security of U.S. technology. (GE 20) The U.S.-China Economic and\nSecurity Review Commission\u2019s 2007 Report to Congress concluded that Chinese\nespionage activities in the United States are so extensive that they comprise the single\ngreatest risk to the security of American technologies. (GE 20) \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline C (foreign preference), with\ntheir disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n6\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are dual citizens of the United States and Taiwan.\nOther than Applicant\u2019s testimony indicating his mother has regular phone contact with her\nhusband, there is no record evidence to indicate his mother and/or sister have any\ncontinuing ties to Taiwan. Their dual citizenship, in and of itself, does not create a foreign\ninfluence security concern. \nApplicant\u2019s father returned to Taiwan shortly after the family immigrated to the\nUnited States. He has remained in Taiwan and worked there and in China since. He\ncurrently spends over half of each year working and residing in China. Applicant\u2019s father\nresides with his parents when he is in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s mother maintains contact with\nher husband and the entire family anticipates that he will eventually retire and return to\nreside in the United States. Applicant had telephonic contact with his father two to three\ntimes a month until relatively recently and now still speaks with him by telephone about\nonce a month. During his visits to Taiwan, Applicant stayed at his grandparents home\nwhich is also his father\u2019s residence when he in not working and living in China.\nThe United States is a primary intelligence target of China and China operates an\naggressive clandestine effort to acquire additional technologies. U.S. Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities\nas the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology. Chinese espionage activities in the\nUnited States are so extensive that they comprise the single greatest risk to the security\nof American technologies. Additionally, China\u2019s MSS conducts intelligence activities against\nTaiwan in every intelligence and covert political action arena. The Third Bureau of the MSS\nactivities in Taiwan include agent operations and recruitment of Chinese nationals with\nTaiwan connections. \n \nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant\u2019s father has ever acted in\nany way that might harm any interest of the United States. However, his divided residence\nand employment in Taiwan and China places him in a position where there is a heightened\nrisk that he and/or Applicant could be targeted and/or exploited by foreign collection\nactivities directed against the United States. Applicant\u2019s personal relationship with his\nfather and through his mother, with whom he resides part-time, create security concerns\nunder Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a): contact with a foreign family member . . . or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nand DC 7(d): sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion. \nI have considered the possible application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 8(a): the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\nand MC 8 (c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence of exploitation.\nHaving done so, I conclude the continuing relationship Applicant and his mother have with\nhis father, including regular phone contact and an expectancy that his father will retire and\n\n8\njoin them in the United States, and the father\u2019s divided residence and work between\nTaiwan and China preclude application of these mitigating conditions.\nI have also considered the possible application of MC 8(b): there is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person\n. . . is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest. Applicant, his mother and his sister retain their dual citizenship\nwith Taiwan. Each has been a United States citizen for less than four years. Applicant has\njust begun to pursue a professional career in the United States and his mother just\nrelatively recently began to work outside the home. Their anticipation that Applicant\u2019s father\nwithin a few years will retire and join them in the United States exhibits the continuing\nfather-son and husband-wife relationship they feel toward Applicant\u2019s father despite the\nyears of separation. There is no to reason to question or doubt Applicant\u2019s professed\nallegiance and loyalty to the United States to the exclusion of all other countries. However,\nthere is insufficient evidence from which to conclude how Applicant would resolve any\nconflict of interest were it to arise. Accordingly, I conclude this mitigating condition does not\napply. The remaining mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts of this case.\n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nForeign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nUnited States.\nApplicant\u2019s vacations to Taiwan in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2006 were strictly for\npleasure and to visit with his father and grandparents. They do not indicate a preference\nfor Taiwan over the United States and do not create a foreign preference security concern.\nNo disqualifying condition applies to Applicant\u2019s travel to Taiwan.\nApplicant became a naturalized United States citizen in December 2005, and he\nobtained a United States passport in January 2006. Still, he used the Taiwanese passport\nhe had obtained before he became a United States citizen to enter and exit Taiwan in\n2006. The use of a foreign passport is the exercise of the right of foreign citizenship.\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 10(a): exercise of any right, privilege or obligation or foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember applies.\nApplicant acquired his Taiwanese citizenship through his parents. He moved to the\nUnited States when he was a teenager and, with the exception of the use of the Taiwanese\npassport, has done nothing to indicate a preference for Taiwan over the United States.\nIndeed, he registered with the United States Selective Service System while he was still\nsolely a Taiwanese citizen, he has voted in United States elections but not Taiwanese\nelections, he applied for and became a United States citizen almost as soon as he was\neligible, he destroyed and surrendered the Taiwanese passport when he learned its\npossession created a security concern, and he has expressed his willingness to renounce\nhis Taiwanese citizenship.\n\n9\nMC 11(a): dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry; MC 11(b): the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship:\nand MC 11(e): the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated all apply. Application of these mitigating conditions to\nApplicant\u2019s isolated exercise of the right of his Taiwanese citizenship is sufficient to find he\nhas mitigated the foreign preference concern that existed.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d In this case, there is no reason to doubt that Applicant is a loyal American\ncitizen or suspect he would consider doing harm to the interests of the United States. Still,\nhis father\u2019s divided residence and work between Taiwan and China create a security\nconcern that has not been overcome.    \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nforeign influence security concern that exists in this case. He has failed to overcome the\ncase against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline C is decided for\nApplicant. Guideline B is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admission to the one SOR allegation is incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 49 years old. She has been employed as a project manager by a defense contractor since 2007. She was employed outside the defense industry as a senior business analyst by an insurance company from 1982 until 2002, and by a state educational association from August 2003 to 2007. She cleaned houses from 2002 to 2003. Applicant was earning $35-40,000 annually at the insurance company when she lost her job due to the company downsizing. She was earning about $85,000 at the education association when she left to take her present position to avoid the possible loss of employment as her employer was reorganizing. Her current salary is about $72,500 annually. Applicant graduated from high school in 1977. She attended college from 1977-80, but did not obtain a degree. She has been married and divorced three times. Her first marriage was terminated on September 8, 1987; her second marriage was terminated on July 10, 1996; and her last marriage was terminated on February 14, 2006. Applicant has two children.

She has\nsatisfied most of her delinquent creditors and she is making payments under a repayment\nagreement she entered into with the Internal Revenue Service. \nOn October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing to Applicant its trustworthiness concerns.  The\n1\nSOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on November 12, 2008. She\nadmitted the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.e, denied the allegations\ncontained in subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d, and requested a hearing. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMarch 23, 2009\n\n Department Counsel did not object to the admission of any document submitted by Applicant, but\n2\ndid ask that I limit the weight to be given to those items I have marked as AE 22 and AE 24-28 because they\nare not signed by either Applicant or her ex-husband. AE 22 has no bearing on my decision. AE 24-28 are\ncopies of individual and corporate tax returns, each of which were prepared and/or signed by an accountant.\nW hile I do not find it unusual that the copy of a tax return prepared by an accountant and retained by an\nindividual would be unsigned, I will consider the fact that they are unsigned and accord them the appropriate\nweight they deserve in arriving at my decision.  \n2\nThe case was assigned to me on December 15, 2008. A notice of hearing was\nissued on December 22, 2008, scheduling the hearing for January 15, 2009. An amended\nnotice of hearing was issued on January 5, 2009, rescheduling the hearing to February 12,\n2009. The hearing was rescheduled to coordinate it with the scheduling of additional\nhearings I received that were to be heard in the same general area. The government\nsubmitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4\nand admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted twelve\ndocumentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-12 and admitted into\nthe record without objection. The record was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity\nto submit additional documentation in support of her case. Eighteen documents were\ntimely received, marked as AE 13-30 and admitted into the record without objection.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum was marked as App. Ex. I  and is included\n2\nin the file. The transcript was received on February 24, 2009.      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admission to the one SOR allegation is incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old. She has been employed as a project manager by a\ndefense contractor since 2007. She was employed outside the defense industry as a\nsenior business analyst by an insurance company from 1982 until 2002, and by a state\neducational association from August 2003 to 2007. She cleaned houses from 2002 to\n2003. Applicant was earning $35-40,000 annually at the insurance company when she lost\nher job due to the company downsizing. She was earning about $85,000 at the education\nassociation when she left to take her present position to avoid the possible loss of\nemployment as her employer was reorganizing. Her current salary is about $72,500\nannually.\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1977. She attended college from 1977-80,\nbut did not obtain a degree. She has been married and divorced three times. Her first\nmarriage was terminated on September 8, 1987; her second marriage was terminated on\nJuly 10, 1996; and her last marriage was terminated on February 14, 2006. Applicant has\ntwo children. Her daughter, born of her first marriage, is 23 years old; and her son, born\nof her third marriage, is eight years old. Applicant shares joint custody of her son with his\nfather. The joint custody arrangement includes an equal division of time spent by the boy\nresiding with each parent, and requires the boy\u2019s father to pay Applicant $127 per month\nfor child support.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband lost his job with a trucking company in September 2000.\nThey downsized, including selling their house and moving to a smaller residence. In May\n2002, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband purchased a trucking business with another couple who\nwere apparently only investors in the enterprise. The business was set up as a Subchapter\nS Corporation with Applicant, her ex-husband and the other two parties each allocated a\n25% interest in the corporation. Applicant\u2019s ex-husband was installed as the president of\nthe company and he solely operated the business while Applicant and the other couple\nfunctioned as no more than silent partners.\nThe trucking business tax return for the year 2002 (AE 25) lists gross receipts of\n$1,184,233, compensation paid to officers of $20,000, salaries and wages of $462,640,\nand taxable income of $25,902. Applicant\u2019s individual tax return for 2002 (AE 24), filed\njointly with her ex-husband, lists wages of $77,454, unemployment compensation of\n$13,299, and adjusted gross income of $91,180.\n \nThe trucking business tax return for the year 2003 (AE 28) lists gross receipts of\n$1,329,013, compensation paid to officers of $80,000, salaries and wages of $385,887,\nand taxable income of $66,333. Applicant\u2019s individual tax return for 2003 (AE 26), filed\njointly with her ex-husband, lists wages, etc., of $113,818, an IRA distribution of $78,404,\npensions and annuities of $231,403, and adjusted gross income of $209,191.\nApplicant\u2019s 2004 individual tax return (AE 30) was filed as head of household and\nseparate from her ex-husband. It lists wages, etc., of $76,349, taxable pension of $10,000,\nSubchapter S Corporation income of $45,195, and adjusted gross income of $132,359. It\nalso indicates an underpayment of federal income tax in the amount of $5,877. \nSOR subparagraph 1.a lists a delinquent credit card debt owing in the amount of\n$45,424 that was charged off as a bad debt. The account was opened in July 2003, and\nthe date of last activity listed in Applicant\u2019s CBRs for the account is September 2005.\nApplicant satisfied this account fully in September 2008, by paying the creditor a negotiated\nsettlement in the amount of $14,100. \nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b is a credit card debt owing in the amount\nof $9,676 that was charged off as a bad debt. This account was opened in July 2004, and\nthe date of last activity listed in Applicant\u2019s CBRs for the account is September 2005.\nApplicant satisfied this account fully in October 2008, by paying the creditor a negotiated\nsettlement in the amount of $3,300. \nSOR subparagraph 1.c lists another credit card debt owing in the amount of $22,863\nthat was charged off as a bad debt. This account was opened in September 2004, and the\ndate of last activity listed for this account is September 2005. Applicant satisfied this\naccount fully in January 2008, by paying the creditor a negotiated settlement in the amount\nof $6,700.  \nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d is another credit card debt owing in the\namount of $8,104. This account was transferred from a department store to the collection\nagency that is listed as the creditor in the SOR. The account was opened with the store in\n\n Applicant actually owed $24,387.45 on this debt as of January 7, 2008 (GE 2). Thus, she has\n3\nreduced this indebtedness by substantially more than is indicated by simply comparing the amount listed in\nthe SOR with the balance that was still owing in February 2009.\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n4\n4\nFebruary 2003, and the date of last activity on the account with the store, as listed in\nApplicant\u2019s CBR dated January 11, 2008 (GE 4), is September 2005.\nThe last debt listed in the SOR is for Applicant\u2019s unpaid federal income taxes,\npenalties and interest for the tax year ending December 31, 2005, owing in the amount of\n$20,564. Applicant has entered into a repayment agreement with the Internal Revenue\nService under which she is making monthly payments of $301. As of February 4, 2009, the\namount owing had been reduced to $19,802.36.   \n3\nApplicant obtained the funds to settle the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a -\n1.d by withdrawing money from her retirement accounts and as a gift from a friend. She\nis under no obligation to repay the gift, but testified she will when and if she has the funds\navailable. She still has approximately $35,000 in retirement accounts, but virtually no other\nsavings. Her monthly expenses leave her with very little discretionary income.\nApplicant attributes her financial problems to the separation from her now ex-\nhusband, the ensuing divorce, the legal expenses and debt allocation she incurred from\nthe divorce, and her anticipation of a sizable settlement from the divorce that was not\nforthcoming. Specifically, Applicant expected to receive as much as $500,000 as her share\nof the trucking business. Instead, she received nothing from the business. She was\nassigned all personal debt while her ex-husband was assigned the business debt. Her\nattorney\u2019s fees in connection with the divorce were over $38,000.\nApplicant testified the credit card debt she accumulated was incurred because\npayment of her legal expenses did not leave her with sufficient funds on which to live.\nBecause she had expected to receive a sizable distribution from the business, she was not\nconcerned about the debt she was accumulating. The letter from her attorneys, dated\nOctober 28, 2005 (AE8), corroborates her testimony, particularly where they wrote: \u201cThe\nbusiness valuation was lower than we had hoped. . . . When we received the business\nvaluation, we had a very difficult turning point in your case.\u201d Further supporting Applicant\u2019s\nclaim of her overall financial responsibility and the situational nature of the delinquent debt\nlisted in the SOR is the fact that her January 11, 2008 CBR (GE 4), lists 47 account that\nwere opened between January 1987 and December 2006, in which the method of payment\nis described as \u201cPays as Agreed.\u201d   \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n4\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\n\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n5\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n6\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n7\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n8\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n9\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n5\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.5\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n6\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.7\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d  The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.8\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n9\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n10\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant had four delinquent credit card debts that were either charged off as bad\ndebts or submitted for collection. The amount owing on those accounts was over $85,000.\n\n6\nShe also had delinquent federal income taxes for the tax year ending December 31, 2005,\nthat were owing in the amount of $20,564. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\nApplicant properly attributes her financial problems to her separation from her now\nex-husband and their ensuing 2006 divorce. She reasonably anticipated a large settlement\nfrom the business she and her ex-husband owned with another couple. She reasonably\ndid not anticipate the very large attorney\u2019s fees she incurred in obtaining the divorce or the\nallocation of all personal debt to her. She has now satisfied all debt listed in the SOR with\nthe sole exception of the delinquent taxes. She has entered into a repayment agreement\nwith the IRS and she reduced the amount she owed to the IRS by about $4,500 between\nJanuary 2008 and February 2009. \nApplicant has a long history of steady employment in very responsible positions.\nDuring the brief period she was between jobs in those responsible positions, Applicant\nsupported her family by cleaning houses. Most significantly, Applicant has a long history\nof living a financially responsible lifestyle and paying her bills in a timely manner as\ndocumented in her January 2008 CBR.\nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC\n20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (. . . divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances; and MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts apply.\n \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nher acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. She has overcome the case against her and\nsatisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant access to sensitive information. Guideline F is decided\nfor Applicant.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public\ntrust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is a 35 year old security specialist working for a defense contractor. She married in 1992, separated in 1999, and her divorce was final in 2002. She has one child. The financial burden from the marriage and the care of her daughter was left to Applicant. Her former husband has not kept current with the child support payments required under the divorce. After marrying in 1992, Applicant worked several jobs for local law enforcement agencies until December 2004. She then worked for a Department of Defense agency in a temporary general service position for two years until the contract was terminated in January 2006. Applicant returned to work with local law enforcement agencies until she started employment with her present defense contractor employer in January 2007. During some of this time, she worked two jobs. During this time, she was continuously employed except for a nine month period. Her yearly salary also fluctuated from about $36,000 to $20,000. Applicant is working in a temporary position for her employer awaiting a clearance decision. Her present net monthly salary is approximately $1,600 with monthly expense of approximately $1,200. This leaves her with monthly discretionary or disposable funds of $400 (Tr. 18-19, 54- 57, 63-66, and 79-81). Credit reports and Applicant's admissions show the following delinquent debts: a $38",

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on August 9, 2007, as part of her employment with a defense contractor. On \nMay 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns about financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 21, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 9, 2009. She admitted 28 and \ndenied two of the Guideline F allegations with explanation, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July \n22, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on July 24, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on August 13, 2009, for a hearing on September 1, 2009. Applicant signed for \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe Notice of Hearing on August 20, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \ngovernment offered nine exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 9, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant and one witness testified on her \nbehalf. She offered two exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A and B which \nwere received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nSeptember 10, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August 20, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of September 1, 2009, prior to the mailing of a \nNotice of Hearing. Accordingly, actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the \nhearing.  However, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 11 days prior to the \nhearing. She waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 8-9). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 35 year old security specialist working for a defense contractor. \nShe married in 1992, separated in 1999, and her divorce was final in 2002. She has one \nchild. The financial burden from the marriage and the care of her daughter was left to \nApplicant. Her former husband has not kept current with the child support payments \nrequired under the divorce. After marrying in 1992, Applicant worked several jobs for \nlocal law enforcement agencies until December 2004. She then worked for a \nDepartment of Defense agency in a temporary general service position for two years \nuntil the contract was terminated in January 2006. Applicant returned to work with local \nlaw enforcement agencies until she started employment with her present defense \ncontractor employer in January 2007. During some of this time, she worked two jobs. \nDuring this time, she was continuously employed except for a nine month period. Her \nyearly salary also fluctuated from about $36,000 to $20,000. Applicant is working in a \ntemporary position for her employer awaiting a clearance decision. Her present net \nmonthly salary is approximately $1,600 with monthly expense of approximately $1,200. \nThis leaves her with monthly discretionary or disposable funds of $400 (Tr. 18-19, 54-\n57, 63-66, and 79-81). \n \nCredit reports and Applicant's admissions show the following delinquent debts: a \n$38 credit card account in collection (SOR 1.a); another credit card account in collection \nwith the same creditor for $466 (SOR 1.b); a student loan more than 180 days \ndelinquent for $859 (SOR 1.c); a financial company loan charged off for $1,483 (SOR \n1.d); a cell phone account in collection for $798 (SOR 1.e); a credit card debt in \ncollection for the same creditor listed at SOR 1.a for $2,131 (SOR 1.f); a utility debt in \ncollection for $99 (SOR 1.g); a credit card debt to the same creditor list at SOR 1.b in \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncollection for $2,762 (SOR 1.h); a furniture company account in collection for $533 \n(SOR 1.i); medical accounts in collection to the same creditor for $95 (SOR 1.j), $100 \n(SOR 1.k), $235 (SOR 1.l), and $315 (SOR 1.m); a medical account in collection for a \ndifferent creditor for $50 (SOR 1.n); a credit card debt in collection for $3,183 (SOR \n1.o); a collection account for $480 (SOR 1.p); a medical debt in collection for $1,432 \n(SOR 1.q); two accounts in collection to the same collection agent for a video store for \nthe same amount of $42 (SOR 1.s, and 1.t); a medical debt in collection for $54 (SOR \n1.u); a cell phone account in collection for $1,541 (SOR 1.v); a television service \naccount in collection for $246 (SOR 1.w); a store account in collection for $432 (SOR \n1.x); two medical debts in collection to the same creditor for $170 (SOR 1.y) and $55 \n(SOR 1.z); a financial company loan in collection for $328 (SOR 1.aa); a medical debt in \ncollection for $75 (SOR 1.bb); a photography studio account in collection for $56 (SOR \n1.cc); and a medical account in collection for $17 (SOR 1.dd; Gov. Ex. 6 Credit report, \ndated February 12, 2004; Gov. Ex. 7, Credit report, dated September 12, 2007; and \nGov. Ex. 8, Credit report, dated December 13, 2008).  \n \nThe delinquent debts listed at SOR 1.a, and 1.b are for two different credit cards \nwith the same creditor for $536 and $466. The delinquent debts listed at SOR 1. f and \n1.h are for the same accounts. With interest and penalties added to the original \namounts, the debts are now $2,131 and $2,762. Applicant had three credit cards issued \nby this creditor after her divorce. One account was never used. She disputes the \namounts owed on the other two accounts, claiming there was never more than $500 as \na balance owed on the cards. She has written to the creditors asking them to verify the \naccounts but has not received replies. Applicant has not made any payments on the two \ncards she did use (Tr. 33-37, 70-72; Gov. Ex. 4, Letters, dated June 8, 2009).  \n \nThe delinquent debt listed at SOR 1.c is for student loans. Applicant's student \nloans were in deferment, but are now delinquent. Applicant owes approximately $7,700 \nin defaulted student loans. She received an offer to pay a certain amount each month \nfor a number of months so the loans can be considered for deferment if she returned to \nschool. She is unable to pay the monthly amount and has not made the payments on \nthe student loans (Tr. 57-63, 73). \n \nThe delinquent debt listed at SOR 1.d is for a loan. She stated she is confused \nby the credit reports and is unsure of the debt and the creditor. Applicant has not made \nany payment arrangements with the creditor (Tr. 51-54, 73-74).  \n \nThe delinquent debt listed at SOR 1.e is for a cell phone. Applicant sent a letter \nto the creditor requesting verification of the amount of the debt owed. She does not \ndispute that she has a debt, but wants verification of the amount of the debt (Tr. 74). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.g was paid in full (Tr. 23, Gov. Ex. 4, Account history, \nJune 10, 2009).  \n \nDelinquent debt at SOR 1.i is to a collection agency for furniture Applicant \npurchased after her divorce. She sent a letter to the collection company requesting \n\n \n4 \n \n \nvalidation of the amount of the debt. She has not received information in response from \nthe collection agency. She does not dispute the debt but does dispute the amount owed \n(Tr. 37-39; Gov. Ex. 4, Letter, dated June 8, 2009). \n \nSome of the medical debts are for Applicant's daughter. Her former husband is \nresponsible for the daughter's medical care. The debts at SOR 1.j, 1.k., 1.l, 1.m, are the \ndaughter's medical debts that are the responsibility of her former husband (Tr. 68-70). \nHowever, the medical debts at SOR 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t. and 1.u, 1.y, 1.z, 1.bb, and 1.dd \nare Applicant's medical debt for her own treatment. She paid the debts listed at 1.r, 1.s, \n1.t, 1.u, 1.y. 1.z, 1.bb, and 1.dd. (Tr. 70-72, 78-79; Gov. Ex. 4, Account statement, dated \nJune 10, 2009). \n \nDelinquent debt 1.n is for a medical debt. Applicant tried to resolve this debt but \nhas not been able to locate the creditor. The collection agency informed her that the \ndebt is with the original creditor, but she does not have contact information for the \ncreditor (Tr. 74-75). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.o is for a credit card Applicant and her former husband \nused while they were married. When Applicant and her husband divorced, he accepted \nresponsibility for only three marital debts. This credit card debt was left with Applicant to \nresolve. She has not made any payment on the card since she did not have sufficient \nfunds to pay the debt (Tr. 66-69). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.p is in collection for the original creditor. Applicant \nwrote the collection agency requesting information on the account. She has not \nreceived a reply. She has not made any payments on this account (Tr. 75-76; Gov. Ex. \n4, Letter, dated June 8, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.v is for a cell phone. Applicant had service in the \npast with the company. She recently opened a new account with the company. She was \nnot told of any outstanding balance owed. She wrote the creditor asking to verify the \namount of the debt. She has not received a reply (Tr. 76-77). \n \nDelinquent debt 1.w is a debt in collection for a cable television company. \nApplicant admitted that she owes the debt and that she would resolve it in the future (Tr. \n77-78). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.x for $432 has been paid in full. Department \ncounsel has agreed that the debt was paid in full (Tr. 22, 78; Gov. Ex. 8, Credit report, \ndated December 13, 2008 at 2-3). \n \nThe delinquent debt listed at SOR 1.aa is for a loan. Applicant's mother paid this \naccount in 2006 when Applicant lost her government job. The creditor notes that the \ndebt has been deleted from the credit report as being over seven years old. Since the \ndebt is not over seven years old, I find that the debt was paid by Applicant's mother (Tr. \n25-27, 78-79; App. Ex. A, Letter, dated June 30, 2009). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at 1.bb and 1.dd are medical debts that have been paid as \nnoted above. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.cc is for a photography company. Applicant \npaid the debt, but does not have a receipt (Tr. 78-79). \n \nApplicant's immediate supervisor testified that he is the program manager for his \ncompany's programs dealing with personnel and guard service contracts. He hired \nApplicant in 2007 as a person ideally suited to work in visitor processing and security \nscreening. Applicant has done an outstanding job and has assisted him with the training \nof new personnel. She is quite exceptional since she does not make mistakes. She has \nreceived written commendation from visitors, government customers, and company \npersonnel. Since her security clearance was questioned, she has not worked in the \ngovernment area. However, the government contacts that she worked for have asked \nthat she be reinstated into their area as soon as possible. She has excellent rapport \nwith the customers and has assisted them in the past to pass their security screening \nassessments. He finds her trustworthy, reliable, and believes she should have access to \nclassified information. He attached to his letter of recommendation, letters of \nappreciation he received from senior government supervisors praising the excellent \nsupport they and their staffs received from Applicant (Tr. 94-98; App. Ex. B, Letter of \nRecommendation, dated August 31, 2009). \n \nApplicant presented four letters of recommendation. Her congressman wrote that \nhe has known Applicant and her family for over 25 years. He notes that she has been \ntrying to resolve her financial problems arising from a broken marriage, raising a \ndaughter as a single mother, without financial help from her former husband. He \nbelieves her actions reflect on her good character. The government facility manager at \nthe base supported by Applicant's company notes that Applicant is the one he seeks \nwhen resolving any security crisis. Applicant is smart and understands the system. She \nprovides him with excellent customer service and support. The lead contractor for \nApplicant's employer notes that she is dependable, conscientious, and trustworthy. \nWhenever she is needed, Applicant is there to help. A security specialist for the \ngovernment noted that she works closely with Applicant. Applicant's most remarkable \ntrait is her trustworthiness. Applicant has worked with classified information and she has \nbeen exceptional in safeguarding the sensitive information. (Gov. Ex. 4, Letters, various \ndates).  \n \n`Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are still required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n6 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as listed on credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Twelve of the debts, mostly \nsmall medical debts, have been paid. One other debt for which Applicant has no receipt \nhas been paid. Four other debts were for Applicant's daughter's medical care, and the \nresponsibility of her former husband. The twelve remaining debts have not been paid. \nOn one of these debts, Applicant has insufficient information to determining a creditor.   \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony concerning the delinquent debts. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances) have some application to Applicant's circumstances. The \nunpaid debts are considered current debts. While Applicant is a single mother raising a \nteen age daughter, she has not taken sufficient actions to resolve her financial problems \nso that delinquent debt will not recur. Applicant's former husband did not meet his \nsupport obligations, but most of the debts arose after Applicant's divorce and were not \nincurred during the marriage. Even though Applicant has been continuously employed \nexcept for a short period since 1992, she has not been taken sufficient steps to keep \nahead of her debts. Applicant has not established that her financial problems were \nincurred under conditions beyond her control. As noted, she has been almost \ncontinuously employed since 1992, and most of the debts were incurred after her \ndivorce. She paid some of the smaller debts, but has not addressed many of the larger \ndebts. She is also still trying to determine the nature of some of the debts and the \nresponsible creditor. She has not demonstrated responsibly actions under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nGood-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by \npayment of debt only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant \nestablished that she paid some of her smallest debts. But, she still has not made any \nattempts to pay the largest debts. She only recently sent letters to creditors asking them \nto verify the amounts of the debts. Since the letters were only sent recently, she has not \nreceived return information from the creditors. She does not have payment plans \n\n \n8 \n \n \nestablished for the majority of her delinquent debts. She has not shown a systematic \nconcrete method of managing her delinquent finances. She has not shown reasonable \nand prudent courses of action to manage her debts. Accordingly, she has not \nestablished a good faith effort to resolve her debts. Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns based on her finances. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's good \nreputation at work and in the community for trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment. I considered that she is a single mother trying to raise a teen age daughter.  \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. She is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All \nthat is required is that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems and takes \nsignificant action to implement that plan. The entirety of her financial situation and her \nactions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which her plan to \nreduce her outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable \ninformation about the person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of debt payment. While \nApplicant established that she paid twelve of her smaller medical debts, she still has \nmajor delinquent debts from student loans, commercial loans, credit cards, and \n\n \n9 \n \n \ntelephone service. She has not presented a concrete systematic plan for resolving her \ndebt problems. She has no payment plans in place, and no methods of saving to pay \ndebts. She has not established she has sufficient monthly income to meet her present \nobligations. Applicant's management of her finances and her past obligations indicates \nshe will not be concerned, responsible, and careful regarding classified information. \nApplicant is financially overextended. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She has \nnot established she is suitable for a security clearance. I conclude Appellant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from her financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate of 1.f) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate of 1.h) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant (Duplicate of 1.b) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j - 1.n: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p - 1.u:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.x - 1.dd:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2007. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 2000. He was attending college when he submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in August 2007. He worked as a student assistant for the university he was attending while on educational leave from the defense contractor. He has never been married and has no children.1 The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts, totaling $57,877. Applicant admitted to owing all the debts. There is no evidence of payments on any of the debts. There is little information in the record as to the cause of Applicant\u2019s financial problems. His SF 86 indicates he attended college for much of the time since he earned his degree in 2000. There were brief periods of unemployment. Much of his work was related to the university and he was likely not well-paid. His credit reports also indicate a number of student loans.2 Applicant submitted documentation in response to DOHA interrogatories that he inquired with a credit counseling service in June 2008 about using their services. The company developed a proposed consolidation plan to pay $37,106 in debts to eight creditors, with an estimated monthly payment of $947.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 18, 2008, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on September 12, 2008. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nDecember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on September 24, 2008. As of \nDecember 12, 2008, he had not responded. I received the case assignment on \nDecember 12, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since August 2007. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in 2000. \nHe was attending college when he submitted his Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) in August 2007. He worked as a student assistant for the university he \nwas attending while on educational leave from the defense contractor. He has never \nbeen married and has no children.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts, totaling $57,877. Applicant admitted to \nowing all the debts. There is no evidence of payments on any of the debts. There is little \ninformation in the record as to the cause of Applicant\u2019s financial problems. His SF 86 \nindicates he attended college for much of the time since he earned his degree in 2000. \nThere were brief periods of unemployment. Much of his work was related to the \nuniversity and he was likely not well-paid. His credit reports also indicate a number of \nstudent loans.2 \n \n \nApplicant submitted documentation in response to DOHA interrogatories that he \ninquired with a credit counseling service in June 2008 about using their services. The \ncompany developed a proposed consolidation plan to pay $37,106 in debts to eight \ncreditors, with an estimated monthly payment of $947. Applicant did not submit \nadditional evidence as to whether he actually contracted with the company or made any \npayments to his creditors through the plan.3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n                                                          \n1 Items 4, 6. \n \n2 Items 2, 4-7. \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n4 \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments on any of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not applicable. He provided no explanation as to how he arrived at his current \nfinancial situation. It appears to be related to his student status, unemployment, and \nlow-paying university jobs. These could be conditions that were largely beyond his \ncontrol. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant did not explain all his debts or what if \nany affect these conditions had on his finances. He consulted with a credit counseling \ncompany in June 2008, but there is no evidence that he ever contracted with the \n\n \n5 \n \ncompany or made any payments on the proposed plan. There is insufficient information \nfor a finding that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \napplicable.   \n \nThe credit counseling company provides financial counseling, but there is no \nevidence that Applicant availed himself of that counseling. There are not clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not \napplicable. He has not made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. He did not dispute owing any of the debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has more than $55,000 in \ndelinquent debt. He provided no explanation for his financial problems. He has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his substantial delinquent debt. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 9, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire For Investigations Processing\non July 17, 2007.  On July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 12, 2008, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on September 25, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 30,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented four exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 4.  The Applicant\npresented six exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F, and testified on\nher own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on November 26, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\n\n2\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Taiwan.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 26).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 31 years of age and has a Bachelors of\nScience Degree in Electrical Engineering.  She is employed as a Systems Engineer for\na defense contractor.  She seeks a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1977.  She speaks Taiwanese and\nMandarin.  She is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States.  In 1984, she moved\nto the United States with her parents when she was seven years old.  She became a\nnaturalized United States citizen in 2001, at the age of twenty-four.  At that time, she\ndestroyed her Taiwanese passport.  She was offered a job with her present employer in\n2003, after working as an intern for a  year while in college.                 \nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s parents and a sister are dual citizens of Taiwan and the\nUnited States, they reside in the United States and have no intent of ever returning to\nTaiwan.  Her parents and sister have no contact with any of their family in Taiwan\nexcept the Applicant\u2019s grandmother, to check on her heath.  Applicant\u2019s parents own a\nhouse in the United States several miles from the Applicant\u2019s house and they live\nbetween both houses.  Since the Applicant works long hours, they clean, cook and do\nlaundry for her.  (Tr. p. 53).  \nThe Applicant\u2019s maternal grandparents are citizens and residents of Taiwan.\nThey are both retired.  The Applicant is not aware of their occupations before\nretirement.  She also has nine uncles and aunts, twenty-nine cousins who are citizens\nand residents of Taiwan.  She has a total of four nephews and nieces.  The Applicant\nhas no contact with any of her family in Taiwan.     \nShe traveled to Taiwan for her cousin\u2019s wedding in 2005.  Her only contact with\nher family in Taiwan since then was when a cousin and a niece came to visit in July or\nAugust 2008.\n      \nThe Applicant has no assets in Taiwan.  She and her sister own a house in the\nUnited States.  Applicant\u2019s net worth in the United States in approximately $600,000.00\n\n3\nincluding her house, a checking and savings account and a retirement account.\nApplicant\u2019s financial records substantiate this information.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, C\nand D and Tr. p. 48).   \nApplicant provided a copy of the International Travelers Guide (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E) and testified that if  if she is ever contacted or approached by anyone seeking\nclassified, sensitive or protected information she will report it to the Embassy and to her\ncompany.  (Tr. p. 49).                                                                                                         \n         \n          Two witnesses, including her current Manager and Project Lead, testified on\nbehalf of the Applicant.  They both consider her to be to be trustworthy, responsible,\npunctual and intelligent.  She is in the top 1/3 of the Engineers in the department.  Since\nworking for the company she has received a promotion for her excellent work.  (See Tr.\npp. 58-65)   \n  \nLetters of recommendation from her previous Manager and current Project Lead\nattest to her valuable engineering skills, professional attitude, intelligence and hard\nwork.  She is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Taiwan.  Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one of the most\nactive collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.  Numerous\nindividuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and or prosecuted for\nillegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United States technology to\nTaiwan.  One United States official was recently convicted of crimes relating to his\nimproper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\n\n4\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\n\n5\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence and has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\n\n6\nMitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S, and 8(c) Contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s has many family members in Taiwan who are residents\nand citizens of Taiwan, the Applicant is not close to any of them, and except for her\ngrandmother on rare occasions, she has no contact with them.  There is no evidence of\na close bond or strong evidence of affection.  The Applicant\u2019s deep and abiding ties are\nhere in the United States.  She has grown up and lived in the United States since she\nwas seven years old.  She has worked hard to establish herself as a responsible,\neducated, productive United States citizen.  Her employment with the DOD and her\nassets, that include her home, checking and saving account and retirement account are\nall in the United States.  The Applicant essentially cut all ties from Taiwan when she\nmoved to the United States at the age of seven and made it her permanent home.  \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Taiwan elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond and\naffection with her foreign family members or to any foreign individual or to Taiwan in any\nway that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, there is no possibility of\nforeign influence that exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.e.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.f.:  For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.g.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.h.: For the Applicant\n\n7\nSubpara.\n1.i.:  For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on October 28, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November\n18, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 10, 2008. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE 1-5), which were received into the record without\nobjection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE A-F), without\nobjection. I held the record open until January 9, 2009 and Applicant timely submitted a\nJanuary 21, 2009\n\n2\ndocument marked as AE G. Department Counsel had no objection and the document\nwas received into the record. DOHA received the transcript on December 18, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 6, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n. He provided additional information to support his\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in May 2000. In May 2003, he received a degree in electronic engineering.\nHe has been employed with his current employer since August 2008 (GE 1).\nIn 2004, Applicant had some delinquent debt as a result of \u201cmistakes that he\nmade with his credit\u201d (GE 4). He trusted his family and friends with his credit but they\ndefaulted on payments to the accounts in his name. He obtained a loan consolidation in\nthe amount of $3,000 to help pay that debt. He is still paying on the loan (Tr. 38). He\nbelieves the balance is $1,900.\nApplicant worked full time after high school. He worked steadily until March 2007\nwhen he was laid off from his job. At that time his hourly salary was $17 an hour. He\nwas unemployed for two weeks (Tr. 63). He took temporary jobs that ranged in pay from\n$11 to $12 an hour. Applicant could not maintain his expenses and accumulated\ndelinquent debt (Tr. 14).\nIn March 2006, Applicant purchased a truck for his parents.

He tried to settle with the company in\n2006 but he did not have a sufficient lump sum (Tr. 32). \nApplicant is single but plans to wed next year (Tr. 16). He stated he will need\nmoney to pay for the wedding. He has a two-year-old daughter from a long term\nrelationship that ended in 2008. He pays child support in the amount of $500 a month to\nher mother (AE B). A garnishment of $40 a month from his paycheck is for insurance for\nhis daughter (GE 4).\nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts/collection accounts. The total amount of\nthe delinquent debt is approximately $19,647.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a collection account in the amount of $958 for a cell phone.

He promised to pay a few more\ndebts in the weeks after the hearing but he did not submit any documentation to support\nthis assertion.\nApplicant\u2019s annual performance appraisals rate him as \u201cfully meeting\nrequirements\u201d with \u201cexceeds requirements\u201d in several areas. He displays an ability to\nhandle a large workload while adhering closely to policies and procedures (AE G). He\ndisplays a positive attitude at work.\nApplicant\u2019s interpersonal and communication skills include excellent listening and\ntroubleshooting skills.

His supervisor recommends him for a security clearance (AE G).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s colleagues and friends attest to his reliability, maturity and high level\nof dedication to his work. He has received various awards in recognition of his\nachievements. He is a loyal and trusted friend who is respectful and conscientious.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts ($19,647) and could not\nmeet his financial obligations from 2003 until the present. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries are partially the result of allowing his credit to be used by\nfamily and friends who defaulted on paying their bills. However his delinquent debts\nhave various sources and have been ongoing. This potentially mitigating condition does\nnot apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems may have increased with a short period of unemployment and lower\nwage rate, but Applicant did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving his debts.\nHe did not take an active stance when he learned about many of them. Applicant has\nworked steadily for many years with a few periods of unemployment, I find this\npotentially mitigating condition does not apply.\n\n6\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This does not apply. Applicant has no budget\nand has had no financial counseling. He is paying child support insurance through a\ngarnishment. He does not have a handle on his financial affairs at this time. He plans to\npay his delinquent debt but has no firm plan in place at this time.\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant initially\nobtained a loan consolidation plan to repay earlier debt in 2004. Since then he has not\nattempted to resolve his financial issues. He paid several small debts but the majority\nare unresolved. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that the alleged\ndebts were due to his parents and friends not paying on the accounts that Applicant\nallowed them to use. He acknowledged that he signed for the accounts and is\nresponsible for them. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that under the whole\nperson, there is not sufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant has worked for a number of years since receiving his degree. He has a\nvery good work record and a recommendation from his supervisor. He is a valuable and\ntrusted employee. He received good evaluations. His friends and colleagues attest to\nhis loyalty, responsibility, and dedication. He has a two-year-old-daughter that he\nsupports. He helped his parents and friends when they needed credit. However, that\n\n7\nexacerbated his financial difficulties. The largest debt is the purchase of the truck for his\nparents. He acknowledges that he is the signer on the loan and is responsible for the\ndebt.\nApplicant promises to pay his delinquent debts soon. His parents are providing\n$400 a month toward that plan. However, Applicant has not yet established a payment\nplan. He paid several small debts but the majority of his delinquent debt is unpaid. He\nhas not provided sufficient mitigation to sustain his burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On December 31, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding the three allegations brought under Guideline E.  Those\n1\nfavorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August\n4, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.  \n1\nThe Judge found, inter alia, that Applicant had a 29-year history of alcohol abuse and\ncriminal conduct that included at least six arrests and convictions for DWI.  The Judge also found\nthat while his most recent arrest was more than six years old, Applicant continues to drink alcohol,\nwhich has been at the root of his criminal problems.  She found that Applicant has tried on numerous\noccasions to abstain from the use of alcohol, but has always returned to it.  Also, the Judge found\nthat, while his recent alcohol assessment did not diagnose him with alcohol dependence, Applicant\u2019s\noverall history of alcohol abuse clearly demonstrates that he has had a serious problem.  The Judge\nconcluded that, given his continued consumption of alcohol after numerous program\nrecommendations that he abstain from the use of alcohol, it is not clear from his past record that\nApplicant will not return to his old ways.  The Judge concluded that the various mitigating\nconditions listed under Guidelines G and J were not applicable.\nApplicant argues that his alcohol abuse is in full remission and that the record indicates that\nhe has provided adequate evidence of mitigation.  He stresses the passage of over six years and\npositive changes in his lifestyle.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not demonstrate error on the part of the\nJudge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  The Judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to mitigate the\nlengthy history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-related incidents with the police, given Applicant\u2019s\ndecision to continue to consume alcohol.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the record.\n\n3\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

(Government Exhibit 1).  On December 31, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guidelines G, J and E for Applicant. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel; Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 8, 2009.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing on January 27, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on\nMarch 5, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 8, 2009, and the matter was\nscheduled for hearing on May 20, 2009.  The Applicant did not appear at the hearing\ndue to a failure to receive notice of the hearing.  A continuance was granted.  The case\nwas assigned to the undersigned Administrative Judge on May 26, 2009.  A notice of\nhearing was issued on June 2, 2009, and the matter was scheduled for June 24, 2009.\nAt the hearing, the Government presented four exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. The Applicant called one\n\n2\nwitness and presented nine exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I,\nwhich were received without objection. The Applicant also testified on his own behalf.\nThe record remained open until July 8, 2009, to allow the Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing exhibit, consisting of eight\nenclosures that was admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on July 2, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 49 years old.  He has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Material\nLogistics Management.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Software\nEngineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant began consuming alcohol in 1980, at the young age of eighteen\nwhile attending his first year of college.  At first, he drank socially.  As time passed, his\ncircle of friends were heavy drinkers, and his desire to fit in caused him to drink\nexcessively and engage in criminal conduct.  On many occasions, over the past twenty-\nnine years, he has driven a vehicle while intoxicated and was not arrested.  On six\nseparate occasions, he was arrested and convicted for Driving Under the Influence\n(DIU).  Each of those arrests are discussed below.    \nIn March 1985, the Applicant had been drinking beer with friends at a bar.  While\ndriving home, he was pulled over by the police.  He was arrested and charged with DUI.\nHe pled guilty and was fined.  A year later, in April 1986, he was arrested again, and\ncharged with DUI.  Again, he had been drinking beer with friends at a bar.  He\nremembers consuming between two and four beers before driving.  This time, he was\ndriving to the airport when he was pulled over by police.  He pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a fine and community service.  Two months later, in June 1986, he was\narrested and charged with DUI.  He pled guilty and was sentenced to an Educational\nAlcohol Awareness class and was fined.  Four years later, in March 2000, he was\ncharged with (1) DUI with Alcohol/Drugs and (2) DUI with .08 or More.  The Applicant\nexplained that he had attended his fathers birthday party where he drank too many\nbeers.  As he was driving home, he was attempting to stop at a stop sign when he\nbumped a car.  He pled Nolo Contendere to Count (2) and was sentenced to five years\nprobation, 180 days confinement, suspended, a first offender special alcohol program,\nand a fine.  (Government Exhibits 3(b) and 4).  \n\n3\nAt this point, the Applicant did not believe that he was alcohol dependent or that\nhis drinking was abusive.  He just thought that he was unlucky.  Although he stopped\ndrinking alcohol for several months following this arrest, he  eventually started drinking\nagain.  (Tr. p. 67-68).  Three years later in May 2003, the Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with (1) DUI with Alcohol/Drugs and (2) DUI with .08 or More.  The Applicant\nexplained that he had been at a bar consuming alcohol with a friend.  On his way home,\nhe did not have his car lights on and was pulled over by the police.  He pled No Contest\nto Count (2) and was sentenced to 365 days confinement, 361 days suspended, five\nyears probation, a fine, and an alcohol counseling program for a year. \nIn July 2003, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Lewd Act to a\nChild, (2) Indecent Exposure, (3) Giving False Information to a Peace Officer (4) Cruelty\nto a Child by Endangering Heath, and (5) DUI with Alcohol/Drugs, Prior DUI within 7\nyears.  The Applicant explained that he had been consuming alcohol for much of the\nday and was intoxicated when he walked into a public restroom that is known for\n\u201ccruising\u201d.  (Tr. p. 27).  In the restroom, he patted a minor on the buttocks.  He then\ndrove home.  Sometime later, the police arrived at his home to arrest him.  (Tr. p. 73).\nThe Applicant pled guilty to Counts (4) and (5).  He was sentenced to five years\nprobation, 120 days confinement, Substance Abuse Assessment, Multiple Conviction\nProgram and a fine.  Counts (1), (2) and (3) were dismissed.  (Government Exhibits 3(a)\nand 4, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nAt this point, the Applicant realized that he had to do something about his\nexcessive drinking and driving.  He attended Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings for\neighteen months and completely abstained from alcohol during this period.  (Tr. p. 85).\nHe testified that he found the counseling to be helpful but eventually went back to\nconsuming alcohol in 2005.  (Tr. p. 92).  He contends that he has not been intoxicated\nsince his last arrest.   \nThe Applicant completed each of the sentences imposed by the court as a result\nof each conviction.  Each time, he attended some type of alcohol awareness or alcohol\ncounseling program.  (Tr. p. 90).  Despite this, he still continues to consume alcohol.\nHe testified that he enjoys drinking with friends about once or twice a month and has a\nglass of wine with dinner on occasion.  He indicates that he no longer drinks to the point\nof intoxication.  (Tr. p. 54).  He states that he has severed his friendship with his heavy\ndrinking friends, and now regularly associates with tennis players, who do not partake in\nthe habit.    \nOn June 19, 2009, the Applicant sought out and obtained an alcohol and drug\nevaluation.  The results of the report indicate that the Applicant does not meet the\ndiagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence.  It states,  \nHis typical drinking pattern prior to 2003 was to drink 1 or 2 times a week\non weekends.  When he did drink, he typically drank more than four drinks\nper occasion.  Since 2003, he has not had any further problems with\nalcohol.  He has changed his social network so he no longer socializes\nwith heavy drinkers.  In the previous 12 months he reports no alcohol\nbinges, where a binge is defines as more than 4 drinks on one occasion.\nHe also reports that he normally drinks per occasion about four times per\n\n4\nweek which is within the not-at-risk limits recommended by the National\nInstitute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).  He also reports that\nthis has been his typical drinking pattern since his last DUI in 2003....\nBased on the clinical interview and testing, Mr. Pilarski meets the lifetime\ncriteria for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse but not for alcohol dependence.\nSince his drinking has been non-problematic for more than 5 years, his\ncurrent diagnosis is alcohol abuse in sustained full remission. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Government alleges that during an interview with a DoD contract investigator\non January 31, 2008, the Applicant deliberately omitted material facts and revealed only\nthat he was arrested for a Lewd and Lascivious act with a minor in July 2003, and was\noffered to pled guilty to a DUI instead.  He did not reveal that he was charged with\nCruelty to a Child by Endangering Health.        \nThe Government also alleges that when the Applicant completed his\nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions dated November 27, 2007, he deliberately\nfalsified material facts.  In response to Question 23 which asks whether the Applicant\nhas ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offenses, the Applicant\nresponded that \u201ca L and L act charge in July 2003 was dropped\u201d.  He did not disclose\nthat he pled guilty to a Cruelty to a Child by Endangering Health charge.    \nIt is not credible to believe that the Applicant deliberately omitted the lesser\ncharge of Cruelty to a Child by Endangering Health, a misdemeanor, when he revealed\nthe more serious felony charge of Lewd and Lascivious act with a minor that was\ndropped.  Clearly he did not deliberately attempt to conceal any material information\nfrom the Government concerning the arrest during his interview with the DoD\ninvestigator or in his responses on the security clearance application.  Accordingly,\nGuideline E is found for the Applicant.\nMitigation.\nA long time neighbor and friend of the Applicant testified that he considers the\nApplicant to be upright and honest.  The witness has seen a dramatic change in the\nApplicant.  Specifically, a change in his circle of friends and that he does not consume\nalcohol as much as he used to.  The Applicant now plays tennis, works out at the gym\nand bikes.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G and H).    \nA letter of recommendation from the Section Vice President of the company\nindicates that the Applicant is regarded as a key team member by the client.  He is\nconsidered reliable and stable and his work ethic and job performance have been\noutstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\n\n5\nCharacter references from coworkers, friends and neighbors of the Applicant\nconsider him responsible, honest and trustworthy and completely deserving of a\nsecurity clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).  \nPerformance appraisals of the Applicant for the rating periods from May 2000\nthrough March 30, 2007, reflect that his work performance consistently either \u201cfar\nexceeds\u201d or \u201cexceeds most\u201d in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\n\n6\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The extent to which the participation is voluntary\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\n\n7\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse, criminal conduct and/or dishonesty that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G), dishonesty (Guideline E), and\nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the\nApplicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security\nclearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines G and J of the SOR.\nThe Applicant\u2019s twenty-nine year history of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct\nincludes at least six arrests and convictions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.\nAlthough his most recent arrest occurred in 2003, over six years ago, he continues to\nconsume alcohol, which has been at the root of his criminal problems.  He has tried on\nnumerous occasions to abstain from the use of alcohol, but has always returned to\nusing it.  Although his recent alcohol assessment does not diagnose him with alcohol\n\n8\ndependence, his past history of alcohol abuse clearly demonstrates that there has been\na serious problem.  \nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 22(c)\nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent and,\n22(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence apply.  None of\nthe mitigating conditions are applicable.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  \nDespite participating in a number of alcohol awareness programs, regular AA\nmeetings, and their recommendation that he completely abstain from the use of alcohol,\nthe Applicant continues to consume alcohol.  It is not clear from his past record that he\nwill not again return to his old ways.  Based upon his long history of alcohol abuse and\ncriminal conduct, its related negative effects on the Applicant are such that I am unable\nto find him sufficiently trustworthy to safeguard classified information.  Accordingly\nGuidelines G and J are found against the Applicant. \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, I do not find that the Applicant deliberately\nomitted, concealed or falsified any material facts during his interview with the DoD\ninvestigator or on his security clearance application.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder this guideline. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is a 49 year old, intelligent,\nsuccessful, well respected, and a long time employee of the defense industry.  Under\nthe particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth above when viewed\nunder all of the guidelines as a whole, support a whole person assessment of poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of his excessive alcohol abuse and his criminal\nconduct and the effects that it can have on his ability to safeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\n\n9\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  Paragraph 3 is found for the\nApplicant.\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Those\n1\nfavorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.  \n1\nThe Judge found, inter alia, that Applicant had a 29-year history of alcohol abuse and\ncriminal conduct that included at least six arrests and convictions for DWI.  The Judge also found\nthat while his most recent arrest was more than six years old, Applicant continues to drink alcohol,\nwhich has been at the root of his criminal problems.  She found that Applicant has tried on numerous\noccasions to abstain from the use of alcohol, but has always returned to it.  Also, the Judge found\nthat, while his recent alcohol assessment did not diagnose him with alcohol dependence, Applicant\u2019s\noverall history of alcohol abuse clearly demonstrates that he has had a serious problem.  The Judge\nconcluded that, given his continued consumption of alcohol after numerous program\nrecommendations that he abstain from the use of alcohol, it is not clear from his past record that\nApplicant will not return to his old ways.  The Judge concluded that the various mitigating\nconditions listed under Guidelines G and J were not applicable.\nApplicant argues that his alcohol abuse is in full remission and that the record indicates that\nhe has provided adequate evidence of mitigation.  He stresses the passage of over six years and\npositive changes in his lifestyle.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not demonstrate error on the part of the\nJudge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  The Judge concluded that there was insufficient evidence to mitigate the\nlengthy history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-related incidents with the police, given Applicant\u2019s\ndecision to continue to consume alcohol.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the record.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\n\n3\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about April 2, 2009, and requested a hearing.  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on April 30, 2009, and issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJuly 23, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nMay 11, 2009. The case was heard on June 11, 2009, as scheduled.  Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called one witness and offered Exhibits (AE) A through M into \nevidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until \nJune 24, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On \nJune 16, 2009, Applicant submitted an exhibit that I marked as AE N and admitted into \nthe record without objection by the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on June 29, 2009.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the three allegations contained in Paragraph 1 of the SOR \nunder Guideline E. \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old, married and has two children. In February 2000, he \nenlisted in the U. S. Air Force. He was honorably discharged in December 2004 as a \nstaff sergeant (E-5). While in the Air Force, he held a Top Secret security clearance and \nhad access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) beginning in 2002. \n \n  \nPrior to leaving the Air Force, Applicant started his own practice as a licensed \nmassage therapist in October 2004. In April 2005, he began a full-time position as a \ncommunications technician with a defense contractor. He continued to practice \nmassage therapy until December 2005 when his license lapsed. (GE 1) \n \n \nIn early 2005, a massage therapist working with Applicant offered him a \nmarijuana cigarette. Applicant \u201ctook three puffs on the marijuana joint and then gave\u201d it \nback to the other therapist. (Tr. 26) That was the first time he tried marijuana. He \nacknowledged that it was an impulsive act, one that he regretted afterward. (Tr. 42) He \nhas not smoked marijuana since that day. (Tr. 41) He admitted that he held a security \nclearance at the time, having been discharged from the Air Force at the end of \nDecember 2004. (Id.) He told his wife after the incident. (Tr. 42) He was 24 years old at \nthe time.1 \n \n \nIn November 1, 2006, Applicant submitted an e-QIP. In response to \u201cSection 24: \nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity a. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, \nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.) amphetamines, depressants,(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc0, hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc), or prescription drugs.\u201d he answered \u201cno.\u201d2 \n \n \nIn response to Section 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity b. Have \nyou ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement \n                                            \n1The Government has not alleged security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  \n2The November 2006 e-QIP was the second security clearance Applicant completed. He \npreviously submitted one when he entered the Air Force. (Tr. 33)  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nofficer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance, or while \nin a position directly or immediately affecting public,\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d  \n \nWhen he completed the e-QIP, Applicant knew he had tried marijuana on one \noccasion in early 2005, but interpreted the word \u201cuse\u201d in the two questions to imply a \npattern of illegal abuse. He did not consider his one time experimentation as falling \nwithin the parameters of the questions. He did not intend to deceive or withhold \ninformation from the Government. (Tr. 29, 37) In April 2007, Applicant was interviewed \nby a Government investigator. During that interview, the investigator asked him whether \nhe had ever \u201ctried\u201d any kind of illegal drug. He answered \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed the early \n2005 incident. (Tr. 29) The Government did not have independent evidence of the 2005 \nincident until this disclosure. \n \n \nWhile in the Air Force, Applicant was aware of the Government\u2019s zero tolerance \npolicy on drug abuse and its random drug screening practices. (Tr. 33-34) He also knew \nthat if he had been in the Air Force at the time he smoked the marijuana cigarette and \ntested positive for illegal substances, he would have been disciplined. (Tr. 35) He \nadmitted that he used poor judgment when he accepted the marijuana cigarette. (Tr. 38) \n \n \nApplicant no longer associates with the therapist. He has no intention of using \ndrugs illegally. He signed a Statement of Intent never to use any illegal substance \nagain. (AE I)  He submitted a June 11, 2009 random drug test that documents negative \nresults. (AE N) His family and employer are aware of the incident and this proceeding. \n(Tr. 43) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s step-brother testified. He is a business intelligence architect. He has \nheld a Top Secret security clearance for two and a half years while in the U.S. Navy. He \nis aware of the facts underlying this proceeding. He does not believe Applicant uses \ncontrolled substances and has no reservations about Applicant possessing a security \nclearance. (Tr. 18-22) \n \n \nApplicant \nsubmitted \neight \nletters \nof \nrecommendation. \nThe \noperations \nnoncommissioned officer (NCO) at the facility where Applicant worked in October 2001 \nas an airman wrote that he had no knowledge of any incidents regarding Applicant, \nwhich \u201cwould infringe on my trust in him to have this level of access or to be trusted in \nan environment where he would work alone with sensitive or critical communication \nsystems with far-reaching impact to National Defense.\u201d (AE A) A former airman, who \nserved with Applicant and maintains a Top Secret/SCI level clearance, is familiar with \nthe allegations of the SOR. He wrote, \u201cI have never know him to exercise poor judgment \nin either his personal or professional life, and at no point have I ever thought that this \nindividual could be seen as a risk to the US government while serving as a cleared \nemployee or contractor.\u201d (AE B) Applicant\u2019s co-worker and mentor for four years stated, \n\u201cNever have I known or suspected [Applicant] of being deceitful in any circumstance or \ncapacity.\u201d (AE C) The remaining five letters attest to Applicant\u2019s good character. (AE D, \nE, F, G, H) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nOn April 29 and 30, 2009, Applicant voluntarily underwent a psychological \nassessment for substance abuse. The evaluating psychologist found that \u201cApplicant \ndoes not meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder . . .  He does not meet \ndiagnostic criteria for a personality disorder.\u201d (AE J at 5) The psychologist noted that \nApplicant \u201cadmitted to a single episode of usage of cannabis.\u201d (Id.) The psychologist did \nnot recommend any form of mental health or substance abuse treatment. (Id.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concerns pertaining to the Personal Conduct guideline are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant used marijuana while \nholding a security clearance in 2005. It alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c that he falsified \nanswers to two questions on his e-QIP because he failed to disclose his one-time use.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The Government contended that two conditions may apply in this case:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, support a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability. \n \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgement that he held a security clearance in early 2005 \nwhen he tried marijuana is sufficient to raise a potential disqualification under AG \u00b6 \n16(c). His illegal one-time use of marijuana is not sufficient to raise security concerns \nunder the guideline for drug involvement, but does support a finding of questionable \njudgment under this guideline, given his previous service in the Air Force and \nknowledge of its drug policy.   \nApplicant denied that he intentionally omitted information in the e-QIP about the \nmarijuana incident.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, as in this case, the \nGovernment has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does \nnot establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred.  An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, \n2004)). \n \nBased on the record evidence, which includes Applicant\u2019s four years of Air Force \nservice, knowledge of the military\u2019s position on drug abuse, his previous experience with \nthe security clearance process, his articulate and intelligent demeanor, and the fact that \nhe was 26-years old when he completed the e-QIP, I do not find his explanation for \nfailing to disclose the marijuana incident credible, but rather a deliberate concealment \nunder AG \u00b6 16 (a).  \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the resulting \nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 17 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising under this guideline: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAs to the allegation contained in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant tried marijuana in early \n2005 while holding a security clearance, approximately four years ago, and under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur because he no longer works as a massage \ntherapist or with the massage therapist who provided the marijuana. He admitted his \nwrongful conduct and the consequences of it and has no intention to use illegal \nsubstances again. Hence, AG \u00b6 17(c) and AG \u00b6 17(g) have some application as to the \ndisqualification raised under AG \u00b6 16(c). Applicant immediately told his wife about the \nincident in 2005, and subsequently told his family and current employer. Those \ndisclosures constitute some evidence of positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to duress and warrant a limited application of AG \u00b6 17(e).   \n \nAs to the disqualification raised under AG \u00b6 16(a), pertinent to the falsification \nallegations, AG \u00b6 17(a) and AG \u00b6 17(b) have limited application. When interviewed \nabout his e-QIP answers, Applicant voluntarily offered information about his one-time \nexperimentation with marijuana and cooperated fully. His honest disclosure \nsubsequently served as the basis for this case.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 28-year-old man, who \nhonorably served in the U.S. Air Force for four years, during which time he held a \nTS/SCI level security clearance. His former NCO and other servicemen consider him \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nreliable and trustworthy based on their interaction with him while in the Air Force. His \ncurrent mentor of four years finds him to be honest. He voluntarily underwent a \npsychological assessment in April 2009 that concluded he does not meet diagnostic \ncriteria for substance abuse or a personality disorder that could raise concerns about \nhis current or future reliability or judgment. He eliminated the potential for coercion \nthrough his disclosures of his marijuana use. As a consequence of this investigation and \nhearing, he is fully aware of his mistakes in smoking marijuana and failing to disclosing \nit, further reducing the likelihood of similar misconduct. I also recognize that his \nvoluntarily and candid disclosure of the marijuana incident during an interview, which \ngenerated this proceeding, warrants consideration under this section.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 30, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\nSee Tr. at 91: \u201cQ: . . . Are you current on your state and federal taxes right now? . . . A: No.  Q: You\u2019re not?\n1\nA: No . . . Q: How much do you owe [to State]: A: I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t filed them in years . . . Q: What about federal\ntaxes?

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 16, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nsupported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge was biased against Applicant; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFinding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 65 year-old systems\nengineer for a Defense contractor.  He has had two prior wives.  He has three children by the second\nof the two, and he went through \u201can acrimonious divorce\u201d with her.  Decision at 2.\nOf the nine debts listed in the SOR, the Judge found against Applicant only as to one of them,\na $62,567 child/family support order by a court, arising from the above-referenced divorce from his\nsecond wife.  Applicant provided several explanations for this debt: (1) that the court order misstated\nhis income, resulting in erroneous payment calculations; (2) that the district attorney was prejudiced\nagainst him and that lawyers in the DA office falsified the court order; (3) that his second wife is the\nhead of a crime family and put pressure on the DA to get more money from Applicant; and (4) that\nApplicant should not have to pay the debt because he is 65 years old.  The Judge also found that\nApplicant is not current on his state and federal income taxes.  Applicant stated that he has not paid\nhis taxes because he does not want any refund to go to his ex-wife in satisfaction of the child support\norder.  In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge concluded, inter alia, that Applicant had\nfailed to demonstrate responsible behavior in regard to his child support debt.   Neither did Applicant\nprovide  a reasonable basis to question the validity of this debt.   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant claims that the Judge erred in finding that he had not filed tax returns in\nrecent years.  However, a review of the record supports the Judge\u2019s findings.   Considering the record\n1\nevidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  Concerning Applicant\u2019s claim that the Judge\nlacked the requisite impartiality, there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and\nunbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See,\ne. g., ISCR Case No. 07- 02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App.\nBd. May 14, 2004).  Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and\n\n3\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant points to his having held a security clearance for around 40\nyears without incident or concern.  However, prior decisions to grant or retain a clearance do not\nundermine the legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s subsequent adverse decision.  \u201cThe government is not\nestopped from making an adverse clearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 07-17383 at 2 (App. Bd.

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn December 17, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 24, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non October 1, 2008, and I received the case assignment on December 15, 2008. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on January 12, 2009, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on January 28, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through G, \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 6, \n2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 10, 2009, to \nsubmit additional matters. On February 10, 2009, he submitted two large sets of \ndocuments without objection. I marked them as Exhibit H, which included a diverse \ncollection of documents, and Exhibit I, which consisted of at least 193 pages of \ndocuments pertaining to Applicant\u2019s divorce from his former second wife. The record \nclosed on February 10, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d to 1.f, 1.h to 1.j of the SOR, with explanations. He \ndenied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.g of the SOR. He also provided \nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 65 years old, currently married to his third wife, and employed by a \ndefense contractor as a systems engineer.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. \nHe has one son by his first wife, three children by his second wife, and no children by \nhis third wife.  Applicant has had a security clearance for about 40 years with no \nnegative incidents.  He went through an acrimonious divorce from his second wife. (Tr. \n12, 32, 33, 38, 46, 49-51, 116; Exhibits 1, F) \n \n \nApplicant has nine delinquent debts listed in the SOR totaling about $65,000.  \nEight of the nine debts are less than $1,000 each.  The ninth debt is $62,567 for child or \nfamily support ordered to be paid by a court order in Applicant\u2019s divorce.  The divorce \nfrom his second wife was final in 2004. He contends the acrimonious divorce \ncontributed to his financial delinquencies because he had to spend money on legal \nrepresentation and an appeal to reduce the child support ordered.  Applicant accused \nhis former wife of various criminal activities involving illegal immigration and fraud. \nApplicant also asserts that his unemployment from 2001 to 2002 for about 12 months \nrestricted his ability to pay his delinquent debts.  His final reason for not paying his \ndebts was his illness in 2006.  He claims food poisoning and continued problems \nresulting from that poisoning added medical bills not covered by insurance to his list of \ndelinquent debts.  Applicant also lived in hotels and corporate apartments, paying \n$3,000 to $4,000 monthly.  He now rents a home for himself, his wife, and daughter for \n$850 monthly.  He claims that these living expenses, including eating in restaurants a \ngreat many times each month, prevented him from having enough money to pay his \ndelinquent debts. Applicant now earns $2,000 weekly on his employment contract. (Tr. \n11, 49, 55-58, 72, 78, 80-83, 89, 104; Exhibits 2-4, 6, A-D, G-I) \n \n \nThe eight smaller debts listed in the SOR Applicant paid over the past two years.  \nThey total $2,640. Most were paid after the June 2008 issuance of the SOR.  Applicant \nadmitted in Exhibit G that he purposely selected debts that would not be paid because \nhe had his three children to take care of and the child custody battle with his former wife \n\n \n3 \n \n \nto fight, needing his income for those matters more than for the payment of these debts. \nThe following information explains those debts and their repayment. \n \n1. The car payment debt of $439 (Subparagraph 1.c) was paid and the \naccount is current.  The car is a new 2008 model purchased by Applicant for his \n17-year-old daughter so she can drive herself to her private school.  Applicant \nhas been tardy in making those payments in the past, and caught up on them.  \nHis daughter lives with Applicant, and is enrolled in a private school with a $600 \nmonthly tuition.  His daughter also receives from Applicant $200 weekly for her \nexpenses.  He pays her car insurance premium.  Applicant paid his daughter\u2019s \nspeeding ticket and hired an attorney to represent her in 2008.  Applicant claims \nhis other children did not progress past junior year in high school, obtaining their \nhigh school equivalence diplomas later, and his $1,200 or more monthly \nexpenses for  his daughter are designed to keep her in school until she \ngraduates in May 2009. (Tr. 22-24, 37, 73, 85, 96-99; Exhibits 2-6, E (pps.2-5)) \n \n2. The medical debt of $335 (Subparagraph 1.d) was paid in September \n2008. (Tr. 24, 73; Exhibits 2-6, E (pps. 6-8)) \n \n3. The next debt is for medical services in the amount of $189 \n(Subparagraph 1.e).  It was paid January 22, 2009, after being delinquent since \n2007. (Tr. 24, 25, 73; Exhibits 2-6, E (p. 9)) \n \n4. Applicant paid a $27 debt for another medical procedure (Subparagraph \n1.f).  It was paid on September 23, 2008.  It was delinquent from 2007. (Tr. 25, \n73; Exhibits 2-6, E (pps. 10, 11)) \n \n5. There were several telephone company bills Applicant owed since \n2006.  He disputed some of them, but eventually paid all of them, including the \n$728 debt listed in Subparagraph 1.g.  This debt was paid in April 2008. (Tr. 26, \n27, 73; Exhibits 2-6, E (pps. 12-26)) \n \n6. Applicant paid a collection agency for his satellite television debt of \n$318 (Subparagraph 1.h) on January 20, 2009.  The debt became delinquent in \n2006. (Tr. 28, 73; Exhibits 2-6, E (pps. 27, 28)) \n \n7. Applicant paid a collection agency $196.66 on a $162 debt owed to a \nmedical provider who tested him for a sleeping disorder (Subparagraph 1. i).  The \ndebt became delinquent in 2007. This debt was paid on January 14, 2009. (Tr. \n29, 73; Exhibits 2-6, E (pps. 30, 31)) \n \n8. The final debt Applicant paid was for $442 to a medical provider \n(Subparagraph 1.j).  Applicant paid the debt on January 20, 2009. (Tr. 29, 73; \nExhibits 2-6, E (pps. 29-32)) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on September 23, 2004, seeking discharge \nof $204,666.24 in financial obligations.  He listed various debts, including attorneys\u2019 \nfees, private school tuition of $4,765 owed, and state income taxes for 1999 \n($1,180.38).  He filed because of the divorce expenses. For the debts which could be \ndischarged under the Federal Bankruptcy Law, Applicant was given a discharge on \nJanuary 3, 2005.  Applicant\u2019s income in 2006 was shown on his W2 Form as $43,712.  \nHis 2007 income tax return showed an income of $24,800. (Tr. 17, 60; Exhibits 1, 5, H) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s largest delinquent debt is the $62,567 in unpaid child support.  \nApplicant contends it is properly labeled family support, but regardless of the title, this \nmoney was ordered paid by valid state court judgments against Applicant between 2001 \nand 2004.  He was ordered to make payments to his former second wife.  In December \n2008, the state agency collecting the money listed $20,693.19 as interest, and \n$44,128.77 as the principal balance owed.  Applicant claims this debt is not valid \nbecause it is not one he incurred, nor did he have the income at the time periods the \ncourt order states he had on which the court based its payment calculations. He also \ncontends that he was the custodial parent when his former wife claimed she was, and \nthat he was owed child support as a result.  Applicant described the local district \nattorney as prejudiced against men and him in particular, and that the lawyers in that \noffice falsified the court order.  Next, Applicant asserts his former wife was the leader of \na \u201ccrime family,\u201d which put pressure on the district attorney to falsify the court order to \nget more money from him.  Finally, Applicant also claims that because he is 65 years \nold, he should not pay the debt. (Tr. 62, 68-72, 91, 92, 106, 107; Exhibits 2-4, 6, B, D, H \nand I) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he is not current on his state and federal income taxes.  He \nhas not filed state income taxes in the state from which he originally worked and lived \nfor many years.  He claims he is not a resident of the state in which he is currently \nworking, though he has been there since 2008.  He admitted he last filed a Federal \nincome tax return in 2005.  He does file income tax returns because any refund he \nwould receive would be seized by the state court for payment of his past due child \nsupport obligations.  Applicant contends that money would fund his former wife\u2019s \ncriminal activities, and he does not want the money used for that purpose.  Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent $2,000 weekly contractual income does not have tax withholding subtracted.  He \ndoes not escrow any money to pay his income taxes.  He has no savings or \ninvestments.  He has a small checking account. (Tr. 49, 91, 92, 103, 104, 131; Exhibits \n2-4, 6, G-I) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a character letter, and two letters about his contract from his \nemployer.  The employer has no complains about his work.  It is aware of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial, marital and health problems in the past.  The employer recommends Applicant \nretain his security clearance. (Exhibits F and H)  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable and unwilling \nto pay these obligations for the past five years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  An examination of the evidence as applied to \neach mitigating condition shows which ones might be applicable in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial debts arose \nbetween about 2001 and 2006. He accumulated some delinquent debt due to his \ncalculated decisions not to pay certain debts, and his contesting of the divorce child \nsupport payments.  His financial decisions led to his 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His \nincome for the past two years appears sufficient to have allowed him to pay the eight \nsmall debts sooner than he did, and his year-long unemployment in 2002 has not had \nany effect on his ability to pay his debts.  He continued to work while having some \nmedical issues several years ago, and they did not affect his ability to repay his debts. \nHis refusal to pay his income taxes and continued refusal to pay his court-ordered child \nsupport are extant and serious issues. Applicant\u2019s behavior did not occur under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, but in fact continues.  His decisions on \nhis taxes and child support obligations do raise concerns about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence does not raise this potentially \nmitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nthe financial problems arose from his acrimonious divorce, but the decision to contest \nthe divorce and object to paying child support, from the exhibits Applicant submitted, are \nclearly his own decisions.  He could have resolved these issues years ago, but \ncontinues to fight his former wife. He has not acted responsibly under these \ncircumstances, particularly in his willful refusal and failure to file any state income tax \nreturns and his Federal income tax return.  The only tax he pays now is the sales tax for \nany purchase he makes anywhere.  He is not paying his income taxes, while expecting \nto continue to receive an income from a federal contract funded by other persons\u2019 \nincome tax payments. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for \nconsideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c).  There is no evidence Applicant received \nfinancial counseling from any one.  In fact, he spends every dollar he earns, resulting in \nno savings or investments for his future.  He spends an excessive amount of money on \nhotel living accommodations while on his current job, eating in restaurants, and paying \nnearly $2,000 monthly to cajole his daughter into finishing high school.  All this money \ncould have been spent on the debts listed in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s financial decisions \ncaused his problems, and reflect adversely on his judgment.  His finances are not under \ncontrol. This potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for consideration. \n \n Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated \na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant \nresolved eight of the delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement, only after he \nrealized he could lose his security clearance if he failed to take any action. Despite that \nknowledge, he deliberately failed to take any action on his two largest financial \nproblems, his past-due child support and income taxes.  He is not financially sound and \nis unprepared for future contingencies. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition \nhas limited applicability to the eight debts Applicant paid. \n \nAG & 20 (e) requires \u201cthe individual to have a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  Applicant disputes his child support obligations.  He \nsubmitted voluminous documents to show the basis for his dispute.  However, this \nforum cannot retry the state court\u2019s determination that the child support is due and \nowing.  The state court\u2019s order is presumed valid and binding.  Applicant\u2019s accusations \nagainst his former wife of criminal actions and his claims of bias by the state \nprosecutorial agencies cannot be adjudicated in a security clearance proceeding.  I read \nthe documents submitted by Applicant, and am not persuaded that he has no basis \nupon which to pay his financial obligations and his income taxes.  I conclude this \npotentially mitigating condition has no applicability in Applicant\u2019s case here. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFinally, AG \u00b6 20 (f), requiring \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source of \nincome,\u201d is not applicable because there is no affluence offered as a mitigating \ncondition. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a mature professional \nwho has been married three times, and fathered four children.  He started in the \nworkforce nearly 40 years ago.  He knew he was willfully not paying his income taxes \nfor his own selfish reasons.  He also deliberately decided not to pay his child support as \nordered by a valid court.  He admitted he purposefully chose not to pay certain debts, \nwhile claiming he needed the money to support his children and himself.  His divorce \ndocuments demonstrate a contentious discussion on various expenses he charged to a \ncompany he owned, and his housing expenses during the 2001 to 2004 period.  \nApplicant spent a lot of money on housing and attorneys in that period.  There are no \nbehavioral changes evident, and his actions are voluntary and selfish based on his own \nview of the divorce situation.  His motivations for his conduct were retaliation against his \nsecond wife, and his personal decisions to keep his income for his own needs.  There is \nclearly great potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in this type of \nsituation.  The situation will continue, as declared by Applicant himself.  He will not pay \nthe child support because he considers it a debt he did not incur.  He will not pay \nincome taxes because he does not want any refund to go to his former wife. If he is not \nmaking periodic installment payments on his tax obligations, there will be no refunds to \npay to him. It is also significant that after his bankruptcy discharge in 2005, he incurred \nmore delinquent debt. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted.\nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) signed on September 25, 2007. After reviewing the\nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that\n1\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nFebruary 12, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply\nto all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\n Applicant\u2019s post-hearing documents, submitted as 1.a. through 4.c., were re-marked in accordance with the\n3\nDOHA practice of identifying Applicants\u2019 exhibits with letters. The revised identification is as follows: 1.a.\nthrough 1.e. are re-marked as AE I through AE M; 2.a. through 2.d. are re-marked as AE N through AE Q;\n3.a. and 3.b. are re-marked AE R and AE S; 4.a. through 4.c. are re-marked as AE T through AE V.\nApplicant\u2019s cover letter indicated that his post-hearing submission included item 3.d. (sic), a letter concerning\ncar repairs of January 2007, but that document was not included in the submission.\n2\nOn July 22, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), which\nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2\nApplicant signed his notarized Answer to the SOR on August 27, 2008. In his\nresponse, Applicant denied all allegations in the SOR except the following: \u00b6\u00b6 1.p., 1.q. 1.r.\nand 1.t. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 5, 2008, and the case\nwas assigned to me on September 24, 2008. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October\n22, 2008, setting the hearing date for November 12, 2008. After retaining counsel on\nNovember 5, 2008, Applicant moved to continue the hearing to allow time to adequately\nprepare. The Government did not object to Applicant\u2019s motion. By Order dated November\n7, 2008, I granted Applicant\u2019s request. DOHA issued an Amended Notice of Hearing on\nNovember 10, 2008, and I convened the hearing on December 10, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, the government offered four exhibits, which were marked as\nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 and admitted without objection. Applicant testified,\npresented the testimony of one witness, and offered eight exhibits, which were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, which were also received without objection. I held the\nrecord open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. He timely submitted 14\ndocuments, which were forwarded without objection by Department Counsel. The\ndocuments were admitted as AE I through AE V.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on\n3\nDecember 18, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant, 30 years old, completed tenth grade in approximately 1996. Since that\ntime, he has worked in a fast-food restaurant, as a laborer for a construction company and\n\n The government concedes that allegation 1.e. is a duplicate of allegation 1.b.

He joined his current employer in 2003 as a laborer (GE 1; Tr 30-33).\nApplicant\u2019s security officer testified that he is a reliable and dependable worker who has\nperformed his job consistently and well during the years he has been with the company. (Tr\n105-106). \nApplicant is single. He has three children, aged nine, eleven, and twelve years, with\nMother A. Applicant pays $74 per week in child support for these three children. He also has\none child, six years old, with Mother B. His pays $66 per week support for this child. Child\nsupport payments have been deducted automatically from his paycheck since 2005 (Tr 40;\nGE AE I; AE J). Applicant\u2019s pay stub (AE B) shows weekly pay, without overtime, of $934,\nor approximately $48,000 gross income per year. His net income after deductions is\napproximately $34,000. He lives with his parents to save money (Tr 90). Nevertheless,\nApplicant has accrued delinquent debt.\nApplicant decided to seek help, and a friend at his church referred him to an agency\n(Tr 47). In May 2008, Applicant contacted a credit counseling service. He provided the\norganization with his credit report, so that a plan could be developed that included all his\ndelinquencies (Tr 84). He signed an agreement, and worked out a monthly budget of his\nincome and expenses, and developed a payment plan (GE 4). The original plan required\na payment of $700 per month, which Applicant could not afford. He worked with the agency\non a revised plan that he could manage financially (Tr 81). The agency created a revised\nplan to pay 13 debts over 24 months (AE E; AE T; AE U). Applicant signed the agreement\nin December 2008. After an initial payment of $192, Applicant is scheduled to pay $127.50\nper week, or $510 per month, which will be deducted from his pay (Tr 82).\nThe current status of the alleged debts is as follows:\nAllegations 1.b., 1.c., 1.d, 1.e.,  1.i., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.o. - medical debts - Applicant\n4\nincurred numerous debts because of a medical condition that requires frequent doctor visits\n(Tr 52-53). He failed to pay these debts because he thought they were being paid through\nhis employer\u2019s medical insurance plan. Several of the collection agencies for these debts\nappear in the plan, although the amounts differ from those cited in the SOR.  Applicant\n5\ntestified that the medical debts are included in his consolidation plan (Tr 52-56; 76; AE E).\nAllegations 1.f., 1.h. and 1.n. - communications debts - Two cable debts (1.f. and\n1.h.) are included in Applicant\u2019s consolidation plan. Applicant disputes the remaining $170\ncell-phone debt. He believes this is not his debt, because his cell phone bill is prepaid (Tr\n64; 111).\nAllegation 1.j. - car loan - Applicant initially disputed his obligation to pay for this\nused car because it required several major repairs shortly after he bought it (AE R; AE S;\n\nThe government concedes that allegation 1.s. is a duplicate of allegation 1.a. (Tr 120).\n6\nDirective. 6.3.\n7 \n4\nTr 60-61). However, he accepted responsibility for the debt, contacted the creditor and\nobtained an agreement to a reduced balance of $5,300. He and the creditor also agreed\nto a payment plan of $200 per month for 26 months that started in May 2008 (AE F).\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s counsel stated that the plan had not been formalized, Applicant\ntestified that he is making the monthly payments. I find that AE F supports Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that a plan is in place for this debt (Tr 61-62; AE A; AE F).\nAllegations 1.a., 1.g., 1.p., 1.r., 1.s.,  and 1.t. - child support delinquencies,\n6\nrelated state liens  and incarceration - In 2003, Applicant was paying Mother A directly,\n7\nwithout payroll deductions, but was late in paying. When he did not have the unpaid support\non hand at his court appearance, he was incarcerated overnight until the funds were\nobtained (Tr 50-52). \nApplicant disputes that his child support is delinquent because support payments\nhave been deducted automatically from his pay since 2005 (AE B). He submitted copies of\ncourt orders showing his child support obligations (AE I and J). In addition, a letter from\nApplicant\u2019s security manager indicates that the company has been deducting child support\npayments from his pay for both mothers since 2005 (AE H and V).\nAlthough the state instructed that payments for both families be sent to the state\ndivision of child support enforcement (AE I and J), Applicant\u2019s employer mistakenly sent\npayments for Mother A directly to her. Child support arrearages began to accrue because\nthe state child support office failed to receive payments for Mother A. Ultimately, the state\ncharged Applicant with failure to meet his obligations and filed liens against him. Applicant\ncontacted the division of child support enforcement to determine why he was charged with\nfailing to pay his support. He could not understand why the receipts that were forwarded to\nhim credited him with only part of the amount he was actually paying (Tr 71). Applicant\nrecently learned that his employer\u2019s error, which has continued for several years, has\ncaused the discrepancy (Tr 43). His security officer testified that the situation resulted from\na company error, that it was discovered approximately two weeks before the hearing, and\nthat the error has now been corrected (AE H; V; Tr 100-104).\nAllegation 1.q. - payday loan - After a judgment was filed against Applicant in 2006,\nhe repaid the loan in full in 2007 (AE G; Tr 65-66).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n8\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n10\n5\nGuidelines (AG).   Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\n7\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nIn this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require\nconsideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations).  \n          A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue\n8\nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to\nprove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then\nfalls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.9\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or his own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable\ndoubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.10\nAnalysis\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-extended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\n\n6\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nApplicant has worked as a laborer for more than 10 years. His credit bureau reports\nshow that he has had numerous delinquencies, which began accruing in 2003.\nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b619a (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619c\n(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. There is no evidence of other\ndisqualifying conditions such as frivolous spending, or debts related to alcoholism,\ngambling or deceptive practices.\nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate\nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20b, AG \u00b6 20c, AG \u00b6 20d, and AG \u00b6 20e\napply. \nApplicant\u2019s largest alleged debt relates to child support arrearages. However, the\ndelinquencies resulted not from Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his obligation, but from his\nemployer\u2019s failure to follow the state\u2019s instructions to send Applicant\u2019s payments to the\nstate division of child support enforcement. His employer\u2019s mistake was unknown to\nApplicant and beyond his control. He acted responsibly by contacting the state office and\nobtaining receipts of his payments to try to determine why his payments were not being\ncredited to him. I find that AG \u00b6 20b applies (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances). \nBoth AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\nand AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) apply. Applicant has made sincere efforts to resolve his debts.\nHe initiated a payment plan for his car loan, even though the car appeared to be a\n\u201clemon.\u201d He acted in May 2008, before the SOR was issued, indicating that he was acting\nin good-faith, rather than in response to the security process. His history of child support\npayments going back to 2005 also shows a good-faith effort to meet his obligation to\nsupport his children. In addition, Applicant contacted a financial counseling service in May\n2008 and concluded a payment plan in December. The payment plan includes 13 debts,\n9 of which appear in the SOR (AE E). Not all of the medical debts listed in the SOR are\nincluded in the plan; however, the medical debts that do not appear to be included are not\nsufficient to raise security concerns. Applicant has made a concerted effort to resolve his\ndebts and with this payment plan in place, his debts are under control. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits (AE B - D; AE H - L; AE V) and his security officer\u2019s testimony\nconfirm that the child support debts listed in the SOR stemmed from an error by his\nemployer that has continued for almost four years. Applicant\u2019s child support had in fact\nbeen deducted from his pay during that time, and arrears should not have been accruing.\nI find that AG \u00b6 20(e) applies (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\n\n7\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue).\nWhole Person Analysis  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under the financial considerations guideline,\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts\nand circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant has a stable work history and his security manager attests to his reliability\nas an employee. In the process of supporting himself and four children on his single salary\nas a laborer, he incurred delinquencies amounting to approximately $10,000. The SOR\nalleges $31,200 in delinquent debt (excluding duplicate allegation 1.s.). However, of this\ntotal, Applicant does not owe $21,245 in child support arrears, which the state child\nsupport enforcement division charged as delinquent because of a mistake by Applicant\u2019s\nemployer. He made good-faith efforts to resolve the remaining debts by initiating a\npayment plan for his automobile loan, seeking counseling, and establishing a reasonable\npayment plan under which payments on his remaining debts will be deducted from his\nsalary.\nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline F\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.t.\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to classified\ninformation. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted.\nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nOn July 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence and Guideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 13, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on August 25, 2008, and reassigned to me on September 16, \nOctober 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 9, 2008. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on September 23, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non September 30, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Cuba. Applicant did not object and the request was approved. \nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The facts administratively noticed are \nset out in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nreceived without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born in \nCuba. He attended college in Cuba for a period but did not graduate. While in college \nhis eyes were opened to the nature of the Cuban government and the opportunities and \nfreedom that the United States offered. He attempted to escape Cuba on a raft in 1988. \nHe was unsuccessful and returned to Cuba. He left college and went to work. He \neventually met his ex-wife in Havana. She is a United States citizen. She visited him in \nCuba on several occasions and they married in 1994. She sponsored him to immigrate \nto the United States. Applicant came to the U.S. in 1995. They divorced in 1997. He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2000.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and one brother are citizens and residents of Cuba. His \nfamily members are farmers with no direct connection to the Cuban government. He \nalso has extended family members, including cousins, who are citizens and residents of \nCuba. He has another brother that is a Cuban citizen who lives in the U.S. with \nApplicant as a permanent resident. He also has other cousins who are Cuban citizens \nliving in the United States.2  \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 17-21, 26-27; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 23-24, 27-30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant visited Cuba on four occasions between 2001 and 2007. He started \ndating a Cuban citizen during his trips to Cuba. He has known her since they were in \nschool. They married in Cuba during his trip there in 2007. Applicant has no children. \nHe has sponsored his wife to immigrate to the United States and he hopes that she will \nbe able to arrive here by the end of 2008. She was an office worker with no association \nwith the Cuban government, but she is currently not working.3 \n \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Cuba. He continued to \nmaintain and use a Cuban passport after he became a U.S. citizen. He used his Cuban \npassport on all his trips to Cuba, but has never used it in a third country. He possesses \na current Cuban passport that was issued in 2006, and is valid until 2012. He intends to \nmaintain the Cuban passport in case he has to travel to Cuba on short notice if there is \nany kind of emergency.4  \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. He sends his wife about $100 a \nmonth and his parents about $300 every six months. He also sends clothes and \nmedicine. He calls his wife about once a week and his mother about once a month. He \ncalls his brother about every three months. He has a stable employment history and his \nperformance appraisal indicates that he is an excellent employee.5 \n \nCuba \n \nCuba is a totalitarian state. The government controls all aspects of life through \nthe Communist Party and its affiliated organizations. It has a poor human rights record \nincluding unlawful killings; beatings, and abuse of detainees and prisoners; harsh prison \nconditions; arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights advocates; denial of fair trial; \npervasive monitoring of private communications; limitations on freedom of speech and \npress; denial of peaceful assembly and association; and restrictions on freedom of \nmovement, including selective denial of exit permits. The government and its agents are \nnot known to engage in politically motivated killings or disappearances, but dissidents \nrisk being jailed.  \n \nCuba is a state sponsor of terrorism and maintains close relationships with other \nstate sponsors of terrorism such as Iran and Syria. The Cuban government has long \ntargeted the U.S. for intensive espionage. Cuba\u2019s modus operandi in espionage \noperations is to use spies to infiltrate U.S. activities and U.S.-based anti-government \norganizations. The U.S. and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the early \n1960s. U.S. policy has been to isolate Cuba through comprehensive economic \nsanctions. At the same time, the U.S. has supported humanitarian efforts and continues \nto work for a \u201cFree Cuba.\u201d  \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 33, 35-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 34-35; AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife, parents, and brother are citizens and residents of Cuba. He has \nvisited his family in Cuba on four occasions between 2001 and 2007. Another brother \nlives with Applicant. He is a Cuban citizen, but a U.S. permanent resident. Cuba has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Communist Party. It is a state sponsor of \nterrorism, and the government of Cuba has committed numerous, serious human rights \nabuses against its people. It also targets the U.S. for espionage. His family members\u2019 \npresence in Cuba creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion, both through him and through his brother in the \nU.S. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) have been \nraised by the evidence. Applicant\u2019s contacts and connections to his extended family \nmembers in Cuba are not enough to create a conflict of interest, or a heightened risk of \n\n \n6 \n \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. SOR \u00b6 1.f is \nconcluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has been in this country for about 13 years and has been a U.S. citizen \nsince 2000. His brother lives with him and he has a good job where he is a valued \nemployee. However, because of his close family ties to Cuba and the nature of the \nCuban government, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \n\n \n7 \n \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n  \nApplicant possesses a current Cuban passport, which is a right and privilege of \nforeign citizenship. AG \u00b6 10(a) is applicable. The renewal of his Cuban passport while a \nU.S. citizen could also raise concerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain \nrecognition of his Cuban citizenship.  \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant was \u201cunwilling to surrender [his] Cuban \npassport.\u201d This is true. However, the possession of the Cuban passport is already \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. SOR \u00b6 2.c does not allege a separate disqualifying fact; it alleges \nthat Applicant does not meet a mitigating condition, as addressed below. A failure to \nmeet a mitigating condition should not be the basis of a separate allegation. SOR \u00b6 2.c \nis concluded for Applicant.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant actively sought recognition of his Cuban citizenship by renewing his \nCuban passport after he became an American citizen. He is maintaining the passport to \nvisit his family and for use in an emergency. As such, he is unwilling to renounce the \ndual citizenship that accompanies the Cuban passport. No mitigating condition is \ncompletely applicable.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Cuba. He \nrealized when he was in college that he wanted the freedoms we enjoy in the United \nStates. He attempted to escape Cuba on a raft but was unsuccessful. He eventually \nmarried a U.S. citizen and fulfilled his dream of coming to America. He became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2000. He was obviously sincere, open, and honest at his hearing. He has \nthrived in the United States and is recognized by his company as an excellent \nemployee.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Cuba, The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. Cuba has an authoritarian government, a bad human rights record, is a state \nsponsor of terrorism, and conducts espionage against the United States. Applicant has \na significant amount of close family members who are citizens and residents of Cuba. \nHe has maintained his Cuban citizenship and passport because it is necessary if he \nwants to visit them. There is no evidence that Applicant is anything other than an \nintelligent, honest, trustworthy, and loyal U.S. citizen. He just was unable to mitigate the \nconsiderable security concerns raised by his ties to Cuba. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n9 \n \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old computer systems analyst who has worked for a federal contractor since November 2007. Applicant attended college from 2000 to 2005, graduating in May 2005, with a degree in computer systems. He married in March 2008 and has no children. Applicant incurred student loan debts while attending college. He also incurred credit card debts that were used for living expenses while he was in college. He made some payments on these debts for a period of time. He received grants and reduced tuition for three of his five years in college. He was employed while attending college, but lost his job. He had difficulty finding another job during this time and got behind in his obligations. After he graduated he attempted to find a full time job. During this time he worked part-time jobs to support himself, but it was not enough to pay his student loans and credit card debts and they became delinquent. Six months after applying for a job with his current employer he was hired.1 The debt listed in SOR 1.a does not belong to Applicant. The government conceded that the debt is not Applicant\u2019s responsibility.2 The debts listed in SOR 1.b and 1.c are the same as the debt listed in SOR 1.l and 1.m. Applicant contacted the creditor for his student loan",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 2, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 8, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 10, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nthrough L which were admitted without objections. The record was left open until \nSeptember 18, 2009 to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documents, \nwhich he did. The documents were marked as AE M through Q and being no objection \nfrom Department Counsel, they were admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on September 18, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old computer systems analyst who has worked for a \nfederal contractor since November 2007. Applicant attended college from 2000 to 2005, \ngraduating in May 2005, with a degree in computer systems. He married in March 2008 \nand has no children. \n \n \nApplicant incurred student loan debts while attending college. He also incurred \ncredit card debts that were used for living expenses while he was in college. He made \nsome payments on these debts for a period of time. He received grants and reduced \ntuition for three of his five years in college. He was employed while attending college, \nbut lost his job. He had difficulty finding another job during this time and got behind in \nhis obligations. After he graduated he attempted to find a full time job. During this time \nhe worked part-time jobs to support himself, but it was not enough to pay his student \nloans and credit card debts and they became delinquent. Six months after applying for a \njob with his current employer he was hired.1  \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.a does not belong to Applicant. The government \nconceded that the debt is not Applicant\u2019s responsibility.2 \n \n \nThe debts listed in SOR 1.b and 1.c are the same as the debt listed in SOR 1.l \nand 1.m. Applicant contacted the creditor for his student loans and consolidated all of \nhis student loan debts.3 He set up a payment plan with the creditor, made consistent \npayments, whereupon they agreed to remove his loans from a delinquent status and \npermitted him to defer regular monthly payments until January 2009. Applicant is using \nthe monthly payment amount he had been paying for his student loans to pay off other \ndebts. He will resume paying his student loans in January 2009 as permitted by the \ncreditor.4  \n \n \n1 Tr. 50-62. \n \n2 Tr. 21-22. \n \n3 The debts listed in SOR 1.b, and 1.c are the same debts as listed in 1.l and 1.m. The creditor \nlisted in SOR 1.b and 1.c bought the loans from the creditors in 1.l and 1.m.  \n \n4 Tr. 22-36; AE D and G. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe debts listed in SOR 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.k and 1.j have been consolidated \nand are included in a debt management program. Applicant has been making consistent \nautomatic monthly payments of $258 toward this program to reduce and satisfy these \ndebts.5  \n \n \nApplicant has paid the debt listed in SOR 1.i.6  \n \n \nApplicant is married, but he and his wife each live with their parents to save \nmoney until he pays off his delinquent debts. He pays nominal rent and other household \nexpenses. He earns approximately $25,000 a year (before taxes). He does not have \nany credit cards. He owns a 1991 car that is paid for. He anticipates with the debt \nmanagement program he will have his delinquent debts paid off in 12 months, excluding \nhis student loans. The debts he incurred were while he was in college. He was working \nwhile in college, but the company dissolved and he lost his job. He did find other work \nwhile in college and paid what he could, but it was not enough to keep up. He \nunderstands his duty to be fiscally responsible and now that he has a job he is anxious \nto pay his delinquent debts and attain his career goals. He has a budget that he abides \nby.7  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n \n5 Tr. 36-48; AE J, N, O, P and Q. At his hearing Applicant thought that SOR 1.e and 1.k might \nhave been the same debt. The additional documents provided confirm they are not and he has provided \nsupporting documents to show he added the debt in 1.k to his debt management program. \n \n6 Tr. 44-45, 59; AE I. \n \n7 Tr. 56-64. \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Appellant had \ndelinquent debts that he failed to pay when due. I find the evidence raised both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising form financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b620 (a) (\u201cThe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation\u201d), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u2018the person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).  \n \n \nApplicant incurred debts while he was in college. He paid his bills while he was \nemployed, but lost his job and had difficulty finding a new job. During this period of time \nhe got behind in paying his bills. When he graduated from college he had a difficult time \nfinding a full time job. He worked at low paying part-time jobs until he was hired by his \ncurrent employer. Since becoming employed in November 2007, he has consolidated \nhis student loans and brought them out of a default status and they are now deferred \nuntil January 2009. He has placed his other debts in a debt consolidation program and \nis making consistent automatic monthly payments. Those debts not included in the \nprogram were paid. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his debts happened under circumstances \nthat are unlikely to recur. He acted responsibly when he gained employment. Therefore, \nI find his actions do not cast doubt on his trustworthiness, reliability or good judgment. \nApplicant did not merely disregard his debts; he was unable to pay them because he \nwas attempting to find employment. Once he got a job he resumed his payments, \nconsolidated his debts and started paying his student loans. I find the conditions that \ncaused the financial problems were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and once he got back on \nhis feet he acted responsibly and addressed his debts. Therefore, I find (b) applies. \nApplicant did not present evidence that he has received financial counseling, but there \nare clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Therefore, I find (c) applies. Applicant has all of his debts consolidated and is \nmaking consistent monthly payments through automatic withdrawal from his account. I \nfind he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors and (d) applies.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who has \njust started his career. He incurred credit card and student loan debts while attending \ncollege. He worked part-time in school to help defray his expenses. While employed he \npaid his debts. Once he graduated he had difficulty finding a job. He lives at home and \npays his parents nominal rent and contributes towards the household expenses. \nAlthough he is married he and his wife do not live together because he wants to pay off \nall of his debts first. He is managing his money. He has a student loan deferment and is \npaying his other debts. He plans to completely pay off all of his delinquent debts within a \nyear. He does not have any credit cards. He owns an old car. He has many goals and \nhopes to progress in his career. He understands the importance of paying his bills and \nnow that he has a job he is committed to being fiscally responsible. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The Applicant is 34 years old and he has completed about eighteen months at a junior college. He is employed by a defense contractor as a painter and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits and takes responsibility for each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. Credit reports of the Applicant dated December 26, 2007, October 18, 2008, and February 13, 2009, reflect that he is indebted to at least ten separate creditors in the amount of approximately $66,488.00.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 14, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated December 2, 2007.  On November 21, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 21, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on February 17, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nFebruary 23, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 12, 2009.  The Government\noffered seven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant offered five exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through E, and  testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until\nclose of business on March 26, 2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit\nadditional documentation.  Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit.  The transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) was received on March 23, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case\n\n2\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 34 years old and he has completed\nabout eighteen months at a junior college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\npainter and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits and takes responsibility for each of the allegations set forth\nin the SOR under this guideline.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated December 26,\n2007, October 18, 2008, and February 13, 2009, reflect that he is indebted to at least\nten separate creditors in the amount of approximately $66,488.00.  (Government\nExhibits 2, 4 and 5).  \nUp until May 2002, the Applicant had always paid his bills on time and he had a\nperfect credit record.  In May 2002, he moved to a small town in Florida with his\ngirlfriend.  They lived in an apartment with her mother for a while.  He was unable to find\nemployment and was forced to start living off of his credit cards.  At the time, he had a\nmotorcycle payment, and living expenses to pay.  Although he was always searching for\nemployment, from October 2001 through all of 2002, he was without a job.  In January\n2003, he became employed as a night security guard.  The job was low paying and only\nenough to cover his rent, utilities and food.  He and his girlfriend broke up, and he had\nto move into his own apartment, \u201cthe cheapest he could find\u201d, which cost him even\nmore.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  \nIn 2007, in search of a better paying job, the Applicant moved back to California,\nmoved in with his mother, who agreed to allow him to live with her until his delinquent\ndebts are paid in full, and started looking for employment.  In December 2008, he was\nhired by his current employer and found the \u201cjob of a lifetime\u201d.  He immediately started\nsaving money to pay his delinquent debts.    \nInitially he had planned on saving his money and paying everything off all of his\ndelinquent debt in one lump sum.  (Tr. p. 51).  He currently has $7,000.00 in one of his\naccounts and $3,400.00 in another.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  He later learned about a\nconsumer credit counselor who could assist him.\n\n3\nShortly after receiving the SOR, the Applicant hired a consumer credit counselor\nto assist him in resolving his delinquent debt.  Applicant explained that a settlement\ncoach is a professional negotiator whose job it is to eliminate late fees that may have\nbeen added to his initial debt, and settle the debt for less.  Each of the delinquent debts\nlisted in the SOR are being addressed as part of the payment program.  The payment\nprogram provides that he will make monthly installments of $631.19, starting February\n26, 2009, for 48 months that will pay off his delinquent debt in the amount of\n$53.653.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, E and Post-Hearing Exhibit).  He has already made\ntwo payments under the plan.  He strongly desires to tackle this debt and restore his\ngood credit.         \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor dated March 11, 2009, states that the\nApplicant is a valuable employee to the company because of his work ethic.  He has\nbeen an \u201cexemplary employee\u201d, receiving only positive feedback from customers and\ncoworkers.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s friends and family attest to his\nhonesty, good judgment and reliability.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he intentionally falsified material\naspects of his personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing dated December 2, 2007.  Question 27(a) asked whether, in the last seven\nyears, he had any judgments against him that have not been paid.  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  \nQuestion 28(a) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if he had been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government\nExhibit 1).  This was a false answer.   Question 28(b) of the same application asked the\nApplicant if he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any of his debts.  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 1).  This was also a false answer.     \nThe Applicant explained that at the time he completed the questionnaire he was\npressed for time and initially answered \u201cyes\u201d to each of the questions in issue.  The\ncomputer program then popped up a space requiring him to insert the amount owed,\nwith the inability to move any further through the document.  The Applicant did not have\nthe information.  He knew at the time that a thorough background investigation would\noccur and he would have the opportunity to meet with an investigator to fully explain his\nfinancial situation.  He decided to simply answer the questions, \u201cNO\u201d with the\nunderstanding that he could explain later.  He had no intent to deceive the Government\nor conceal material information.  Ordinarily, this explanation would not be credible, but\ngiven the sincerity, honesty and demeanor of this particular Applicant, it is acceptable.\n      \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n5\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\nNone.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant\u2019s long period of unemployment and even longer period of\nunderemployment caused his financial problems.  There is no evidence of an expensive\nlifestyle, lavish spending or gambling.  He has been frugal and responsible about paying\nhis delinquent debts first.  He has incurred no new debt.  He has reduced his expenses\nby purchasing an inexpensive vehicle, all cash, and has moved in with his mother.  He\nhas been working for his current employer for shortly over a year and has been doing\nan outstanding job.  He has hired a consumer credit counselor, set up a payment plan\nand is currently paying each of his delinquent creditors.  He will continue to make\nmonthly payments under the program until he is debt free.  Under the particular\ncircumstances of this case, I find that the Applicant has done his best, given the\nexcessive nature of the debts, and has made a good faith effort to resolve them.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.\nFinally, with respect to his finances, the Applicant must continue to make his monthly\npayments under his payment plan, addressing each delinquent debt in the SOR.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\n\n7\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Here, the Applicant\nhad initiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his\ndebts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  \nWith respect to the allegations of falsification on the security clearance\nquestionnaire, I do not find that they are supported by the evidence.  Accordingly,\nGuideline E is found for the Applicant.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",
