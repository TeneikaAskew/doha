At the conclusion of the hearing, I proposed \nthat this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor.

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. She has been employed as a security specialist since \n1991, and has worked for her current employer since 2013. She has held a security \nclearance since 1991, and it was last renewed in 2016. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2017. She has been married since 2004, and has three adult children. (Item 2) \nApplicant stated that her financial problems are due to reasons beyond her \ncontrol, including medical issues that have required treatment and short term medical \nleave from work. Her spouse also had medical issues and disabilities, which impacted \nhis employability. Her adult daughter and two grandchildren live in Applicant\u2019s home. \nHer daughter and grandchild were severely injured in a car accident in 2019, which \ncreated a personal and financial strain on the family. (Items 1, 2, 3) \nIn her Answer, Applicant stated that she has been trying to resolve her \noutstanding debts by contacting her creditors, and making payment arrangements that \nfit within her budget. She also disputed debts that she believes are reported in error. \nShe stated that she is committed to continue resolving outstanding debts, and improving \nher financial situation. (Item 1) \nIn her February 2020 interview, Applicant provided information about her monthly \nbudget to the government investigator. It showed she had approximately $275 monthly \nthat she could apply to debt payments, beyond the debt payments she was already \nmaking. Applicant did not provide evidence that she has received credit counseling. \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts, totaling about $61,000. About $50,000 of \nthe debt resulted from Applicant\u2019s student loans. Applicant also has seven small past-\ndue medical debts and nine past-due consumer and utility accounts. The allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and the four credit reports in the record: October \n10, 2019 (Item 4); January 24, 2020 (Item 5); September 6, 2020 (Item 6), and \nNovember 10, 2021 (Item 7).

(Item 1; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.t are delinquent student loans totaling $50,190. In her SCA, she \nstated that her student loans became delinquent because of the loss of her spouse\u2019s \nincome, and a medical condition that required her to be on short-term medical leave for \ntwo months. Applicant reached out to the creditors, and made a payment arrangement \nwith them, to bring the accounts current. Her two most recent credit reports in the \nrecord, September 2020, and November 2021, show all eight of her student loan \naccounts as current, with no amount past due. These credit reports also report the \nstatus of each account as \u201cpays as agreed\u201d. (Items 1, 2, 5, 7) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.l are duplicated allegations for the same past-due debt of \n$376. One is owed to the original creditor, and the other is owed to a subsequent \ncollection agency. Applicant reached out to the creditor to verify the debt, but has been \nunable to get documentation from the creditor to make payment arrangements. (Items \n1, 6, 7) SOR \u00b6 1.l is resolved for Applicant as a duplicate. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a $139 debt in collection to an insurance company. In her Answer, \nApplicant states that she spoke to the creditor to make arrangements, but they could not \nfind the account in their records. (Items 1, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a $137 charged-off debt for home furnishings. Applicant \ndocumented that the debt has been paid. (Items 1, 6; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a $117 debt in collection to an insurance company. In her Answer, \nApplicant states that the debt is now paid, and that this creditor is her current insurance \nprovider. However, no documentation was provided. (Items 1, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k concerns an auto repossession, and a charged off debt of $8,188. \nApplicant leased a vehicle in early 2018. She missed a payment in mid-2019, because \nher husband had lost his job due to medical issues. The lender told her that she had to \npay the remaining balance in full, or turn in the vehicle. She was unable to pay the \nbalance in full, and opted to return the car. She asserts that the account was closed \nwhen the vehicle was turned in, and she owes them nothing, however, she did not \nprovide any documentation to corroborate her claim. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.u is a credit account that was charged off in the amount of $661. \nApplicant asserts that this debt was a loan she obtained while out of work due to a \nmedical condition. Her spouse was also out of work at that time. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor, and she was told that they could no longer locate the account in their records. \nThe debt appeared as a charge off on her October 2019 and January 2020 credit \nreports. However, the September 2020 and November 2021 credit reports show a zero \nbalance.

(Items 1, 3, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.w is a debt in collection to a phone company in the amount of $72. \nApplicant denies this debt and has disputed it. She states that the creditor told her that \nthey no longer possessed this account. (Items 1, 2, 3, 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. SOR \u00b6 1.l is a duplicate of SOR \ndebt \u00b6 1.b, so it is not established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are largely due to a variety of circumstances beyond her \ncontrol, including medical issues, job instability for both her and her husband, and a \nserious car accident involving several family members that caused a personal and \nfinancial strain that impacted her ability to address her debts. The first prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(b) therefore applies. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows that she is paying her debts and making reasonable \nefforts to investigate and resolve them. The bulk of Applicant\u2019s alleged delinquencies \nare her approximately $50,000 in student loans. These debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.t) are \nnow current, as established by recent credit reports. Applicant has also consolidated her \nmedical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.g. 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.x), and is making payments on \nthem. She has also established that she is paying and seeking to resolve her various \nother debts. Several of her consumer debts, such as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.u, have also \nbeen resolved. \nSimilarly, Applicant provided sufficient evidence that she has undertaken good-\nfaith efforts to address her debts. She has contacted her creditors to verify her debts \nand make payment arrangements. She provided evidence that some of the debts have \nbeen paid or are being paid, and her recent credit reports show that some of the debts \nare resolved. \nApplicant is not required to show that she has paid or resolved all of her debts, or \nthat she has done so in any particular way. She need only show that she has a \nreasonable plan in place to resolve her debts, and that she has taken steps towards \nimplementing it. Applicant has done so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply because Applicant still has unresolved debts. \nApplicant documented that the debt at \u00b6 1.e has been paid, so AG \u00b6 20(e) \napplies. It does not apply to the other debts she denied as she did not document the \nbasis of her dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not fully apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant established that a significant portion of her SOR debts are resolved or \nbeing paid. She has contacted creditors, and made payment arrangements, where \npossible. Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent due to circumstances beyond her \ncontrol. Given her long career as a security specialist, and her good faith efforts in \nresolving her debts, I believe that she has met her burden of mitigating the financial \nconsiderations security concerns arising out of her delinquent debts under Guideline F. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.x: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nclearance.

The recent bankruptcy is not alleged in the SOR. \n(Item 1.) \nWhen Applicant divorced in 2008, he lost the income of his spouse. Applicant tried \nto pay all of his bills, but he fell behind. Applicant also had to pay $200 per month child \nsupport for his then minor children. That led to his first bankruptcy, in 2013. Applicant lost \nhis job in about 2018 and had a period of unemployment (dates not specified). The jobs t \nApplicant could find paid less than he needed. Due to Covid pandemic health concerns, \njob opportunities became more limited. Because of a service-related injury, Applicant \ncould not take some jobs that required him to stand for long periods of time. He hopes to \nqualify for some disability benefits. Applicant is unsure when that might happen. There is \nno evidence that Applicant made any payments, established any payment plans, or \ncontacted his creditors. (Items 2 and 4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nDiscussion \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the \nconcern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \nThe overall concern is stated in AG \u00b6 18: Failure to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPotentially Disqualifying Factors \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nPotentially Mitigating Factors \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had problematic financial \nconditions that raise a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F. He appears to have \nbeen unable to satisfy his debts, and he has a history of not meeting his financial \nobligations. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and (c) apply. The next inquiry is whether any of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \nThe debts that raised trustworthiness concerns were delinquent when the SOR \nwas issued in August 2021 and remained in arrears when the FORM was filed. Those \ndebts were neither infrequent, nor did they occur long ago. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant enumerated a host of reasons that caused his dire financial straits. His \ndivorce, child support, unemployment, under-employment, and Covid-caused limits on \njob opportunities are \u201cconditions . . . largely beyond\u201d Applicant\u2019s control. The inquiry under \nAG \u00b6 20(b), however, does not end there. Applicant must also offer proof of how he \nresponded responsibly to the adverse circumstances he confronted about his debts. He \nhas not done so here. Serial Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings are not responsible conduct \nwhen trying to resolve delinquent debts. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nConclusion \nThe record creates doubt about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n   \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________________ \nevidence or vice versa.

He \nexplained that, \u201cI erred in answering this question and I now acknowledge that I was \nterminated from [Government contractor employer] for coming to work intoxicated. I had \nbeen up late the night before celebrating my 71st  birthday and should not have gone to \nwork at 6 am, my usual start of my shift. I found it hard to believe at the time that I could \nhave had a measurable quantity in my system.

He explained, \u201cSame as \n1.a. above.\u201d \nAlthough not alleged, it is noteworthy that in addition to the two Guideline E \nallegations discussed, infra, Applicant also told two different versions about his \ntermination from his Government contractor employer in July 2019. While he told the \nOPM investigator that he showed up for work with alcohol in his system from drinking \nthe night before, he told his doctor that he had been terminated from his job after \nreturning from lunch with alcohol on his breath. (Item 6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) through 22(d). \nFurther inquiry is necessary about the potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAlthough the term \u201cbinge\u201d drinking is not defined in the Directive, the generally \naccepted definition of binge drinking for males is the consumption of five or more drinks \nin about two hours or \u201cas a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol \nconcentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent - or 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter - or higher.\u201d \nFor a typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming 5 or more drinks (male), or 4 \nor more drinks (female), in about 2 hours. The definition of binge drinking was approved \nby the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) National Advisory \nCouncil in February 2004. See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, NIAAA \nNewsletter 3 (Winter 2004 No. 3), https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/\nwinter2004/Newsletter Number3.pdf\n \n. See also NIAA website, \u201cDrinking Levels \nDefined,\u201d \nhttps://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcoholconsumption/ \nmoderate- binge-drinking. Applicant\u2019s BAC for the 2019 DUI is high enough to establish \nhe engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. \nFour alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. \nBd. Sept. 24, 2013): \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant did provide some \nimportant mitigating information. After his 2019 DUI arrest, he completed a nine-month \nDUI program, which consisted of 40 hours of community service, attended 30 Alcoholics \nAnonymous meetings, 30 individual counseling sessions, and weekly group counseling \nmeetings from February 2020 to December 2020. He did not have an alcohol-related \ncriminal offense in two years. He acknowledged his excessive alcohol consumption, \nprovided evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and claimed that he \nestablished a pattern of responsible use. See AG \u00b6 23(b). \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant has a lengthy \nhistory of self-admitted excessive alcohol consumption, was diagnosed with alcohol \ndependence and alcohol use disorder (severe) in 2019, continues to consume alcohol, \nwas arrested for a DUI in 2019, and was fired from his Government contractor job in \n2019 for going to work intoxicated. As noted under the personal conduct section, supra, \nApplicant deliberately failed to report his alcohol-related termination, which indicates the \nadverse and negative impact his drinking has had on him. This calls into question not \nonly his truthfulness, but the degree to which he is willing to admit that he has a \nproblem. As also noted, he told two versions surrounding his termination. This pattern of \nminimization and unwillingness to be forthcoming raises larger questions about \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a clearance and compounds the significant issues raised from \nhis problems with alcohol. \nIn spite of this history, Applicant claimed in his SOR Answer that he \n\u201coccasionally\u201d has a beer when he is at home. The only documentation that \naccompanied Applicant\u2019s February 1, 2021 SOR Answer was in large part his written \nanswers which are quoted verbatim, supra. He did not submit any evidence that would \nhave demonstrated his behavior happened under unusual circumstances, that the \nbehavior is unlikely to recur, or does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. Nor did he submit any evidence of actions taken to \novercome his problem or that would demonstrate a clear and established pattern or \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations.

It is too soon to \nconclude alcohol-related incidents involving the police and courts or compromise of \nclassified information are unlikely to recur. Not enough time has elapsed without \nalcohol-related misconduct to eliminate doubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Alcohol consumption security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nPersonal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s September 28, 2019 SF-86 asked clear and easily understood \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s employment record and negative impact alcohol may have \nhad on his work performance. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, and by his own admission \nan extensive history of holding security clearances. He was required to disclose any \nalcohol-related work terminations or the negative impact alcohol use may have had on \nhis work performance. Applicant said he \u201cerred\u201d when answering these questions and \nacknowledged that he was \u201cwrong\u201d in answering the questions the way he did. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the \nrecord evidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May \n30, 2017). As a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent \nor state of mind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, \nbut rather may rely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nI find that Applicant understood the questions on his 2019 SF-86 about his 2019 \ntermination, or the negative impact alcohol has had on his work performance, and he \nintentionally failed to disclose this information with intent to deceive. \nThe record establishes disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a). Further inquiry is \nnecessary about the potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \nemployment termination or the negative impact his alcohol use had on his work \nperformance.

Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nConclusion \nI have reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the majority of his adult \nlife, and he is presumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other \ninformation suggesting his long-standing alcohol-related problems are being \nappropriately addressed, doubts remain about his suitability for access to classified \ninformation. Protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these \nadjudications. Accordingly, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, and mitigate the alcohol \nconsumption and personal conduct security concerns. By failing to provide such \ninformation, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to fully establish \nmitigation, alcohol consumption and personal conduct security concerns remain. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:   \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of two exhibits (GEs 1-2) and a request for administrative notice of the \ncountry of France. Department Counsel\u2019s official notice request covered one document \naddressing U.S. relations with France. Administrative notice was taken of Government \nsource documents covered by the administrative notice request without objection, in \naccordance with Federal Rules of Evidence 201(a). See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 10 n.2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2020). \nThe Government\u2019s administrative notice request was accepted as H1. The \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of two exhibits (GEs 1-2). Applicant relied on nine \nexhibits (A-I) and one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 2, \n2022. \nBefore the close of the hearing, I asked, sua sponte, the parties to brief the \nsubject of adultery as a potential security concern. For good cause shown, the parties \nwere afforded 14 days to brief the issue. (Tr. 152) Within the time permitted Department \nCounsel briefed the issue and concluded that adultery is not an issue of security \nconcern in this case. Department Counsel\u2019s supplemental submission was received as \nHE 2. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly (a) has a girlfriend since about July 2017, \nwho is married and is a citizen and resident of France; (b) paid his girlfriend \napproximately $11,252 in U.S. dollars between March 2020 and June 2020 for rent and \nother expenses; (c) purchased an apartment in France in December 2020, worth \napproximately $1,106,679 (\u20ac908,176); (d) maintains four personal business and \ninvestment accounts with foreign institutions, in addition to the mortgage account, and \nhas approximately $602,000 in assets divided between those accounts; (e) created a \nFrench property investment company in order to obtain a mortgage on the French \napartment covered in SOR \u00b6 1.c; (f) maintains contact with an individual who serves in \nthe French government with the National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI); and \nplans to retire in France in about 2025. \nUnder Guideline C, Applicant allegedly was offered employment in a civilian \norganization in Italy in July 2018. Allegedly, Applicant denied the offer. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the allegations but \ndenied some of the specific details of the allegations with explanations. He claimed the \ntotal amount of money-transfers he paid to his girlfriend approximated $12,414 and \nposes no potential to be a foreign influence concern. He also provided detailed \ninformation about the various financial accounts he holds in France. Applicant further \nclaimed that the individual with whom he maintained 15 years of contact with while \nApplicant was employed by a U.S. intelligence agency (before his retirement in March \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2017) was his counterpart within the French government and a source of informational \nexchanges on a number of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and multilateral \nprograms. And, Applicant claimed that having a person like himself, who has a NATO \nand U.S. security clearance, would enhance his value to his current company. \nAddressing the allegations covered by Guideline C, Applicant claimed that he \nwas not looking for employment when he was approached with a job proposal by a \ncivilian company in Italy. He claimed that the Italian company\u2019s interest in him was \nlinked to the working relationships he developed while working together as a U.S. \nintelligence agency employee on NATO secure communication projects. He further \nclaimed that while the Italian offer presented an interesting and challenging prospect, he \nrejected the offer over concerns that his employment by the Italian company could result \nin his losing his U.S. security clearance. And, Applicant claimed that like his great \ngrandparents and grandparents who emigrated from Italy, and became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens, he, too, took an oath to protect the U.S. Constitution and has never wavered or \nchanged in his defense of that oath. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 65-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant admitted each of the allegations with explanations. \nAllegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated and \nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in June 1979, legally separated in June 2019, and divorced in \nOctober 2020. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 20-21, 88, 135) He has two adult children from this \nmarriage. (GE 1; Tr. 20) Applicant earned a high school diploma in May 1975. (GE 1) \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1979 in engineering and a master\u2019s degree in \nMay 1984 in electrical engineering. Additionally, Applicant completed Ph. D. course-\nwork requirements during his four years of study at the same academic institution where \nhe earned his master\u2019s degree, except for his dissertation. (GE 1 and AE H) Applicant \nreported no military service. \nSince March 2019, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as a senior \nsystems engineer. (GEs 1-2 and AE\u2019s A and H; Tr. 21-22) This contractor is a U.S. \ncorporation headquartered in the United States, with offices located in communities \nthroughout the United States The contractor provides high-speed satellite internet \naccess to customers located in communities with limited or no direct satellite and cable \ninternet connections. Applicant\u2019s principal role with this company is to provide key \nmanagement expertise to aid the company\u2019s meshing of its network satellite system for \ndistribution. (Tr. 22) Applicant also provides expertise for his company\u2019s development of \nkey cryptography certificates for use in high assurance devices across the world.

He used this time to make a number of \ntrips to France with an interest in pursuing painting. (GE 2 and AEs G-H; Tr. 75-76, 89-\n104) For the previous 39 years, he was employed by a U.S. intelligence agency as a \nsenior technical leader before retiring from federal service in March 2017. (GEs 1-2 and \nAEs A and G-H; Tr. 23, 32) Applicant currently holds security clearances with both the \nUnited States and NATO. (GEs 1-2 and AE A; Tr. 25) Applicant\u2019s current employer \nholds both U.S. and NATO facility clearances. (Tr. 82-83)  \nApplicant has held a U.S. security clearance continuously since 1979, and has \nnever been reprimanded for any infractions, either in his federal service, or while he has \nbeen employed by his current employer. (Tr. 24-25) In addition to his work with his \ncurrent full-time employer, Applicant provides some extra part-time consulting services \nfor another firm that does not require a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 86-87) \nFollowing his retirement from federal service, Applicant relied on his annual \npension he earned under the civilian service retirement system (CSRS) of around \n$118,000 per year. The pension covers his earned 39 years of uninterrupted federal \nservice. (GE 2 and AEs A and G-H) With his federal agency employer, he served as his \nagency\u2019s senior technical leader and worked in his agency\u2019s research directorate. In his \nwork, he regularly interfaced with his NATO counterparts from France and Italy, inter \nalia, in developing secure encryption devices that meet NATO interoperable \nrequirements. (AEs A and G-H; Tr. 24-28, 140, 146) His contributions included cutting \nedge research on the development of training algorithms designed to produce superior \nvector quantizing codebooks used in coding algorithms. (AEs A and G-H; Tr. 24-25) \nIn or about July 2017, Applicant met a French woman (a married citizen and \nresident of France) through a close former NATO friend from his time with a U.S. \nintelligence agency who invited him to spend summers painting in France. (GE 1; Tr. \n45-46) He established a friendship with this French woman. (GE 2; Tr. 142) Over the \ncourse of the ensuing three years, the friendship grew into an intimate one that included \nfrequent cohabitation in their respective residences. (GE 2 and AE A; Tr. 43-44, 87) \nThis French girlfriend is a retired teacher with no known ties to the French government. \n(Tr. 50-52) She has two grown children and deceased parents. While her husband (a \nfarmer from Southern France) has considerable family wealth (Tr. 44-47), she has only \nher disability pension and a small inheritance from her mother to support herself. (Tr. \n109-110) \nIn the early months of his relationship with his French girlfriend, Applicant would \nrent her old apartment while he was in France. (Tr. 102) Part of the time when he \noccupied her apartment, she stayed with him. (Tr. 105-106) During their relationship, \nshe confided in him about her ongoing emotional struggles with her husband and \nintentions to separate and divorce him, citing her claims of infidelity and verbal abuse. \n(Tr. 43-44, 46-47) Should her husband ever learn of her relationship with Applicant, she \nwould expect him to accelerate the divorce process with her.

(Tr. 107) Applicant last saw his French girlfriend in January 2022, and \nhas given her a key to his French apartment.  (Tr. 111) \nBetween March 2020 and June 2020, Applicant paid his French girlfriend \napproximately $11,252 in rent and other expenses to help her maintain her old Paris \napartment while she was making arrangements to transition to a new one. (Tr. 107-108) \nHe estimated his total monetary transfers to his girlfriend approximated $12,414, and \nwere made in exchange for his use of her old apartment while he was in France. (GE 2 \nand AE A; Tr. 52-54, 111-112) These funds were used by his French girlfriend for \nmultiple purposes. Applicant assured that he self-reported to his employer his friendship \nwith his French girlfriend and his wire transfers of his U.S. bank funds to British and \nFrench institutions to provide financial support to his girlfriend. (Tr. 52-53) Applicant \nassured, too, that he has never provided any general financial assistance to his French \ngirlfriend. (Tr. 55) \nAfter going to work for a private U.S. employer in March 2019, Applicant \nestablished a number of his investment accounts in French and English banking \norganizations. (GEs 1-2 and AE A; Tr. 59-61) Because he did not live or pay taxes in \nFrance, or have a business account with a French bank, French banking regulators \nrequired him to open a business account to pay the mortgage on any real estate \npurchase he planned, as well as a separate investment account, equal to 20% of the \nvalue of any mortgage he took out. (Tr. 61-62) Applicant, in turn, set up his French \nbusiness account. He set up this business account specifically to deposit funds to pay \nhis mortgage and related costs like insurance policies. (AE A; Tr.119-120) \nIn December 2020, Applicant purchased his own apartment in France. (GE 2 and \nAE A; Tr. 56, 112) To purchase the apartment, he obtained a loan from a French \nbanking institution in the amount of \u20ac700,000 ($842,730), at a rate of 1.38% for 20 \nyears. (AE A; Tr. Tr. 63) He supplemented these borrowed funds with his own saved \nfunds to purchase the apartment. He paid $800,000 to purchase his French apartment, \nwhich with the added of costs and fees of closing reached a total purchase amount of \n$1,106,679 (\u20ac908,156). (GE 2 and AE A) Applicant has no foreign bank accounts that \nare not related to the purchase of his French apartment. (AE A, Tr. 64) Further, he does \nnot use his French business account \u201cexcept for holding the mortgage,\u201d and the account \nearns no profits. (Tr. 66) \nDemand for French real estate from U.S and other foreign investors has \nincreased in recent years. French banks, however, have not been willing to finance \ndirect real estate purchases from non-French purchasers. (Tr. 62) As a result of French \nrestrictions on French real estate mortgages by non-French citizens, Applicant found it \nnecessary to create his own French company and use French bank accounts to \nfacilitate his purchase of his French apartment. To this end, he transferred $170,000 \nfrom his U.S. checking account in November 2020, and wired most of the funds in his \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. savings account (in excess of $149,000) to his opened British and French bank \naccounts. (GE 2 and AEs A-D)  \nWhen Applicant created a local French company, he utilized a French method for \nforeign purchasing of real estate in France to satisfy French lending requirements. (AE\nA; Tr. 61-62) He created this French company for the sole purpose of obtaining a\nmortgage on his purchased French apartment. This method involves setting up a local\nFrench company, called a Societe Civile Immobiliere or SCI for short. (AE A; Tr. 61-67)\nTo establish this French company, French regulations and lending practices required\nhim to use a French citizen to complete the paperwork for the creation of the SCI. (Tr.\n128) This SCI holds no funds or other assets not related to the financing of his French\napartment. (AE A; Tr. 64-66)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe French citizen who signed his purchase documents for his French apartment \npurchase was the same French counterpart that Applicant worked professionally with on \nNATO matters during Applicant\u2019s employment by his former U.S. intelligence agency. \nApplicant credited this French counterpart with never asking for any inappropriate \ninformation and being wholly trustworthy based on his professional experiences with \nhim. (Tr. 71) Applicant finds this French counterpart to be trustworthy and above \nreproach. so much so that he used this French contact to sign his purchase documents \nfor his French apartment purchase, when at the last minute his French lawyer could not \nsign the papers due to an acquired COVID-19 infection and he could find no other legal \nsources in France to sign the documents for him. (AE A; Tr. 127-129) \nThe act of signing Applicant\u2019s purchase documents by his French counterpart \nwas of a ministerial nature, and made necessary to satisfy French purchasing \nrequirements and did not signify any financial interest in the property by Applicant\u2019s \nFrench contact. Nothing covered in any of the documentation and hearing testimony is \nenough to support any drawn inference of a financial interest in Applicant\u2019s French \napartment by his French contact. \nCurrently, Applicant maintains an average balance of \u20ac50,000 in his French bank \nbusiness account for the funding of his French apartment purchase. (AE A; Tr. 120-122) \nTo satisfy French banking requirements, he also keeps \u20ac151,000 on hand in a French \nretirement account.

(Tr. 78-79, 132-33) In \neach exchange, Applicant had already retired from federal service. \nWhile Applicant considered the Italian offer to be an interesting and challenging \nprospect, he rejected the offer of employment out of concern it could cause him to lose \nhis security clearance. (GEs 1-2 and AE A) Applicant assured that he would never \n\u201cwillfully betray his country.\u201d (Tr. 80, 84) And, he assured he has no intention of \nacquiring dual citizenship in France, or changing his U.S. citizenship.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               Foreign Preference \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider he country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nprotected classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. See AG \u00b6 6. \nThe concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a country over the United States, then he or she may \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United states. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict \nwith U.S. national interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By \nitself, the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. See AG \u00b6 9. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

These overseas accounts he used to fund his planned purchase of a French \napartment, were in contemplation of his planned retirement in France. Additional \nsecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s post-retirement offer of a job with an \nItalian organization that Applicant declined. \nApplicant\u2019s long-term intimate relationship with a married French citizen to whom \nhe provided major financial assistance with wired funds from his U.S. bank accounts, \ncoupled with his use of wired funds from his U.S bank accounts to fund his planned \npurchase of a French apartment and his maintenance of close contacts with French \ncitizens, present initial security concerns raising heightened security risks covered by \nfour qualifying conditions.

Further, any \nretirement plans of Applicant to retire in France are still not fully formulated and will \npresumably be influenced by the business needs of his current employer (inclusive of \nthe potential needs of his of employer to have a NATO presence in France). \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate \nparticular outcomes for applicants with relationships and contacts with persons who are \ncitizens and residents of foreign countries in general. What is considered to be an \nacceptable risk in one country may not be in another. The geopolitical aims and policies \nof the particular country (in this case France) do matter. Summarized, the AGs do take \ninto account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the United States as an important \nconsideration in gauging whether the particular relative, friend, or contact with \ncitizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. France is one of \nthe United States\u2019 oldest allies and one in which the United States enjoys excellent \nbilateral relations. \nAlleged conflicts of interest are centered on Applicant\u2019s intimate relationship with \na married French citizen, his purchase of a French apartment with mortgage financing \nfrom a French banking institution with proxy assistance in the signing of Applicant\u2019s \npurchase papers from a long-time French NATO counterpart, his creation of French and \nBritish bank accounts to maintain large bank deposits, and his expressed intention to \nretire in France. All of Applicant\u2019s use of French banks to utilize banking payment \ndistributions through a French-created company (an SCI) he found necessary to create \nto meet French legal requirements reflect credible straight-forward business decisions \nreconcilable with U.S. and French banking laws and regulations. \nSince 2014, the U.S.\u2019s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) has \nimposed rigorous reporting requirements on foreign financial institutions of countries \nwith bilateral bank reporting agreements with the United States (France included). See \nPublic Law 111-147, 124 Stat 71 (March 2010), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471 (a-d) (2010). These \nimposed reporting obligations on French financial institutions have prompted French \nbanks to impose increased burdens on U.S. residents seeking to finance purchases of \nFrench real estate with French banking institutions. As a result, France and the vast \nmajority of Europe\u2019s banks now refuse credit requests from U.S. mortgage applicants, \nregardless of the asset and income levels of the prospective borrowers. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo minimize the risks of non-compliance with FATCA, French banks are now \nrefusing to respond to potential borrowers linked to the United States. See Mortgage \nUpdate: Can a U.S. Citizen get a Mortgage in France, in French Entre (August 2020). In \na post-pandemic world, French lenders can become very binary (linked as they are to \nagreed FATCA reporting requirements) in their handling of U.S. mortgage applications \nand impose all kinds of caveats and explanations for denying mortgage applications \nfrom U.S. citizens that collectively diminish the prospects of a U.S. citizen getting a \nFrench mortgage. \nTo avoid French legal challenges imposed on U.S. applicants seeking French \nmortgage financing, Applicant took advantage of legal options available to him under \nFrench law and achieved success in financing his French apartment purchase. Nothing \nin the French financing arrangements he chose conflicts in any discernible way with \nU.S. laws and regulations covering purchases of French property using legally available \nFrench financing instruments. Neither Applicant\u2019s French signatory of his purchase \npapers nor anyone not officially associated with his purchase and financing of his \nFrench apartment acquired any legal or equitable interest in his French apartment. \nMitigating conditions are available to Applicant as follows: MC \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe United States, \u201d 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d and 8(e), \u201cthe individual has \npromptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of \ncontacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign \ncountry.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his married French girlfriend and acquired property \ninterests in France with a stated intention of eventually retiring in France, while enough \nto raise initial security concerns, are surmounted by the absence of any evidence of (a) \nan actual or potential conflict of interest with his French connections (former \ncounterparts of Applicant during his past employment with his federal intelligence \nagency); (b) the absence of any actual or potential conflict of interest with U.S. security \ninterests associated with his established financial and personal interests in French \nproperty; (c) the status of France as a long-time ally of the United States that maintains \nclose and friendly geopolitical relations with the United States; and (d) the absence of \nany dual loyalties with France. \nForeign preference \nSecurity concerns are raised under Guideline C over Applicant\u2019s receipt of an \noffer of employment from an Italian civilian organization in July 2018 that he declined. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbsent evidence of any dual citizenship with France, assuming any type of employment, \nposition, or political office with the Italian government, or otherwise acting in a way that \nserves the interests of the Italian government in a way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests, Applicant\u2019s job offer alone (which he declined) is not enough to raise \nany preference concerns that are covered by any of the Guideline C disqualifying \nconditions. Raised foreign preference concerns by the Government are unsubstantiated \nbased on the facts developed in the record. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility requires \nconsideration of whether his personal connections with French citizens, proxies, and \nbanks, along with his property ownership in France and expressed interest in retiring to \nFrance, are compatible with his holding a U.S. security clearance. Favoring Applicant\u2019s \napplication to maintain his security clearance is the high regard in which he is held by \nformer agency managers, colleagues, and counterparts from France and Italy who \nworked closely with him and were in a good position to assess his judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. \nRaised security concerns over Applicant\u2019s intimate relationship with a still married \nFrench citizen, his close contacts with former French counterparts who currently \ninterface with each other on NATO issues, his use of French banks to finance his \npurchase of a French apartment, and his expressed intention to retire in France are \nmaterial to considerations of foreign influence that could potentially create a heightened \nrisk of pressure, influence, and compromise, but are not dispositive. \nImportant considerations for determining whether Applicant has mitigated the \nGovernment\u2019s foreign influence security concerns are (a) the close geopolitical relations \nthat have existed between France and the United States for over three centuries; (b) \nApplicant\u2019s distinguished record of handling the Government\u2019s most closely held \nclassified secrets over the course of his 39 years of uninterrupted federal service; and \n(c) his record of honesty and integrity that he has demonstrated with his managers and \ncolleagues (past and present). Applicant\u2019s contributions to the United States and NATO \nare continuing with his current employer and include his furnishing important expertise \nfor his employer\u2019s development of key cryptography certificates for application in high \nassurance devices for use across the globe. \nApplicant\u2019s defense contributions, weighed together with his mitigation efforts, \nare enough to overcome his foreign interest activities associated with his French \nconnections. While Applicant\u2019s French connections when evaluated piecemeal can be \nconcerning, they are reconcilable with Applicant\u2019s overall record of integrity, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability in his professional relationships with trusted friends and \ncounterparts over developed over a forty-year period of devoted service to the United \nStates and NATO.  I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), Exec.

After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. She has had a cohabitant since 2019 and does not have \nchildren. She earned her General Education Development diploma in 2007. She \ndisclosed in her March 2020 security clearance application (SCA) that she had worked \nfull time for a public safety center (PSC) since 2018. She previously worked for the PSC \nfrom April 2012 to September 2013 and from August 2011 to December 2011. She \ndisclosed that she also has worked full time for a federal contractor since February 2020. \n(Item 2) \nIn February 2018, Applicant was terminated from her employment as a 911 \ndispatcher for a city. She received written warnings for infractions such as in February \n2018 she used her work email to message a friend while on duty; in December 2017 she \nran the wrong tag number on a vehicle; in July 2015 she did not respond to an officer\u2019s \nradio traffic; and in February 2014 she did not start backup for a unit on a stolen vehicle. \nShe is not eligible for rehire. (Item 1) \nApplicant admitted that in February 2014 she did not start a backup unit for a stolen \nvehicle. She stated in her SOR answer that she ran the vehicle tags and used a computer-\naided dispatch system that she later learned is not as reliable. Another officer was on his \nway to the scene and was less than two minutes away. Applicant was later told by her \nsupervisor that she should have started to send another unit before she advised the officer \non scene that the vehicle was stolen. She stated that at the time she had only recently \nbeen released from training and she had not been in a situation or witnessed one where \nan officer was alone with a stolen vehicle. She said she never intentionally meant to put \nsomeone in harm\u2019s way and never repeated this conduct. (Item 1) \nIn July 2015, Applicant did not respond to an officer\u2019s radio traffic call. She \nexplained in her SOR answer that she did not hear the call come in over the radio. The \nrequesting officer indicated that he had repeated the request, but Applicant said she did \nnot hear him. Once she did hear him she responded.

(Item 1) \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant acknowledged she used her work email to message \nfamily and friends while on duty in dispatch. She stated that others in her unit, including \nthe supervisors, were also doing the same and were aware of this conduct. Cellphones \nhad been prohibited in the work area for several months and employees were using email \nto connect to people while at work. Applicant stated that she was never told that this \nconduct was prohibited until she was written up for it in February 2018. No other \nemployees were written up.

[Applicant] disregarded the information \nprovided and created an unsafe work-environment and declined confidence \nfor field responders. (Item 7) \nIn January 2019, while employed by PSC, Applicant opened a door she should not \nhave and an inmate attempted to escape. She received a written warning from PCS (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a). Applicant admitted in her SOR answer that her intention was not to allow the \ninmate to escape, but rather she opened the door as other officers with the inmate were \napproaching the door, and she assumed they were ready to leave the area with the \ninmate. She attempted to anticipate the officers\u2019 needs and acknowledged she was \nwrong. The inmate moved towards the door when he heard the lock open, but officers \nimmediately closed the door. When Applicant saw her supervisor she told him what had \nhappened and apologized. She also noted that she knew she was in trouble and accepted \nthe consequences. (Item 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had delinquent debts. Applicant admitted the debts \nand provided explanations.

(Items 1-6) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a ($220) and 2.b ($80) are owed to the same creditor. \nApplicant provided proof that she has resolved these debts.

Applicant was unable to \nmake the payments and the vehicle was repossessed. She said the vehicle was sold at \nauction and the deficiency was written-off. Her credit reports reflect a balance owed of \n$2,929. In her response to the FORM, Applicant provided a document to show she has \nmade a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay $50 a month to resolve the debt \nbeginning in February 2022. She anticipated being able to make payments of more than \n$50, but was advised that if she missed a payment the debt would be sent to collection. \nShe explained that she used Credit Karma to monitor her accounts and this account was \nnot listed under \u201cderogatory marks\u201d so she assumed it was closed even though it showed \na balance. Applicant is resolving the account. (Item 1, AE E) \nApplicant admitted the debt SOR \u00b6 2.e ($1,590) was on her credit report, but said \nshe had disputed it, and it no longer was on it. She disclosed a debt with this creditor on \nher SCA. In her FORM response, she acknowledged she held an account with the creditor \nbut was uncertain if the account alleged was the same because the amount owed differed. \nShe said when she disputed it, she believed the credit bureau would confirm the amount \nowed, but instead it removed it from her credit report. It is not listed on her January 2022 \ncredit report, but is listed on her August 2021 credit report, showing the date of her last \npayment as July 2014. The debt was likely removed due to its age. (Item 1) \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f ($493) and 2.g ($460) are medical debts that are \nreported on Applicant\u2019s March 2020 credit report. Applicant acknowledged during her \nbackground interview that the debts were for medical bills for an emergency room visit \nand a minor medical procedure that she could not pay. In her SOR answer, she stated \nshe disputed the accounts and they were removed from her credit report. They are not \nreported on her 2021 or 2022 credit reports. In her response to the FORM, Applicant \nstated these were debts for dental work, which is inconsistent with what she told the \ninvestigator. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.h ($363) is for a water bill. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, she \nsaid she disputed the bill and it was removed from her credit report. It is not listed on her \n2022 or 2021 credit reports, but is listed on her 2020 credit report. In her response to the \nFORM, she said she thought the bill should have been $70-100, and when she disputed \nit, they deleted it from her credit report. (AE E) \nApplicant stated in her response to the FORM that she regrets not managing her \nmoney better when she was younger. She did not realize it could be detrimental to her \nfuture. She has been working hard to clear her credit history and past financial mistakes. \nShe is now in a better financial position as she has received several raises and a \npromotion since working for the federal contractor. She has enough money to pay her \nexpenses. She does not have a car payment or outstanding medical bills.

(AE D, E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had eight delinquent debts that she was unable to pay for several years. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that she admitted were on her credit \nreport. She paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b and has a payment plan for the debt in \n\u00b6 2.d. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts. She did not begin to address the later debt until \nafter the SOR. She believed it was closed and she had no further responsibility. Applicant \nalso disputed the other debts alleged in the SOR. They are not reflected on her most \nrecent credit report. Applicant admitted she mismanaged her finances when she was \nyounger, but is now in a better financial position. She is able to pay her expenses and \nhas a payment plan for the largest debt that was on the SOR. She appears to now \nunderstand the importance of being financially responsible. I believe future financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur and her finances do not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that her financial issues were beyond \nher control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. She did not provide evidence that she has \nreceived financial counseling, but there are clear indications that her financial problems \nare under control.

AG \u00b6 20(e) has some application. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant received a written warning from her employer \nwhen she opened a door during an inmate transfer, which she admitted and provided an \nexplanation. She continues to work for this employer. She was also terminated from \nemployment in 2018 after she received written warnings in February 2018 (using email \nfor personal use); December 2017 (failing to run the correct tag number); July 2015 (not \nresponding to an officer\u2019s radio transmission); and February 2014 (not starting a backup \nunit for a stolen vehicle). She was not recommended for a security clearance by her 911 \nmanager. Applicant\u2019s use of email for personal use while she was working was in violation \nof the rules. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies to this conduct. \nI have reviewed all of the evidence and there is insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat the other conduct alleged in the SOR was intentional. The evidence supports that \nApplicant may have not done her job very well and made mistakes. The question is \nwhether this is the type of conduct contemplated by the personal conduct security \nconcerns. Not being good at your job is different than exercising questionable judgment, \nbeing untrustworthy or unreliable. It may be that she was not suited for the stresses of the \njob. I do not believe her infractions are the type contemplated under the personal conduct \nguideline. I find the disqualifying condition does not apply to those allegations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nwas infrequent, or it happened under unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nApplicant stated she was unaware at the time that using email for personal use \nwas prohibited. She acknowledged that she violated this rule and there is no evidence \nshe continued to use it after being advised. I find that the offense is minor and happened \nin 2018 and is unlikely to recur. It does not cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. Both of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Applicant had some difficulties when working for PCS, \nbut I do not believe the infractions raise personal conduct security concerns. I find she \nmitigated the minor rule violation under the personal conduct security concern. The record \nevidence does not leave me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.1-2.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

This allegation is found for Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had a plethora of past-due debts totaling about $48,000. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant can attribute his financial difficulties to a devastating flood he \nexperienced in 2014. However, in the intervening seven to eight years, he has \naddressed only about half of his admitted past-due indebtedness. Applicant still has \nover $27,000 in past-due debts he has yet to address. Financial Considerations is found \nagainst Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n    AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e. and 1.f: \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i: \nFor Applicant  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m. and 1.n: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of August 26, 2021, Applicant owed charged-off debts of $30,922 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $9,995 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $3,075 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $12,011 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and $31,487 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in June 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Under Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have used marijuana three times between June 2016 and September 2016 while he held access eligibility for classified information (SOR \u00b6 2.a). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted that he had owed the five alleged debts, which became delinquent because of his divorce and the failure of tenants, and that he had received a discharge of those debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy before the SOR was issued. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 37 years old and divorced. He served in the enlisted ranks of a branch of the United States military from June 2003 until April 2014. He achieved E-6 rank and was granted an honorable discharge. He took some classes at a community college from 2 January 2012 to December 2013. He has worked as a nuclear test engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor, since his discharge from the military in April 2014. He held a DOD security clearance at the level of secret from 2003 until it was suspended upon the issuance of the SOR. (GE 1; Tr. 24-25.)

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Gregg W. Wagman, Esq. \n07/26/2022 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nIn June 2021, Applicant was granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of $93,661 in \nnonpriority unsecured claims incurred during his short-lived marriage. He made no effort to \nattempt settlements with his creditors before filing for bankruptcy, but circumstances \noutside of his control compromised his finances. He wrongly used marijuana with his then \nwife on three occasions in the summer of 2016, while he held a Department of Defense \n(DOD) security clearance. He had a record of timely debt payments before he decided to \nresort to bankruptcy, and he intends no future illegal drug involvement. Clearance eligibility \nis granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 26, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The SOR explained why the DCSA \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \nOn September 3, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On November 30, 2021, the SOR was amended to add an allegation under \nGuideline F. Applicant admitted the allegation without comment on December 9, 2021. \nOn January 10, 2022, a DOHA Department Counsel indicated that the Government \nwas ready to proceed to a hearing. On February 2, 2022, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. I received the case file and assignment \non February 11, 2022. \nOn May 17, 2022, Counsel for Applicant entered his appearance. After some \ncoordination with the parties, on May 17, 2022, I scheduled Applicant\u2019s hearing for June 7, \n2022. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) and \nsix Applicant exhibits (AE A-F) were admitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant \nand two witnesses testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on June 23, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of August 26, 2021, Applicant owed \ncharged-off debts of $30,922 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $9,995 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $3,075 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \n$12,011 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and $31,487 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that Applicant received a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge in June 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Under Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to \nhave used marijuana three times between June 2016 and September 2016 while he held \naccess eligibility for classified information (SOR \u00b6 2.a). When Applicant answered the \nSOR, he admitted that he had owed the five alleged debts, which became delinquent \nbecause of his divorce and the failure of tenants, and that he had received a discharge of \nthose debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy before the SOR was issued. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 37 years old and divorced. He served in the enlisted ranks of a branch \nof the United States military from June 2003 until April 2014. He achieved E-6 rank and \nwas granted an honorable discharge.

He has worked as a nuclear test engineer for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since his discharge from the military in April 2014. He held \na DOD security clearance at the level of secret from 2003 until it was suspended upon the \nissuance of the SOR. (GE 1; Tr. 24-25.) His security clearance eligibility was last renewed \nin 2014 for his defense-contractor employment. (Tr. 45.) \nApplicant purchased a home in October 2010. He obtained a mortgage loan for \n$215,526 with initial repayment at $1,435 per month. (GE 2; AE E.) Available credit reports \nshow that he obtained a car loan in August 2010 for $34,613, which he paid off one year \nlater in a $30,737 lump sum. In May 2011, he obtained a car loan for $29,090 that he paid \noff in April 2013 in a $22,089 lump sum. (GE 3.) \nOn his marriage in October 2015, Applicant moved in with his ex-wife, who co-\nowned her home with her ex-husband. (Tr. 41.) Applicant kept his house as a rental \nproperty. His ex-wife\u2019s income as a registered nurse was comparable to his income. (Tr. \n27.) However, she had poor credit so the debts incurred during their marriage were in \nApplicant\u2019s name. (Tr. 42.) He made his debt payments on time. (AEs D-E.) \nAround January 2018, Applicant decided to divorce his ex-wife for her infidelity. \n(GEs 1, 5; Tr. 25.) He consulted with an attorney about a bankruptcy, and was advised to \nwait until his divorce was final. He had some sizeable debts but was making payments on \nthem. He was informed that if he was committed to filing for bankruptcy, he would not \nbenefit from making payments on his unsecured debts. (Tr. 48.) He and his attorney had \ndiscussed a possible Chapter 13, but Applicant preferred a Chapter 7 filing because he \n\u201cwould be out of it in a matter of months rather than a period of three to five years.\u201d He \nwanted to stabilize his life after his divorce sooner rather than later. (Tr. 50.) On the advice \nof the bankruptcy attorney, Applicant stopped paying on his unsecured debts, including a \nloan in his name (SOR \u00b6 1.a) for the car his ex-wife was driving. (Tr. 27, 36, 40.) He \ncontinued to make the payments on the mortgage for his property, in which he had tenants, \nand on his loan for a 2007 model-year car that he was driving. He had obtained the loan in \nOctober 2016 for $14,876. (GE 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s house was rented out, so on his marital separation in February 2018, \nApplicant moved into a one-bedroom apartment at rent of approximately $900 a month. \n(GE 1; Tr. 28, 49.) In March 2018, his tenants stopped paying the rent. He asserts that \n\u201cthere was zero chance that [he] would have been able to maintain those payments\u201d on his \nunsecured debts at that point. (Tr. 37.) He lost about $7,000 in rental income between \nMarch 2018 and August 2018 (GE 5), and fell behind in his mortgage payments over that \ntime. (GE 2; AEs C-D.) He paid his ex-wife $600 a month during the divorce proceedings \nfrom March 2018 to December 2018. (Tr. 49-50.) In August 2018, he succeeded in having \nhis tenants evicted. (GE 1; AE F; Tr. 28, 37-38.) Of the $1,064 in legal fees and \ndisbursements for the eviction proceeding, he had paid all but $89 as of August 21, 2018. \n(AE F.) By then, the accounts in the SOR had been charged off. (GE 2; AE D.) Applicant \nmade no efforts to try and settle any of the past-due debts.

(GE 1; AE B.) They \nshare custody of their daughter now age 5, and split the time spent with their daughter. (AE \nB, Tr. 30.) Applicant has paid $100 a week in child support since his divorce. (GE 5; Tr. \n36.) He has never been behind in his child support payments. (Tr. 48.) \nTo renew his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified as \naccurate a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on January 16, 2020. He \ndisclosed that he had used marijuana recreationally with his then wife on two or three \noccasions between June 2016 and September 2016 while he held a security clearance. He \ndenied any intention to use marijuana in the future, as he did not enjoy it and has since \nbeen divorced from his ex-wife whose drug use was a contributing factor. (GE 1.) \nIn response to SF 86 inquiries about any financial delinquency involving routine \naccounts, Applicant listed seven delinquent accounts: a $28,101 deficiency balance on a \nloan for a repossessed vehicle that his ex-wife retained after the divorce (SOR \u00b6 1.a); \n$3,060 on an unsecured loan obtained for home improvements (driveway repaving, Tr. 41) \nin collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c); three credit-card debts in collection for $9,996 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), \n$12,017 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $2,515 (not alleged in SOR); a $31,487 balance on a debt-\nconsolidation loan in collection (SOR \u00b61.e); and a $1,291 hospital bill in collection (not \nalleged). Applicant explained that he was unable to afford the payments on the accounts \nafter his marital separation as he had to establish a new household and provide for his \ndaughter. He expressed a plan to file for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with his tax refund for \n2019 and that he had been told by his lawyer to concentrate on remaining current on his \nmortgage loan and his car loan. (GE 1.) \nAs of May 12, 2020, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed that he was on time with his \nmonthly payments of $1,460 and $341 on his mortgage and car loans. He had not been \nlate on his mortgage since September 2018, and had never missed a car payment. As of \nApril 2020, the balances were $175,204 (mortgage) and $2,032 (car loan). He reportedly \nowed the following charged-off balances: $30,922 (SOR \u00b6 1.a, opened for $59,071 in \nOctober 2016, charged off for $18,646 in July 2018); $9,995 (SOR \u00b6 1.b, charged off in \nJuly 2018); $3,075 (SOR \u00b6 1.c, charged off in July 2018); and $12,011 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, \ncharged off for $12,016 in August 2018). His credit report reflected that a past-due balance \nof $31,487 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was charged off in June 2018. (GE 2.) Information gleaned from a \nMay 2022 credit report indicates that he obtained the loan for $40,000 in June 2016, so he \nhad paid down the loan until February 2018. (AEs C, E.) \nOn May 19, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he divorced his ex-wife for her \ninfidelity, and that he had no obligations in the divorce to his ex-wife apart from his child \nsupport. He retained those assets that he had brought into the marriage, including his \nhouse. He denied any use of marijuana beyond his brief experimentation with his ex-wife in \nthe summer of 2016. He held a DOD secret clearance at the time of his drug use and \nadmitted knowing that he was not authorized to use marijuana and should have reported it. \nApplicant acknowledged owing the delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e as well as the $1,291 \nmedical debt listed on his SF 86.

(GE 5.) The vehicle was \nrepossessed in May 2018. (Tr. 39.) \nApplicant explained to the OPM investigator that the credit-card accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.d were for household expenses and to repave his driveway. The debt-consolidation \nloan in SOR \u00b6 1.e was used to pay off some credit-card debts and for household \nexpenses. He attributed his financial issues to his divorce because he had to establish a \nnew residence for himself on their separation and also a tenant did not pay rent from \nMarch 2018 to August 2018. He lost about $7,000 in income and had to evict the tenant in \n2018. After consulting with a bankruptcy attorney, he decided to keep current on his \nmortgage and car loans needed to live, and he stopped paying on unnecessary accounts \nthat he could not afford to repay. Applicant expressed that he planned to resolve his \ndelinquent debts by filing for bankruptcy in the future when he had the money to pay a \nbankruptcy attorney. (GE 5.) \nApplicant retained his bankruptcy attorney on August 26, 2020, at a flat fee of \n$2,500. (GE 4; Tr. 29.) He asserts that he could not previously afford to retain a bankruptcy \nattorney because he had other legal fees stemming from his divorce and the eviction \nproceedings. (Tr. 29.) \nAs of November 3, 2020, Applicant was still current on his mortgage loan. In \nOctober 2020, he paid off the loan for his vehicle, a 2007 model-year car that he retained \nfollowing his divorce. (AE E.) He still has that car (Tr. 39), as well as a 2017 model-year \ntruck that he bought in October 2020 with a loan for $34,285, to be repaid at $633 per \nmonth for 72 months. (GEs 3-4.) That truck loan does not appear on his June 2022 credit \nreports (AEs D-E), but he listed the truck loan as a secured debt on his bankruptcy petition. \n(GE 4.) The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d were on his credit report as past-due balances with \nno progress toward repayment. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was not on his credit report. (GE 3.) \nAfter completing a debtor-education course required for a bankruptcy filing, \nApplicant filed a no-asset Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on March 8, 2021. (Tr. 30-31.) He \nlisted $93,661 in unsecured, nonpriority claims on nine accounts: the five accounts in the \nSOR; three medical debts of $328, $1,291, and $2,046; and a $2,542 credit-card debt. (GE \n4.) That credit card does not appear on the credit reports in evidence, so it is unclear when \nhe opened that account or whether it was delinquent as of his bankruptcy filing. He \nexempted his two secured claims (the truck and mortgage loans) from his bankruptcy and \nindicated that he intended to retain the properties and continue to make his payments. He \nreported wage income of $86,631 in 2019 and $100,353 in 2020, but also that his monthly \nexpenses exceeded his income by about $10.

The loss of Applicant\u2019s clearance impacted that work that the \nsupervisor could assign to him. Applicant has been careful since then to ensure that he \ndoes not work on classified matters.

These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Available credit reports show that Applicant \ndefaulted in 2018 on the five accounts listed in the SOR. He stopped paying on the debts \naround February 2018, as he had decided on a Chapter 7 bankruptcy as his fastest way to \nstabilize his finances after his divorce. He made no efforts to settle the debts with his \ncreditors, and as of May 2020, he owed about $87,490 on the charged-off accounts. \nApplicant\u2019s legal liability for repayment was discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ngranted in June 2021, Title 11 Section 525 of the United States Code, provides protection \nagainst discriminatory treatment for a debtor in bankruptcy with regard to granting or \ndenying employment or denying, revoking, suspending or refusing to renew a license, \npermit, charter, franchise, or other similar grant. Bankruptcy is a legal remedy and no \nadverse conclusions are to be drawn solely on the basis of a bankruptcy. At the same time, \nin the security clearance context, the federal government is still entitled to consider the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to \nsatisfy debts in a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, \n2015). The Appeal Board has held that the administrative judge is not precluded from \nconsidering whether the circumstances underlying a debt impugn an applicant\u2019s judgment \nor reliability. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-022-6 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015). This is so \neven with respect to debts that have been discharged in bankruptcy. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 15-02326 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016). An applicant\u2019s financial history and \ncircumstances are relevant in assessing his or her self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national interest as well as the vulnerabilities inherent in \nthe circumstances. The following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 have some \napplicability: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his loan and credit-card defaults. \nOne or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability in that Applicant\u2019s divorce, which had a negative \nimpact on his finances, is a circumstance that is unlikely to recur. The passage of four \nyears since the debts became delinquent and were charged off carries little weight in \nmitigation, given the debts were ignored and unresolved before his 2021 bankruptcy. An \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and are \nconsidered recent. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established in some aspects. Applicant filed for the divorce, knowing \nthat it would impact his financial situation, He had no control over his ex-wife\u2019s lack of \nfidelity to their marriage. While it appears that he had already decided to default on his \nunsecured debts, his tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent from March 2018 to August 2018 was \nanother circumstance outside of his control. He had no rental income with which to make \nthe mortgage payments on his property at a time when he had to pay for an apartment for \nhimself and had legal fees and disbursements totaling $1,064 for his tenant\u2019s eviction. He \nalso paid his ex-wife $600 a month from about February 2018 until their divorce was final in \nDecember 2018. \nFull mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that an individual act responsibly under his \nor her circumstances. One component of financial responsibility is to remain in contact with \none\u2019s creditors and attempt to negotiate resolution of debt balances. He admits he made \nno attempt to contact his creditors. He decided to file for bankruptcy in early 2018 and then \ndid not file his Chapter 7 petition until March 2021. While he asserts that he could not \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nafford to file before then, in part due to other legal fees for his divorce and eviction \nproceedings, he owed only $89 to the attorney who handled the eviction as of what \nappears to be the attorney\u2019s final billing in August 2018. He may well have had outstanding \nlegal fees for his divorce, but he provided no details in that regard. Moreover, available \ncredit reports show that shortly after he retained his bankruptcy attorney in August 2020, in \nOctober 2020, he obtained a truck loan for $34,285. He took on a $633 monthly payment \nobligation as his unsecured creditors went unpaid and he was planning a Chapter 7 filing. \nThese financial decisions, made in his self-interest, are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nA Chapter 7 discharge is not a good-faith effort to resolve debts under AG \u00b6 20(d) \n(\u201cthe individual is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts\u201d). See ISCR Case No.02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR \nCase No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). However, it is a legal means of debt \nresolution that warrants consideration of AG \u00b6 20(c). He had financial counseling through \nthe bankruptcy, which is required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c), and because his legal \nliability for repayment has been discharged, the debts are no longer a source of financial \npressure for Applicant. The salient issue becomes whether his financial situation is under \ncontrol to where he can be relied upon to meet his financial obligations on time in the future \nwhen his access to credit is adversely affected because of his bankruptcy. There is \nfavorable evidence in that regard in that Applicant had a track record of timely payments on \nhis debts before his marriage. He has never missed a child support payment. Apart from \nthe truck loan, which he was not asked about during his hearing, he has opened only one \nnew credit-card account since his divorce in 2018. He has been on time with his payments \non that account. The truck loan was a new loan as of his November 2020 credit report with \nEquifax (GE 3), and it does not appear on Applicant\u2019s May 2022 credit reports with Trans \nUnion (AE C) or Experian (AE D). He listed the truck as an asset to retain in his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, as he intended to continue to make payments on the debt. There is no \ndocumentation in evidence showing his payment history. He has a history of timely \npayments on other car loans, excluding the loan discharged in bankruptcy for the vehicle \nhis ex-wife retained in the divorce (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nApplicant did not show adherence to duty or obligation to his creditors by obtaining a \nbankruptcy discharge. Certainly, he would have had a stronger case in mitigation had he \ndemonstrated a track record of timely repayment of the SOR debts. However, his financial \nproblems were primarily caused by his divorce. He appears to be living within his means. \nThere is no evidence of recent financial overextension that would suggest his financial \nproblems are likely to reoccur. His financial situation does not currently raise security \nconcerns. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \n10 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that marijuana remains a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance under federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United \nStates Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; have no \ncurrently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety \nfor use of the drug under medical supervision. Section 844 under Title 21 of the United \nStates Code makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally possess a \ncontrolled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid prescription. On October 25, 2014, \nthe then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued guidance that changes to laws by \nsome states and the District of Columbia to legalize or decriminalize the recreational use of \nmarijuana do not alter existing federal law or the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, \nand that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture \nof marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. \nApplicant used marijuana recreationally with his ex-wife three times between June \n2016 and September 2016. He held a DOD secret clearance at the time and knew that \nmarijuana use was contrary to his clearance eligibility and defense-contractor employment. \nThe following two disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 apply: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply to his \nmarijuana use. The following mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 26 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, I note that he was a long-time security \nclearance holder while serving in the U.S. military. His clearance eligibility was last \nrenewed in 2014 for his defense-contractor employment. While the security clearance \napplication that he would have completed at that time is not in evidence, he clearly \nunderstood that by applying for renewal of his clearance, he promised to abide by federal \ndrug laws and DOD policy that prohibited the use of marijuana. In ISCR Case No. 16-\n03460, decided on May 24, 2018, the Appeal Board clearly stated: \nA person who broke a promise to abide by drug laws after having been \nplaced on notice that drug use is not compatible with access to classified \ninformation has not demonstrated the quantum of reliability expected of \nthose with access to classified information. \nIn light of that Appeal Board precedent, neither the limited extent of Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use nor the four years since his use, which are mitigating considerations under \nAG \u00b6 20(a), are alone enough to mitigate the security concerns. However, I am persuaded \nthat his drug use was situational and is not likely to recur. Although he has some contact \nwith his ex-wife because they share custody of their young daughter, the dissolution of their \nmarriage satisfies AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2). She was the source of his marijuana, and \nhe used it only with her. AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) applies in that Applicant, who reported his drug use \non his 2020 SF 86, does not intend to use any illegal drug, including marijuana, in the \nfuture. He admits that it was a lapse of judgment on his part, and he has not tried to excuse \nhis drug involvement. The drug involvement and substance abuse security concerns are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analyses under Guidelines F and H are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some \nwarrant additional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an\napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-92160 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems and drug use occurred during his marriage or as a result of \nhis marriage. His ex-wife had poor credit and used illegal drugs. At the same time, \nApplicant bears responsibility for the decisions that he made during his marriage, which \nincluded incurring debt in his name, and using marijuana. \n \nApplicant responsibly sought professional advice about his indebtedness when \nfaced with the prospect of going from a two income to one income household on filing for \ndivorce. By all accounts, he did not allow his issues at home, financial or marital, to \nadversely affect his work performance or his ability to handle classified information. His \nsupervisor attests that Applicant strictly complied with the procedures for handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. While his work performance, however laudable, does \nnot minimize the seriousness of his financial issues or of his marijuana use while holding a \nclearance, it weighs favorably as to whether he can be relied upon to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. After considering the circumstances, and mindful that clearance \ndecisions are not intended as punishment for past shortcomings, I find it clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

(Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On March 25, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing \nin Appendix A, the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines K and E.

On August 15, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals issued a Notice setting the hearing for September 12, 2022.

(HE 1B) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as rescheduled on October 21, 2022, in the vicinity of \nArlington, Virginia using the Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, and all proffered \nexhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. (Tr. 14-17; GE 1-GE 7) Applicant \ndid not offer any documents at her hearing. On October 31, 2022, DOHA received a copy \nof the transcript. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegation in \u00b6 2.c. (HE 3) \nShe denied the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, 2.a, and 2.b. She also \nprovided mitigating information. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a DOD contractor. (Tr. 6) She continuously \nworked for the DOD contractor, a large corporation, for 22 \u00bd years. (Tr. 8) She worked \nfor the DOD contractor as a laboratory technician, crane operator, uniform security officer, \nand industrial security officer.

(Tr. 6) In 1997, she earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in park and land management and criminal justice. (Tr. 7) She \nhonorably served in the Army from 1997 to 1998, and she received an early discharge \ndue to pregnancy. (Tr. 7, 19) After her discharge, she had a miscarriage.

(Tr. 7) \nHandling Protected Information and Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges in about July 2019, Applicant failed to have a security \nprofessional inspect the property she was moving out of the sensitive compartmented \ninformation facility (SCIF). \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter the counseling in March 2019 for failing to double wrap classified or sensitive \nmaterials, Applicant asked to be transferred out of industrial security to a laboratory and \nthen to a range to be a crane operator. (Tr. 27-28) She wanted to be transferred because \nthere was too much work and stress in industrial security. (Tr. 28) She retained her desk \nin the SCIF because the job as a crane operator was potentially temporary, and she may \nhave needed to return to her industrial security duties. (Tr. 32) \nA coworker reported Applicant\u2019s possession of two books which security officials \nbelieved might show a foreign influence connection to Russia. (Tr. 34) Applicant\u2019s desk \nin the SCIF had a book about a Russian espionage case from the World War II era that \na former security manager gave her and a 1980s book about translations from Russian \nto English that she received from a coworker. (Tr. 29-32; GE 4) Security officials said a \nbook about Russian spies and how to encrypt writing was found on Applicant\u2019s desk \nbetween March 2019 and April 2019. (GE 5 at 2) Concerns about the Russian connection \ncaused security to lock Applicant out of the SCIF. (Id.) Security officials alleged that she \ngained unauthorized access to the SCIF; she wiped her computer when she performed a \nmanual backup; and she removed two boxes and a five-gallon bucket containing property \nfrom the SCIF without security inspecting the boxes or bucket. (Tr. 38; GE 5 at 2) She \nwas asked to bring the items back, and she brought one box and explained the other \nitems were food storage. (Id.) \nApplicant said a person working in the SCIF told her to clear out her desk in the \nSCIF because she had moved to a different location. (Tr. 37; GE 2 at 19) On July 24, \n2019, she collected most of her personal items, such as papers and books, put the items \nin boxes, and moved them out of the SCIF. (Tr. 37; GE 2 at 20) She placed the items in \nher car. (Tr. 46) She said no one was in the SCIF when she removed her property. (Tr. \n46) She believed security personnel discovered she removed her items from the SCIF \nbecause it was on video. (Tr. 46) When Applicant was asked about removing her property \nfrom the SCIF, she admitted it. (Tr. 46) Eight days after she removed the property from \nthe SCIF, she said she returned the property for security\u2019s inspection. (Tr. 47; GE 2 at 10) \nThey did not find any prohibited items in the property she returned for inspection. (Tr. 47; \nGE 2 at 21)  \nApplicant was unaware of any regulation or rule requiring security to inspect items \nbeing removed from the SCIF; however, she admitted that two people were supposed to \ncheck furniture being removed from the SCIF and the items being removed when \nsomeone retired or was terminated. (Tr. 37-38, 44; GE 2 at 20) She denied that she \n\u201cpiggy-backed\u201d or followed another employee into the SCIF. (Tr. 37-38, 48-49) She said \nshe used her badge to gain access to the SCIF. (Tr. 38, 48-49) Two days after she \nretrieved her items from the SCIF, she went back to the SCIF to retrieve more of her \npersonal property, and her badge would not open the door. (Tr. 49) She was not told at \nthat point that she did not have access to the SCIF. (Tr. 49) She attempted to back up \nher desktop computer in the SCIF, and she was unable to do it. (Tr. 38) She said she \ncalled the help desk for assistance. (Tr. 38) She denied that she knew how to wipe her \ncomputer. (Tr. 40) She said there are cameras throughout the SCIF, and it would be \nstupid for her to do something inside the SCIF that was a security violation. (Tr. 41) \nApplicant believes two coworkers conspired against her and made up the allegations in \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.

(Tr. 24; GE 2 at 12; GE 7) Classified \nand sensitive papers are supposed to be placed inside one envelope, and that envelope \nis then placed inside another envelope. (Tr. 42) The party receiving the improperly \nwrapped packages promptly reported the rule violation. Applicant admitted she mailed \nboth packages, and she believes she was verbally counseled about both packages on \nthe same date. (Tr. 24-25) She frequently sent documents through the mail, and she knew \nhow to package classified and sensitive materials. (Tr. 42) She acknowledged she made \na mistake in her packaging of the materials. (Tr. 25) She was overworked, and she \nsuggested she was distracted and overlooked the correct packaging of the materials. (Tr. \n42-43) There was no compromise of classified information. (GE 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in about April 2013, Applicant failed to report her handling of \nmaterials for which she did not have access. Applicant\u2019s July 18, 2019 OPM PSI states \nshe \u201copened a package [she] was not cleared for\u201d; however, the contractor\u2019s record did \nnot confirm this security violation. (GE 2 at 12) In her SOR response, Applicant said she \nopened a package that did not have any markings, and she discovered she was not \ncleared for the material inside the package. She sealed the package; she placed it into \nthe safe; and she informed her supervisor. (SOR response) The package was returned \nto the sender. (Id.) She received a correction action memo (CAM) for the incident; \nhowever, she believes it was unfair because she had no way of knowing she was not \ncleared for the material until she opened the package. (Id.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges in September 2019, Applicant presented two classified program \nrefresher briefings to an employee who did not have access. For classified briefings, they \nread the same information to the employee, except the name of the program is different \nfor each program. (Tr. 43) Applicant said the incident occurred in 2013. In 2013, Applicant \nwas counseled either verbally or with a CAM for a security violation because she briefed \nsomeone on the wrong program. (Tr. 22-23; GE 2 at 12; GE 3; GE 6) There was no \nevidence that the improper briefing occurred in September 2019. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges in about July 2019, Applicant was debriefed from all access to \nthe building containing the SCIF because of the security violations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.e. Applicant said she was told that she was debriefed because her work in the SCIF \nwas not needed due to her transfer to work at a range in another location. (Tr. 34-35) In \nFebruary 2020, she learned she was debriefed at least in part because of the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nHandling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 articulates the security concern for handling protected information: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive\ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability\nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise\nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized\nequipment or medium; \n \n \n(d) inappropriate efforts to obtain or view protected information outside \none\u2019s need to know; \n(e) copying or modifying protected information in an unauthorized manner \ndesigned to conceal or remove classification or other document control \nmarkings; \n(f) viewing or downloading information from a secure system when the \ninformation is beyond the individual's need-to-know; \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement; and \n(i) failure to comply with rules or regulations that results in damage to the \nnational security, regardless of whether it was deliberate or negligent. \n \nIn July 2019, Applicant\u2019s access to the SCIF was blocked or suspended because \nsome materials were found on her desk, which security officials erroneously believed \nraised a Russia-related foreign-influence concern. Those Russia-related materials do not \nraise a valid concern that she is a Russian agent. She obtained access to the SCIF, wiped \nher hard drive on her computer, and removed two boxes and a five-gallon bucket of \nmaterials without having them inspected. SOR \u00b6 1.a is substantiated because she should \nnot have removed materials from the SCIF after her access was revoked unless she was \nescorted by a cleared person. AG \u00b6 34(g) is established by substantial evidence. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege, and Applicant admitted that in 2019 she improperly \nwrapped classified material for mailing on two occasions. AG \u00b6 34(g) is established by \nsubstantial evidence. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges in about April 2013, Applicant failed to report her handling of \nmaterials for which she did not have access. The only evidence of this allegation is the \nOPM PSI, and it does not say she failed to report the opening of a package for which she \nwas not cleared. Applicant said she opened an unmarked package, discovered she was \nnot cleared to access the information, and she reported the incident to her supervisor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is refuted. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges, and Applicant admitted that she improperly briefed someone \nabout a program. She said she should have verified that she had the correct program for \nthe briefing. SOR \u00b6 1.e indicates this rule violation occurred in 2019 and the evidence is \nthat it occurred in 2013. SOR \u00b6 1.e is substantiated. AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(a) and 34(g) apply to this \nviolation of the rules. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges, and Applicant admitted that she was debriefed from access to \nthe SCIF in July 2019 for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. There is no \nallegation in \u00b6 1.f that Applicant did anything that implicates any security concern. SOR \u00b6 \n1.f alleges an administrative action by security officials and not an improper or \ninappropriate action by Applicant. SOR \u00b6 1.f is refuted.      \nAG \u00b6 35 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant improperly briefed someone about a program in 2013. She ensured this \nmistake was not repeated. AG \u00b6 35(a) applies to this rule violation. SOR \u00b6 1.e is mitigated. \nApplicant improperly packaged two items for mailing in 2019. This rule violation \nwas inadvertent; the party receiving the mail promptly reported the improper packaging; \nthere is no evidence of compromise; and it does not suggest a pattern. AG \u00b6 35(d) applies \nto these two rule violations. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are mitigated. \nApplicant had the burden of proving that she properly accessed the SCIF after \nsecurity blocked her access. She did not provide any witness statements from security or \nher supervisor that she was unaware her access to the SCIF was blocked or terminated. \nShe said there are cameras in the SCIF, and she believed that is how her access was \ndiscovered. She said no one was in the SCIF when she was there removing her property. \nShe did not provide a statement from an impartial person who reviewed the videotape \nsupporting her description of how she obtained access to the SCIF. She did not meet her \nburden of proving she properly accessed the SCIF. The security record indicates she \nwiped her hard drive on her computer in the SCIF. Applicant denied that she wiped her \nhard drive, and she said she sought assistance from the help desk to back up her \ncomputer. She did not provide a statement from the information technology office \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupporting her claim that she sought help with backing up her hard drive and the erasure \nof the information on her hard drive was accidental. She failed to meet her burden of \nproof. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to accessing the SCIF, erasing the \nhard drive on her computer in the SCIF, and removing property from the SCIF. Handling \nprotected information security concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 includes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll of the security concerns alleged under Guideline E in the SOR are covered \nunder Guideline K. AG \u00b6 16(d) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s entry of the SCIF after she was blocked, erasure of the hard drive of \nthe computer in the SCIF, and removal of property from the SCIF are discussed in the \nprevious section. This information is damaging to her personal, professional, and \ncommunity standing. AG \u00b6 16(e) is established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant denied that she was aware \nthat her access to the SCIF was revoked. She denied that she wiped the hard drive of the \ncomputer in the SCIF. She said the property she removed from the SCIF was all personal \nproperty. See discussion in previous section. She did not take full responsibility for her \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactions. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\u201d \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines K and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a DOD contractor. She continuously worked \nfor her current employer, a large corporation, for 22 \u00bd years. She worked for the DOD \ncontractor as a laboratory technician, crane operator, uniform security officer, and \nindustrial security officer. She was an industrial security officer for 13 years from 2006 to \n2019. She held a security clearance for all of her employment with the DOD contractor, \nexcept for the last three years. In 1997, Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in park and \nland management and criminal justice. She honorably served in the Army from 1997 to \n1998. \nThe evidence against granting access to classified information is more persuasive. \nIn July 2019, Applicant\u2019s access to the SCIF was blocked; however, she accessed the \nSCIF without having an escort.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. For SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, she stated that she did not recall the dates of her marijuana use, and that she did not start using marijuana until she was in college. She also denied using marijuana while holding a sensitive position, or while granted access to classified information. For SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.c, she denied falsifying her SCAs, stating the dates in allegation \u00b6 1.a are wrong. However, she admits that she answered \u201cno\u201d to the relevant questions on her 2019 SCA. For the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.d, she denied the allegation, stating that the dates are inaccurate, she did not start using marijuana until college, and stopped well before receiving her current position. She stated that she did not purchase marijuana on or before her start date, or use marijuana while holding a clearance. (Item 3) Her explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old. She graduated from high school in May 2012, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2016. She started working for employer 1, her initial clearance sponsor, as an intern in 2016. She reported on her 2019 SCA that she was granted a clearance in July 2016. She left employer 1 after approximately four months to work in an uncleared position for employer 2.

On July 26, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse) and Guideline E (personal conduct).

When Applicant \nanswered the SOR on July 29, 2021, she requested a decision based on the \nadministrative (written) record, without a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDepartment of Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn November 9, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 7. The \nSOR and the Answer (Items 1, 3) are the pleadings in the case. Item 2 is a procedural \ndocument. Items 4 and 5 are Applicant\u2019s SCAs, submitted in April 2016 and September \n2019, respectively. Item 6 is Applicant\u2019s November 2020 response to interrogatories. \nItem 7 is a summary of clearance status from DOD\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication \nSystem (JPAS). \nThe FORM was mailed to Applicant on November 9, 2021. She was afforded an \nopportunity to note objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, and was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to do so. She signed for \nher receipt of the FORM on November 18, 2021. No subsequent response from \nApplicant was received by DOHA, and the case was assigned to me on February 9, \n2022. Since Applicant did not respond to the FORM, she did not submit any evidence \nafter submitting the Answer to the SOR, nor did she offer any objection to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. Items 4 through 7 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn her Answer, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. For SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, \nshe stated that she did not recall the dates of her marijuana use, and that she did not \nstart using marijuana until she was in college. She also denied using marijuana while \nholding a sensitive position, or while granted access to classified information. For SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.c, she denied falsifying her SCAs, stating the dates in allegation \u00b6 1.a are \nwrong. However, she admits that she answered \u201cno\u201d to the relevant questions on her \n2019 SCA. For the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.d, she denied the allegation, stating that \nthe dates are inaccurate, she did not start using marijuana until college, and stopped \nwell before receiving her current position. She stated that she did not purchase \nmarijuana on or before her start date, or use marijuana while holding a clearance. (Item \n3) \nHer explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old. She graduated from high school in May 2012, and \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2016. She started working for employer 1, her initial \nclearance sponsor, as an intern in 2016.

She was granted an interim clearance in November \n2019. (Items 4, 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant disclosed on her 2016 SCA that she used marijuana from February \n2012 to June 2014. She reported that she used it occasionally on the weekends. She \nstated in this SCA that \u201cIt was just for fun as a college student. I am an adult now and \ndo not wish to consume such drugs.\u201d On her 2019 SCA, however, she answered \u201cno\u201d \nwhen asked: if in the last seven years: she illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances, or was involved in the illegal purchase of any drugs or controlled \nsubstances. (Items 4, 5) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on or about December \n12, 2019. She verified the accuracy of this interview in her November 10, 2020 \ninterrogatory response. In this interview, she disclosed that she had been smoking \nmarijuana recreationally, alone and with friends in social settings, starting in August \n2012. In college she used marijuana daily during her freshman year (2012-2013), but \nabstained in her sophomore year (2013-2014). During her junior year (2014-2015), she \nused marijuana about five times a month, and every weekend in her senior year (2015-\n2016). She admitted purchasing marijuana a couple times a month while in college. This \ntimeline of marijuana use ends two years later than she reported on her 2016 SCA. \n(Item 6) \nUpon graduation in May 2016, Applicant stopped using marijuana for four months \nwhile employed on a government contract, from about May 2016 to August 2016. She \nestimated that she smoked marijuana at least monthly between August 2016 and \nDecember 2019. She also self-medicated with marijuana to treat some medical \nsymptoms and conditions. She reported her last use was five days prior to her interview \nwith the government investigator. She held an interim clearance during this instance of \nmarijuana use. She has never had any drug counseling or treatment. (Item 6) \nIn her interview, Applicant told the investigator that she did not report her \nmarijuana use on her 2019 SCA because she was scared of being denied a clearance. \nShe said that she intentionally answered \u201cno\u201d to hide her marijuana use. She decided to \ndiscuss it in her interview, because she stated she wanted to be truthful, and knew it \nmight come up in the investigation. She stated that she had not thought about stopping \nher marijuana use, and did not want to be in pain. She then said that she does not want \nher marijuana use to have a negative impact on her employment, so she intends to stop \nusing marijuana. (Item 6) \nIn a handwritten narrative statement included with her November 10, 2020 \ninterrogatory response, Applicant stated that she is getting therapy and medication for \nher medical symptoms and conditions. However, she did not provide any corroborating \ndocumentation. She affirmed the accuracy of her interview summary regarding her drug \nuse, but said that she has not used marijuana since December 2019. She stated that \nshe does not intend to use marijuana in the future.

She did \nnot provide any explanation about why she verified the accuracy of her drug use in her \nNovember 2020 interrogatory response, but denied it in her July 2021 SOR Answer. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including\u2026 purchase; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nApplicant acknowledged on her 2016 SCA that she used marijuana between \n2012 and 2014.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \n25(c), and 25(f) apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency, to include \nmonthly, from 2012 to December 2019. Her involvement with marijuana is frequent and \nrecent. The record shows that she has temporarily stopped using marijuana, and \nrestarted several times in the past. Further, her most recent period of use occurred after \nshe submitted not one but two SCAs, in 2016 and 2019, and while granted access to \nclassified information. She did not provide sufficient evidence showing that her \nmarijuana use occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, or that she is \ncurrently abstaining. She provided no evidence that she has disassociated from her \ndrug-using friends and contacts, or avoids social situations where there is recreational \ndrug use. Furthermore, the finding (below) that she falsified her 2016 and 2019 SCAs, \nundercuts the credibility of her assertions of abstinence or changed circumstances \nmade in her interrogatory response. Her long history of illegal marijuana use continues \nto cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect \nto her eligibility for a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

She reported on Item 4 that she used and \npurchased marijuana between 2012 and 2014. She later told the investigator in her \nDecember 2019 background interview that she used marijuana several times a month \nduring her junior year (2014-2015), and every weekend in her senior year (2015-2016). \nIn deliberately underreporting her college-era marijuana use, she deliberately falsified \nher 2016 SCA, and AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c are also established. Applicant did not disclose any illegal \nuse or purchase of marijuana in the previous seven years on her September 2019 SCA. \nShe later admitted to a government investigator that she had purchased marijuana \nmonthly, and used marijuana until at least December 2019. Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator that she falsified her 2019 SCA because she wanted to hide \nher marijuana use, and did not want her SCA to be denied. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d is a cross-allegation of Applicant\u2019s Guideline H allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.d, discussed above). Since those allegations are established as unmitigated \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, it cannot be said that those allegations are \u201cnot \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\u201d as required \nunder AG \u00b6 16(c), so that disqualifying condition does not apply. However, Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of involvement with marijuana satisfies the general concern of AG \u00b6 15, given \nthe questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that \nher conduct shows. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant deliberately underreported her college-era marijuana use on her 2016 \nSCA and deliberately failed to disclose any drug use at all on her 2019 SCA, whether in \ncollege or afterwards. She admitted that she hid her involvement with marijuana on her \n2019 SCA because she did not want her application for a clearance to be denied. She \nused marijuana frequently, recently, and after submitting two SCAs. Neither AG \u00b6 17(a) \nor 17(c) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nIn this case, Applicant offered little whole-person evidence to consider. She \nprovided no documentary evidence in her Answer to support her claims that she is \nabstaining from marijuana, or is using alternative means to treat her medical symptoms \nand conditions.

In her interrogatory response, she wrote that \nthe interview report is correct about her recreational drug use. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns of \nher history of illegal marijuana use and purchase, and her marijuana use while granted \naccess to classified information, and while holding a sensitive position. All of this \ncontinues to cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with \nrespect to her eligibility for a security clearance. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 30, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations. I have incorporated those admissions into my findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. He has a high school diploma and two years of \ntechnical school. He has been married four times (to wife 1 (W1): 1995-2014; W2: 2015-\n2016; W3: 2017-2021; W4: 2021 to present). He has two children and two stepchildren. \nHe has worked for a defense contractor as a database administrator since June 2019. \nHe served in the U.S. Army for two years and received an honorable discharge due to \nmedical reasons. He has never held a security clearance. He completed his security \nclearance application (SCA) in July 2019. (Tr. 6, 15-18; GE 1)   \nThe SOR alleged Applicant: purchased marijuana from December 2018 to about \nMay 2019; used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 2012 to May 2019; used \nmushrooms in December 2018; and used ecstasy in August 2018. (See SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - \n1.d.) \nApplicant credibly testified that his marijuana use was very limited. When he was \n17 years old, his first exposure to marijuana was when a girl blew marijuana smoke in \nhis face. He did not ask her to do it at the time. His only other uses of marijuana were in \napproximately 2017 when he inhaled it from an e-pen (device used for smoking \nmarijuana), inhaled it from a joint, ate a pastry laced with marijuana, and ate marijuana \ngummy bears on two occasions. All these uses occurred in 2017, when he was living \nwith W3 and used it at her urging. They also occurred when they lived in a state which \nlegalized marijuana use under state law. At the time of these uses, Applicant did not \nhave a security clearance, or any affiliation with a defense contractor. He has not used \nmarijuana since beginning to work for his current employer. He voluntarily disclosed his \nmarijuana use to a defense investigator when interviewed in September 2019. (Tr. 20-\n23; GE 2) \nApplicant credibly testified that he purchased marijuana from December 2018 to \nMay 2019 as gifts to W3. She is approximately 12 years younger than Applicant and \nwas very involved in using marijuana. He was trying to make her happy and believed \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat his purchases of marijuana as gifts might help that cause. His purchases were \nmade at state-legalized marijuana dispensaries. Applicant and W3 separated in August \n2019. He has not purchased marijuana since their separation and has no intention to do \nso. He has no further contact with her other than to pay spousal support from the \ndivorce. He provided a signed sworn statement indicating his intent not to use or \npossess illegal drugs in the future (he understands marijuana is illegal under federal \nlaw) when he completed interrogatories sent to him by DOHA. (Tr. 18-19, 25, 28; GE 2) \nWhen completing the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant also disclosed his one-\ntime use of psychedelic mushrooms (December 2018) and ecstasy (August 2018). He \ntestified that he used these drugs while on vacation and on his birthday when he was \nwith W3. He has not used them since and has no intention to do so. He did not hold a \nsecurity clearance nor work for a defense contractor at the time of these uses. (Tr. 26-\n27; GE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana on several occasions from 2017 to \n2019. He also used illegal mushrooms and ecstasy one time each in 2018. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

He used mushrooms and ecstasy one time each in 2018. He purchased \nmarijuana in state-legalized dispensaries as gifts for W3 on several occasions between \n2017 and 2019. He is divorced from W3 and does not associate with her. He has \ncredibly expressed his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. He voluntarily self-\nreported all of his drug activities to the Government. He has not been involved with any \ndrug activity since 2019. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. His three years of abstinence and his \ndistancing from his drug-associated ex-wife are sufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s \nintent not to use in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and circumstances of the conduct; (2)the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production \nand distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive \nposition are prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, \nbut not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior raises a security \nconcern that has not been mitigated. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s limited drug \nactivity, his distancing from his drug-using ex-wife, and his three years of drug \nabstinence. I also considered Applicant\u2019s statement of intent not to use drugs in the \nfuture. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant did not pay all of the court-ordered child support for her children, \nresulting in arrearages of more than $50,000. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant was na\u00efve when she signed the custody documents for her divorce \nmore than 21 years ago. She lost a job in 2010; she had health issues; and she went \nthrough years of unemployment and underemployment. She contacted the department \nthat handled her child support payments, and she paid $10 per month. Her oldest child \nturned 18 about 16 years ago, and her youngest child about 8 years ago, but she was \nstill paying the arrearages through garnishment until her ex-husband passed away and \nthe court closed the case.

Security concerns about her \nfinances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(HE \n3)   \nOn April 30, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed, and on November \n19, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On January 6, 2022, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for February \n10, 2022. The hearing was held as scheduled using Microsoft Teams video \nteleconference. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 10, 13-15; GE 1-7) On February 18, 2022, DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing. On February 23, 2022, Applicant provided one exhibit, which \nwas admitted without objection. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) The record closed on February \n24, 2022. (Tr. 41) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 2.a, 2.b, \n2.c, and 2.d. (HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating \nand mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old database analyst working for a defense contractor. (Tr. \n5, 36; GE 1) He orders repair parts and supplies using a computer. (Tr. 36) In 2010, he \ngraduated from high school, and he attended college for less than one semester.

(Tr. 8)   \nFinancial Considerations \nIn January 2018, Applicant\u2019s pay was reduced because of a reduction in rank to \npetty officer third class from a proceeding under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ). (Tr. 22) He was unemployed for about three months after he was \ndischarged from the Navy in March 2018. (Tr. 21) He was underemployed after leaving \nthe Navy. (Tr. 26) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege three charged-off debts owed to the same credit \nunion for $15,988, $10,459, and $4,252. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege two charged-off debts \nowed to a bank for $3,422 and $377.

(Tr. 26; SOR \nresponse at 16) DRP told Applicant that they could settle his debts for 50 percent of the \nface amount of his debts. (Tr. 27) He made the agreed upon $524 monthly payments \nunder the DRP. (Tr. 28; SOR response at 17-64) He paid all of the SOR debts except the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $16,588. (Tr. 29-33; AE A at 5) He anticipates the last debt will be \npaid in 2022; however, it is unclear precisely when the debt will be paid under his payment \nplan. (Tr. 33; AE A at 5) The DRP indicates the debt is $8,292, and it is in the process of \nbeing paid. (Id.) A settlement agreement from the creditor was not provided. \nApplicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS) after his hearing \nshowing his monthly income was $4,120; his primary payment was monthly alimony of \n$1,019; and his monthly net remainder was $184. (AE A at 1-3) He did not include a \npayment to DRP in his PFS. Based on his general confusion during the hearing, he may \nnot have understood how to properly complete the PFS. \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 3.a allege that Applicant was arrested in about December \n2011 for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and underage consumption of alcohol. (GE 2 at \n5) His blood alcohol content (BAC) from a breathalyzer test was .13. (GE 2 at 5) He was \nfound guilty of DWI, and received a suspended jail sentence with two years of probation, \nand a $500 fine. (Id.) He completed a two-day Navy Substance Abuse Rehabilitation \nProgram (SARP) alcohol-impact class. (Id.) In January 2012, his commanding officer \nimposed nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for drunk driving, in violation of Article 111, UCMJ, \nfor the December 2011 DWI, and he was reduced from E-2 to E-1, received forfeitures of \nhalf of one month\u2019s pay for two months, and restriction for 45 days. (Id.) See Tr. 18.   \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 3.a allege Applicant was arrested in about October 2017 for \nDWI, and reckless driving (speeding). His BAC was .11. (GE 6) He was convicted of DWI, \nand his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. (GE 1) The court sentenced him to \n365 days in jail (suspended for two years), and he received a $250 fine. (GE 1) His \ncommanding officer imposed NJP for the October 2017 drunk driving offense, in violation \nof Article 111, UCMJ. (GE 6) In November 2017, his commanding officer imposed a \nreduction from petty officer first class to petty officer second class and 30 days of extra \nduty as well as forfeiture of one half of one month\u2019s pay for two months (suspended). (GE \n2 at 2) He received an alcohol evaluation from the Navy SARP, which determined he did \nnot need to attend alcohol-related classes, counseling, or treatment. (Id.) See Tr. 19-20. \nApplicant rarely consumes alcohol, and when he does, he limits his consumption \nto two drinks. (Tr. 23-25) He does not believe he has a problem with alcohol consumption. \n(Tr. 25) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 4.a alleges that in response to the question on his March 18, 2020 SCA \nabout the type of discharge he received, Applicant wrote \u201cHonorable.\u201d (GE 1 at 25) His \ndischarge was actually general under honorable conditions.

(Tr. 34) \nHe did not intend to deceive security officials with his answer on his SCA. (Tr. 34) \nSOR \u00b6 4.b alleges that on May 12, 2020, Applicant responded to questions from \nan Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator about his discharge. It alleged \nthat he falsely stated that he served out his contract, and he was not discharged for \nmisconduct. Actually, Applicant received an administrative discharge after having a \nhearing. (Tr. 21) He said he misunderstood what the OPM investigator was asking him, \nand he intended to accurately convey the processing of his discharge during the interview. \n(Tr. 35) \nSOR \u00b6 4.c alleges that Applicant\u2019s March 18, 2020 SCA asked whether he had \never been charged with an offense involving alcohol, and he failed to disclosed his DWI \ncharges in 2011 and 2017. Applicant disclosed his 2017 DWI arrest, and sentence in \ncivilian court on his SCA. (GE 1 at 38-39) On May 12, 2020, Applicant told an OPM \ninvestigator that he failed to disclose his 2011 DWI charge on his SCA because he failed \nto carefully read the question, and he believed he only had to disclose charges in the \nprevious seven years. (GE 2 at 5). He did not intend to deceive anyone with his answers \nabout his DWIs. (Tr. 35) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant received the following Navy ribbons and medals: National Defense \nService Medal; Navy \u201cE\u201d Ribbon (2); Navy Good Conduct Medal (2); Inherent Resolve \nCampaign Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; and Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon. (GE 7) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption or responsible alcohol \nconsumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case \nNo. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial \nof security clearance for Applicant with alcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior \nto hearing). For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the \nAppeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat \nApplicant continued to drink even after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the \nJudge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, \nsix years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious.

The extent to which security \nconcerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question \nthat must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. \nId. at 3 (citing ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2019) (reversing grant \nof security clearance for applicant with three alcohol-related driving incidents with most \nrecent occurring in 2017)). \nI have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. He reduced his alcohol \nconsumption after his 2017 DWI. He completed Navy SATOP, after which he did not \nreceive a diagnosis or recommendation to cease his alcohol consumption. He did not \nreceive a recommendation that he participation in a more intensive alcohol-rehabilitation \nprogram. He currently drinks alcohol at a responsible level and limits his alcohol \nconsumption to two drinks. There have not been any subsequent alcohol-related incidents \ninvolving the police and courts after 2017. Enough time has elapsed without alcohol-\nrelated problems to enable a reasonable predictive judgment that his maladaptive use of \nalcohol is safely in the past. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies. His history of alcohol consumption does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Alcohol consumption \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness\u201d; and \u201c(b) evidence \n(including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nApplicant committed DWI offenses in 2011 and 2017, and underage alcohol \nconsumption in 2011. These misdemeanor-level offenses are serious in that they entailed \na risk of death, bodily injury, and property damage to Applicant and other drivers. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a) and 31(b) are established. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nCriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated for the same reasons they are \nmitigated under the Alcohol Consumption Guideline, supra. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was not candid in his answers on his SCA about his \nhonorable discharge from the Navy and his 2011 DWI. He credibly stated at the time he \nanswered the questions, he believed his general discharge under honorable conditions \nmet the criteria for an honorable discharge. He also believed he only needed to disclose \nhis 2017 DWI because the 2011 DWI was more than seven years before he completed \nhis SCA. He tried to explain the circumstances of his discharge from the Navy to the OPM \ninvestigator. Applicant has difficulty explaining some concepts and procedures. I do not \nbelieve he intended to deceive security officials with his answers on his SCA or the OPM \ninvestigator during his interview. Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old database analyst working for a defense contractor.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 55-year-old systems engineer and production and design manager for a government contractor, employed since October 2018. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2017. He has three adult children (ages 25, 24, 21). He has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax year 2017, totaling about $30,058 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); and a delinquent tax debt owed to state \u201cA,\u201d totaling about $3,900 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The amended SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax year 2016, totaling $18,295 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that Applicant failed to timely file his annual Federal income tax returns as required for tax years 2016 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d (Ans. 1), and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c (Ans. 2). In regard to SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant replied that the correct total owed for 2016 Federal taxes is $9,000, and that he is on a payment plan. (Ans. 2) He also provided documents with his answers. Applicant owned a shipyard from about 1998 to 2012. He grew the business to 65 employees, and testified that it was reasonably profitable.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 26, 2018. \nOn March 23, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 11, 2021 (Ans. 1), and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel (DC) amended the SOR on \nNovember 18, 2021, to add two new allegations. Applicant answered the amended SOR \n(Ans. 2) on December 30, 2021.

The hearing was held via video \nteleconference, as scheduled. During the hearing, DC moved to again amend the SOR \nbased on Applicant\u2019s answers to the amended SOR from 2021. Applicant objected, and \nthe motion was denied. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were \nadmitted without objection. (Note: Applicant\u2019s forwarding email mistakenly labeled AE A \nas an IRS refund applicable to the 2021 tax year; rather the document relates to the 2019 \ntax year refund.) The record was held open until May 31, 2022, to permit the parties to \nsubmit additional documentary evidence. DC submitted additional exhibits AE 10 through \n15, which were admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections, and supplemented his closing \nargument. Applicant submitted additional exhibits, collectively marked as AE C, which \nwere admitted without objection, and supplemented his closing argument. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on May 31, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old systems engineer and production and design manager \nfor a government contractor, employed since October 2018. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1989. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2017. He has three adult children \n(ages 25, 24, 21). He has never held a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes for tax year 2017, totaling about $30,058 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); \nand a delinquent tax debt owed to state \u201cA,\u201d totaling about $3,900 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The \namended SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for \ndelinquent taxes for tax year 2016, totaling $18,295 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that Applicant failed \nto timely file his annual Federal income tax returns as required for tax years 2016 through \n2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d (Ans. 1), and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.c (Ans. 2). In regard to SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant replied that the correct total owed \nfor 2016 Federal taxes is $9,000, and that he is on a payment plan. (Ans. 2) He also \nprovided documents with his answers.  \nApplicant owned a shipyard from about 1998 to 2012. He grew the business to 65 \nemployees, and testified that it was reasonably profitable. He testified that in 2011, he \nagreed to build two large crew boats costing $7 million per boat.1 Despite his cost \nestimates, the company lost money on the project. (Tr. 11-12) \nIn 2009, he filed Chapter 11 \u201creorganization\u201d bankruptcy (Case No. 09-5***3). The \nbusiness claimed $3,634,797 in liabilities and $1,588,050 in assets. (AE C) In October \n1 Applicant testified that the boat contract loss was in 2011 after which he filed bankruptcy, but his \ncompany\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy was filed in 2009 and the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed in 2010. His \npersonal Chapter 13 bankruptcy was filed in 2009.

On June 16, 2010, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge \ngranted the motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 as of May 25, 2010. (GE 12) A final decree \ndischarging the trustee in the Chapter 11 case was granted in July 30, 2010. (GE 12) \nIn October 2010, Applicant\u2019s company filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Case No. 10\u00ad\n5***8), on estimated liabilities of $2,372,589 and assets of $56,151. The Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy included claims from 15 creditors, including the IRS for approximately \n$142,932, for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties for Federal Social Security, \nunemployment, and corporate income taxes in tax years 2008 and 2009. (GE 15) The \nChapter 7 bankruptcy was discharged in August 2012. (GE 14) In his supplemental \nclosing argument, he stated that \u201call taxes that were owed by [boat company], that were \nin the form of payroll taxes were paid.\u201d He claimed in argument that his company \naccountant stopped paying $300,000 in payroll taxes after he lost oversight control from \nanother accountant. No independent documentation supporting this claim was submitted. \nApplicant filed personal Chapter 13 bankruptcy (Case No. 09-5***6) in 2009 on the \nadvice of counsel to shield him from claims of the boat company\u2019s creditors. He completed \nthe Chapter 13 plan by October 2010, and it was discharged. He claimed $257,344 in \nliabilities and $472,520 in assets. (AE C) A total of 45 creditors made claims, including \nthe IRS who claimed approximately $345,203 in taxes owed; the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration who claimed approximately $29,808 owed; and his state Department of \nRevenue who claimed approximately $104,704 in taxes owed. The IRS claim included \ndebts for unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties for Federal Social Security, unemployment, \nand corporate income taxes in tax years 2008 and 2009. (GE 13) \nIn 2011, Applicant started a small boat building business, incorporated as a limited \nliability company (LLC). He testified that the business has been recently unprofitable. \nFrom 2009 to 2012, Applicant worked for a marine consulting company before he was \nlaid off. In 2017, he decided to become self-employed and to use a $450,000 builders \nloan and $250,000 cash (including taking an early withdrawal of $200,000 from his \nretirement account with penalties) to build a speculative (spec) home with the intent to \nsell when completed. He completed the home in 2017, and but could not sell it until 2019 \nbecause it was overpriced. (Tr. 13) It sold for $650,000, well below what he expected to \nmake. He claimed he lost $75,000 on the sale of the home and $200,000 in other costs \nas a result of the spec home project. (Tr. 41-47) From January to October 2018, Applicant \nworked for another engineering company, before accepting his current position with a \ndefense contractor in October 2018. (GE 1) \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns as required for tax years 2016 \nto 2018. The 2016 Federal income tax return was originally filed late; in November 2017; \nand the 2017 and 2018 returns were filed late; in December 2019. No extensions were \nrequested. (GE 5) He failed to pay income taxes due for tax years 2016 and 2017. As of \nDecember 2020, he owed $47,317 in delinquent Federal taxes and about $5,200 in \ndelinquent state taxes.

Applicant admitted his outstanding Federal tax liability, but as a result of \nthe application of subsequent tax year refunds to his balance, and a payment plan he \nstarted in December 2020 and ended in May 2022, he has paid off the Federal tax \nbalance. Part of his 2020 Federal tax refund was applied to his 2017 tax debt. (GEs 4 and \n5) He stated in testimony:  \nAnd, you know, the taxes \u2013 I sort of shoved them to the back. And I focused \non my children. And I did. Should I have filed them? Yes. I could have \u2013 I \ncould have eliminated some not-to-file penalties \u2013 did-not-file penalties. \nThat was definitely a mistake. Did I have the money to pay it? I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t \nhave the cash to pay it. I was doing my best to support my kids, but I could \nhave gotten rid of the penalties. (Tr. 14) \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also filed his 2017 state income tax \nreturn late (in January 2020) (GE 2), and his 2018 and 2019 state tax returns late (in \nDecember 2021). (GE 2; Ans. 2) Applicant originally owed a $3,900 to the state for tax \nyears 2016 to 2020, but he filed amended Federal income tax returns that changed his \nstate obligation. As of January 2022, the state notified him that alleged debts for tax years \n2016-2019 were canceled based on information he provided them. (Ans. 2; Tr. 65-66) \nApplicant also failed to file his 2019 and 2020 Federal income tax returns when due (2019 \nfiled in December 2020; 2020 filed in about August 2021). All state and Federal income \ntax returns have now been filed, and some have been recently amended. (Tr. 55-60; Ans. \n2; GEs 2-9) \nApplicant has not sought financial counseling, except as required by the court \nbefore filing bankruptcy. He blamed a dishonest accountant for his company\u2019s failure to \npay business taxes when due, and his own reluctance to use an accountant to file his \npersonal taxes, for much of his troubles. He expressed regret for his past financial \nsituation and attributed them to his failed business, overextension because of his spec \nhome, bankruptcy, divorce, as well as expenses related to his children attending college. \nHe admitted not managing taxes well, but claims he has undergone tremendous personal \ngrowth since then. He worked diligently to resolve his tax issues, and holds himself to be \nresponsible and accountable. He currently earns $146,000 per year, has about $4,000 in \nliabilities, is paying on a mortgage, and has about $10,000 in cash. He submitted a page \nfrom a credit report showing a \u201cgood\u201d credit score. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

He incurred business losses that may have resulted \nfrom poor advice, employee misconduct, or difficult economic conditions that may have \nbeen outside of his control, however, I am not convinced that his failure to file Federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2018, or his failure to pay 2016 and 2017 \nFederal taxes when due were outside of his control. Although he has now filed all of his \ntax returns to date, and paid delinquent taxes, I am not convinced that he has established \na track record of consistent, on-time filing of tax returns when due, and payment of taxes \nowed when required. \nThe guideline encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules \nand systems is essential for protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s full tax history was not alleged in the SOR and may not be an \nindependent basis for denying his application for a security clearance. However, conduct \nnot alleged in the SOR may be considered to decide whether a particular adjudicative \nguideline is applicable, to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances, or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered Applicant\u2019s bankruptcies and, more importantly, his \nfailure to timely file his 2017-2019 state income tax returns when due; and failure to file \nhis 2019 and 2020 Federal tax returns when due. These tax filing and payment failures \nrepresent financial irresponsibility and will be considered for the limited purposes \ndescribed above. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been longstanding and remain a continuing \nconcern. I give mitigating credit for resolving his tax issues with the IRS and state, \nhowever, his repeated failure to file and pay federal income tax returns and taxes when \ndue have not been sufficiently mitigated given the number of years of non-compliance \nand disregard. I also have concerns about his overall financial responsibility and \nwillingness to comply with future income tax obligations. Applicant may have come to the \nrealization that timely filing and paying Federal income tax obligations is a significant \nresponsibility, however, it has been late in coming. By his own admission, he repeatedly \nfailed to seek financial counseling or use a tax professional to assist him with complicated \nreturns. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility, especially with regard to fulfilling his \nFederal income tax obligations when required, is questionable. He has a poor track record \nwith respect to Federal income tax compliance, and had many years to resolve his tax \nobligations, yet allowed them to remain unresolved until his ability to obtain a security \nclearance was jeopardized. Even then, he was slow to respond to the red flags raised \nabout his tax delinquencies since completing his SCA in 2018 and interview in 2019. I \nbelieve he fully grasps the reality of his tax obligations, but he has yet to show a consistent \nrecord of compliance with tax requirements. \nHis purported reasons for his tax issues, including pushing them out of mind, \ndivorce, supporting his children, and paying on the spec house, are insufficient to relieve \nhim from complying with his personal tax obligations and he has not provided sufficient \nevidence to show that these matters were outside of his control, especially for the entire \nspan of tax delinquency years. Applicant is intelligent and experienced in business and \naccounting. However, although he admitted to not managing taxes well and intentionally \nfailing to file returns when due, he has not sought recent financial counseling or tax \naccounting assistance. AG \u00b6 20 (d) and (g) apply as he has now filed all income tax \nreturns due, and paid off his Federal tax debt, and AG \u00b6 20 (e) applies to his extinguished \nstate tax debt. However, no mitigating condition fully relieves him of his overall financial \nirresponsibility with regard to meeting Federal income tax obligations on a timely basis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s business failure, periods of under employment or reduced income, family \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nresponsibilities, and alleged improprieties by his business accountant. I remain \nunconvinced of his overall financial responsibility, and his ability, intent, and desire to \nmeet his financial obligations in the future, especially in tax compliance given his history. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n  Subparagraph 1.d:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on June 22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c in part, and admitted the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d and 2.a. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old flight instructor employed by defense contractors since \nOctober 2017. He has worked for his current employer since April 21, 2022. (Tr. 11.) He \ngraduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in May 1998 and served on active duty until \nhe retired in September 2017 with the rank of major. While on active duty, he completed \n12 deployments and flew 304 combat missions consisting of more than 2,000 combat \nflight hours. He received numerous awards and commendations for his service, including \nthree awards of the Meritorious Service Medal, seven awards of the Air Medal, the Joint \nService Commendation Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal, and the Air Force \nAchievement Medal. (AX A, TAB E.) He held a security clearance throughout his military \nservice and as an employee of a defense contractor. His clearance has not been \nsuspended during the ongoing security clearance adjudication. (Tr. 179.) \nApplicant married in May 2003 and divorced in February 2005, due to his then \nwife\u2019s infidelity and drug abuse. He married again in June 2006, separated in January \n2019, and divorced in May 2019. He and his second ex-wife share custody of their five-\nyear-old daughter. He has lived with a cohabitant since June 2019. \nApplicant first consumed alcohol on his 21st  birthday, while he was a cadet. He and \nfellow cadets consumed a six-pack of beer and a bottle of cognac. He was very sick the \nnext day and did not drink again until the night he graduated from the Air Force academy, \nat age 23, when he consumed numerous \u201ctequila poppers\u201d and again was very sick. (Tr. \n120-21.). \nBeginning in about 2013, Applicant began drinking heavily, consuming about 350 \nmilliliters of whiskey every evening (six to seven standard drinks), but he abstained from \nalcohol for at least 12 hours before flying. He attributed his heavy drinking to the stress \nof an unhappy marriage. He used his educational benefits to allow his then wife to \ncomplete her education and begin a career as a nurse practitioner. He believed that his \nthen wife became totally involved in her own career and was no longer interested in \ncontributing to the marriage. (GX 2 at 5; GX 3 at 38.). His then wife and his brother \nattempted to intervene to stop his excessive drinking, without success.

(Tr. 113-14.) As a result of the attempted intervention and other \nfactors, Applicant is estranged from his brother. (GX 2 at 4.) Applicant is also estranged \nfrom his father because of his father\u2019s heavy alcohol consumption, use of marijuana, and \nabusive behavior. (Tr. 126; AX A, TAB F at 52.) He is close to his mother, who helped \nhim pay for inpatient treatment for an alcohol abuse disorder in 2018. \nAbout two or three months after the attempted intervention by his then wife and his \nbrother, Applicant voluntarily admitted himself into a medical facility, because he believed \nhe was drinking too much. (Tr. 114.) He chose the facility because it was advertised on \nthe Internet as a facility that specialized in trauma treatment, including trauma-induced \nsubstance abuse. (Tr. 133; AX A, TAB F at 53.) \nApplicant testified that there were two stressors in his life. The first was the result \nof 12 deployments, where he \u201ckilled a bunch of people, saw a lot of stuff that people \nprobably shouldn\u2019t see,\u201d and the second was \u201ca one-sided marriage.\u201d (Tr. 130.) \nFrom November 2018 to December 2018, Applicant was treated at the medical \nfacility. During his intake interview, he disclosed that on November 5, 2018, he was briefly \nhospitalized after threatening to kill himself after his wife took his alcohol away from him. \nHe disclosed that he made the threat to frighten his wife and make her realize \u201cwhere he \nwas emotionally,\u201d but he did not believe he was suicidal. (GX 3 at 30.) \nWhen Applicant was discharged from the medical facility, he was diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder, severe; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); anxiety disorder, \nunspecified; major depressive disorder, recurrent and unspecified; sleep disorder, \nunspecified; and exposure to disaster, war, and other hostilities. The discharge notes \nrecited that his alcohol use disorder was in remission; his PTSD was mild; his anxiety and \ndepression were in remission; and he was sleeping well. His follow-up recommendations \nincluded follow-up with his primary care doctor and a therapist. His prognosis was \u201cgood.\u201d \nThe suggestions for continued recovery were to attend 90 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings in 90 days, to obtain an AA sponsor, to continue receiving counseling, and to \nfind an AA \u201chome group\u201d where he could continue his AA participation. (GX 3 at 1-4.) He \ntestified that he was never advised to completely abstain from alcohol. (Tr. 119.) \nIn accordance with the recommendation of the medical facility, Applicant met with \na counselor, found his techniques unusual, and stopped seeing him after two visits. He \nattended AA meetings for a couple of months but found it unhelpful. (Tr. 113.) He had a \nsponsor and initially met with him at almost every meeting. (Tr. 160.) \nApplicant met his cohabitant while they both were being treated at the same \nmedical facility. His cohabitant was being treated for trauma, but not for an any alcohol \nissues, and she became his \u201crecovery friend.\u201d (Tr. 161, 169). He testified that his divorce \nin May 2019 removed much of the stress that caused his excessive drinking.

In September 2019, he and his cohabitant went out for dinner, where they each \nhad two drinks. At his cohabitant\u2019s suggestion, they went to a bar after dinner, where they \nmet several of Applicant\u2019s colleagues for drinks. Applicant drank too much, went to a fast-\nfood restaurant, and was rear-ended by another vehicle as he left the fast-food restaurant. \nThe other driver who rear-ended him claimed that Applicant pulled out in front of him. \nApplicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) with a \nblood-alcohol content (BAC) of greater than .15. On April 9, 2020, he pleaded guilty to \nDUI with a BAC of less than .15. On April 17, 2020, he was fined $50, required to perform \n30 days of community service and was placed on supervised probation for 11.29 months. \n(The fractional length of probation for 11.29 months is reflected in the court records but \nwas not explained in the records or elsewhere.) He was also required to attend a \nsubstance-abuse school and attend a victim-impact panel. His driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for six months. (GX 2 at 12-14.) He successfully completed his term of \nsupervised probation in April 2021. \nDuring a security interview in April 2020, Applicant told an investigator that he was \nconsuming about \u201ctwo fingers\u201d of whiskey twice a month on weekends. (GX 2 at 4.) His \nshared custody of his daughter motivates him to moderate his consumption. He testified, \n\u201cObviously, alcohol consumption and chasing around a 5-year-old is not conducive, so \nthat doesn't happen.\u201d (Tr. 117.) \nAfter Applicant received the SOR in January 2021, his attorney recommended that \nhe undergo a psychological evaluation. In February and March 2021, he was evaluated \nby a board-certified psychologist with extensive military and medical experience, including \nevaluations in connection with security clearance adjudications. (AX B.) The psychologist \nconcluded that Applicant met the diagnostic criteria for a moderate alcohol use disorder \nbetween early 2017 and late 2018, but he was in sustained remission at the time of the \nevaluation, and his prognosis was good because he did not have a long history of alcohol \nabuse and he had maintained sobriety for about 18 months before resuming moderate \nconsumption of alcohol. He concluded that Applicant does not have an alcohol use \ncondition that could negatively impact his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness and he \ndoes not have any behavioral pattern or personality characteristics that could render him \nunable or unwilling to safeguard national security information. (AX A at TAB F.) \nThe psychologist had two virtual meetings with Applicant shortly before the \nhearing, He testified that, based on the additional passage of time, he changed his \nprognosis from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cexcellent.\u201d (Tr. 36.) He disagreed with the December 2018 \ndiagnoses of severe alcohol use disorder and PTSD, describing them as \u201crelatively \nsloppily assigned,\u201d and he would have counseled Applicant rather than send him to \nsomeone else for treatment. (Tr. 38-39.) \nOn cross-examination, the psychologist testified that his diagnosis was based on \ninformation provided by Applicant. He had not seen the medical records from Applicant\u2019s \ntreatment in 2018. (Tr. 64.)

(Tr. 70-74, 84.) \nThe psychologist testified that he did not believe Applicant intentionally withheld \ninformation. He admitted that his opinions might have been different if he had been aware \nof the additional facts. However, even after learning about the additional facts, he still \nbelieved that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is good. (Tr. 102.) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s coworkers, who has known him for about ten years and is a \nlieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, testified that he has never observed him \ndrink to excess, come to work under the influence of alcohol, or drive a vehicle after \ndrinking. He considers Applicant reliable, honest and trustworthy. He believes that \nApplicant\u2019s DUI was a one-time mistake that he regrets and will not repeat. (Tr. 18-21; \nAX A, TAB G.) \nAnother coworker, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has known Applicant \nfor about 22 years, has become a good friend since around 2018.

He has never observed Applicant intoxicated, come to work intoxicated, or operate \na vehicle or any type of equipment under the influence of alcohol. He considers Applicant \nhonest and trustworthy. He testified that when they go to lunch or dinner, Applicant usually \ndoes not drink, but when he drinks the amount is insignificant. (Tr. 23-28; AX A. TAB H.) \nThe training integrator who supervises Applicant has known him for more than 13 \nyears. He regards Applicant as \u201cone of the best and most thoughtful pilots\u201d that he has\nknown. He notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that Applicant would never\nattempt to operate an aircraft while impaired. He told the FAA that \u201cit is just not how he is\nwired.\u201d (AX A, TAB I.) \n \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR and at the hearing, he submitted a statement \nof intent not to abuse alcohol in the future, and he agreed that any alcohol abuse would \nconstitute grounds for automatic revocation of his security clearance.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

It also alleges that in about \nSeptember 2019, he was charged with DUI with a BAC more than .15, that he pleaded \nguilty to DUI with a BAC of less than .15, that he was placed on probation for 11.29 \nmonths, and that he remained on probation until about April 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), and 22(d). The disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 22(f) is not established, because there is no evidence establishing that \nany medical provider recommended that Applicant completely abstain from consuming \nalcohol.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are established.

The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on whether the conduct was recent. \nThere are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant \nperiod of time has passed without recurrence, then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \nBefore Applicant\u2019s DUI in September 2019, he had been careful to confine his \ndrinking to off-duty hours at home and more than 12 hours before flying. He resisted his \nthen wife\u2019s attempts to intervene, which was understandable because she was the source \nof his stress. Shortly after his then wife\u2019s efforts, he acknowledged his problem and \nvoluntarily sought treatment, which he completed. The source of the stress caused by the \ndeterioration of his marriage of ten years apparently has been resolved by divorce and is \nunlikely to recur. The testimonials of the coworkers and supervisors indicate that he has \ncontinued his outstanding duty performance. He recognizes that he will not receive a \nsecond chance if he abuses alcohol again. By submitting his signed declaration of intent, \nhe has placed himself on probation, and he is not likely to again risk his lifelong love of \nflying. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is not fully established. Applicant successfully completed his treatment \nprogram and has adhered to a pattern of moderate alcohol consumption for almost three \nyears.

The \nconcern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about \na person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nAG \u00b6 31(a) is not established, because a single incident does not constitute a \npattern. However, AG \u00b6 31(b) is established by Applicant\u2019s conviction of DUI. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established, for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of Guideline G. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere, candid,\nremorseful, and credible at the hearing. He served as an Air Force officer h\n onorably and\nwith distinction for 20 years, with considerable service under combat conditions. He is\nhighly regarded by his colleagues and supervisors, who believe that his DUI was a one-\ntime incident that will not recur. He has voluntarily sought and received treatment for the\nstressful conditions he endured. He loves being a pilot, and the risk of losing his pilot\u2019s\nlicense has been a major motivator to moderate his alcohol consumption. He has placed\nhimself on probation by submitting the letter of intent. He has received a \u201cgood\u201d prognosis\nfrom medical professionals. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nunder Guidelines G and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole\nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol\nconsumption and criminal conduct. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

However, those concerns are mitigated by his growing \nrelationships and loyalties to the United States. Eligibility for security clearance access \nis granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 9, 2019, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On May 9, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Department of \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) could not make the \npreliminary affirmative findings required to grant a security clearance. The DCSA \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated January 6, 2021, detailing \nsecurity concerns under the guideline for foreign influence (Guideline B). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n1 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD \non June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on February 20, 2021.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on November 9, 2021, for a hearing on December 13, 2021. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s four exhibits (GE) 1-4 and \nApplicant\u2019s seven exhibits (AE) A-G were entered into evidence without objection. The \nrecord in this case closed on December 16, 2021 when DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) of the hearing. \nAdministrative Notice \nThe Government requested that I take administrative notice of certain relevant \nfacts related to Iraq. The facts are limited to matters of general knowledge and not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. The Government\u2019s administrative notice memorandum \nand source material is identified as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant had no \nadministrative facts that he wanted me to take administrative notice of regarding the \nRepublic of Iraq. (Tr. 11) \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR identifies six allegations under Guideline B (foreign influence). \nApplicant admitted all allegations. He noted that his potential inheritance of a house \nlocated on a parcel of land was less than $400,000. (SOR 1.f) All references to the \ngovernment exhibits shall be to the typed page numbers that are in the upper right \ncorner or at the bottom of the page. \nApplicant, 40 years old, was born in Iraq in 1981. He received his Iraqi \nhigh school diploma in July 2000, and an electrician\u2019s certificate that allowed him to \navoid compulsory service in the Iraqi military. (GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 4) He assumed \nfinancial responsibility for his mother and two sisters after his father died in a train \naccident in 2004. (Answer to SOR at 3) As shall be discussed below, from 2004 to late \n2013, Applicant was an Iraqi police officer. He married his wife, an Iraqi citizen, in \n2010. (GE 1 at 26) Their ceremony took place in Iraq. They immigrated to the United \nStates after he received death threats in 2012. After his wife\u2019s cousin, an Iraqi linguist \nemployed by the U.S. military, was assassinated by terrorists in September 2013, they \nimmigrated to the United States later in the same month. (GE 2 at 5) Applicant\u2019s two \nchildren, seven and five years old, were born in the United States. His wife is also \npregnant. He and his wife became U.S. citizens in 2019. She has been employed by a \ndepartment store as a salesperson since 2017. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. 6, 16-21, 45) \nBackground \nIn 2003, the coalition forces began to hire Iraqis into linguist and police officer \npositions.

(Answer to SOR at 3; GE 2 at 1, 8; AE \nB2) \nFor the first five years of employment as a patrol officer, Applicant went on \npatrols with United States Army (USA), helping them remove improvised explosive \ndevices (IEDs) from the roads. He also worked with them as a secondary linguist when \ntheir primary linguist was absent. (Tr. 32-33) In 2008, he was promoted to internal \naffairs of the Ministry of Interior, and ultimately promoted to detective in that division. \nHe was assigned to the director\u2019s office where one of his responsibilities was to gather \nand marshal documents for the prime minister\u2019s review. In addition to resigning from \nthe ministry because of his wife\u2019s cousin\u2019s assassination, he resigned from the ministry \nafter receiving repeated death threats in 2012 from Iran proxies to leave his position \nbecause of his affiliation to the wrong religious faith. (Answer to SOR at 3; GE 2 at 4; \n(Tr. 32-37) \nApplicant considered his collaborative Iraqi police work with the coalition \nforces and his cousin\u2019s assassination as two important factors that could qualify him for \nrefugee status to increase his chances of immigrating to the United States. So he \napplied for that status through the International Organization for Migration (IOM). After \nmany interviews at the United States (U.S.) Embassy in Iraq in 2013, Applicant\u2019s \nrefugee status was approved, and he immigrated to United States in the same year. In \n2014, he received U.S. permanent resident status. Applicant has not been back to Iraq \nsince 2013, and has no intention of returning in the future. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 2; Tr. \n36, 46) \nBetween 2013 and March 2018, Applicant worked in the United States at three \narmed security positions and was a security manager at a reputable department store. \nHe was fired from one of those positions for an arrest made without sufficient probable \ncause. The termination does not tarnish his employment history because he was \nimmediately hired by a competitive department store\u2019s security team. (GE 1 at 17; GE \n3 at 5) In August 2018, Applicant established a military supply business that designs \nand sells clothing and accessories to police and military personnel. (GE 2 at 2) For a \nperiod of time in 2019 that is not clear from Applicant\u2019s testimony, after receiving his \nU.S. citizenship in April 2019, and applying for his current linguist position, he applied \nfor another linguist position and received an interim security clearance. Following \ntraining, he was sent to another U.S. state for supplemental training and then to Iraq \nunder a six-month contract. However, the then-president of the United States \ndownsized the unit Applicant was working for, and he was sent back to the United \nStates in late 2019. (Tr. 47-48) Though he indicated he was scheduled to begin \nsecurity training with the Department of State in early 2020, there is no indication from \nthe record that his training was initiated or completed. Since June 2020, Applicant has \nbeen working as a security officer for a federal agency.

(AE B1) \nA former senior law enforcement advisor indicated in letters of July 2020 and \nJanuary 2014, that he was assigned to head of police recruitment in 2004, where he \nmet Applicant. The law advisor extoled Applicant\u2019s work ethic and his practical \napproach to getting problems solved. He believes Applicant warrants a security \nposition (AE B2, B6) \nOn October 24, 2019, one of the commanding officers of the coalition forces, \ncommended Applicant for his linguist services from July-November 2019. For the four-\nmonth period, Applicant helped the coalition forces reinstate advisor operations in \nnorthwest Iraq. The author of this recommendation stated that he would take Applicant \nanywhere. Applicant received a certificate of appreciation on November 1, 2019. (AE \nB3, E1) \nIn an undated endorsement, another linguist reported that she met \nApplicant in 2019.

(AE B4) \nIn an undated letter, another linguist indicated he worked with Applicant \nfor an unidentified period with in an Iraqi location. Applicant always showed \nprofessionalism in carrying out his assignments. His positive attitude at work justified \nhis application for security clearance eligibility. (AE B5) \nOn October 19, 2021, Applicant received a certificate for completing a \nsupervision and management course. (AE E2) \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Republic of Iraq \nIraq is a parliamentary republic that continues to evolve into a stable country. \nThe outcome of the 2014 parliamentary elections met international standards of fair \nelections and led to the peaceful transition of leadership from former Prime Minister \nNouri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. \nIn December 2019 because of the constant demand for changes in the Iraq \npolitical system, Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi resigned. A new prime minister was \nconfirmed by the Iraq cabinet in May 2020. He promised to improve security and fight \ncorruption. Several assassinations later in 2020 of protest leaders and a well-known \nresearcher caused serious doubt in whether the new prime minister would be able to \naccomplish his objective. \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens living in Iraq are at a high risk \nfor kidnapping and terrorist violence. The U.S. Government considers the potential \nthreats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to \nlive and work under strict security guidelines. \nA 2019 human rights report indicated that serious human rights problems are \nstill widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility and corruption at all levels of government \nhave diluted the Iraqi government\u2019s human rights protections. Other human rights-\nrelated problems include: dangerous conditions in prisons and detention facilities; \narbitrary arrest and pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression and assembly; \nand discrimination based on gender, race, and religion. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, \nwhich are flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which \nthe foreign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and  \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncould subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation. As set forth in AG \u00b6 7(b), connections to family members are only \ndisqualifying if they create a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s potential \nsecurity duties and his desire to assist his foreign family members. Applicant\u2019s father \npassed away in 2004. After he immigrated to United States in September 2013, he \ncontacted his mother almost daily and provided financial support to her in Iraq. After \nshe immigrated to the United States and moved into Applicant\u2019s house in August 2021, \nhe has continued to provide financial and emotional support. Even though she is still a \ncitizen of Iraq, she raises less security concerns because she is now a permanent \nresident of the United States. Applicant\u2019s youngest sister generates even less concern \nas she and her entire family are now U.S. citizens. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s \noldest sister and his police friend are citizens and residents of Iraq. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) apply. However, the disqualifying conditions are less relevant to the friend at \npresent because Applicant stopped communicating with him about 10 months ago. AG \n\u00b6 7(e) also applies to Applicant\u2019s future interest in the Iraqi house. Under one or more \nof the three above disqualifying conditions, terrorists or insurgents hostile to U.S \ninterests and citizens, could exert pressure on his older sister, his law enforcement \nfriend, or to a lesser degree, his mother, to compel Applicant to compromise classified \nor sensitive information. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation. \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his older sister are not casual and infrequent. \nHowever, the current interaction with the friend who is an Iraqi police officer, has been \nnonexistent since about January 2021. AG \u00b6 8(c) has some application to the Iraqi \npolice officer who Applicant no longer communicates with. \nApplicant receives considerable mitigation under AG \u00b6 8 (b). Because of his \nstrong loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor \nof U.S interests. While he was an Iraqi police officer from 2004 to 2013, he assisted \ncoalition forces in clearing dangerous ordinances from roads, and also performing \nlinguistic services when the primary linguist was unavailable. Despite leaving Iraq \nunder refugee status and in fear of his life in 2013, he returned to the country for a four-\nmonth period in 2019 to help coalition forces in a linguist and cultural advisor capacity, \nand performed commendably. \nApplicant\u2019s inheritance interest in the Iraqi house is significant, particularly \nwhen juxtaposed to his small financial interests in the United States. However, based \non Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States, I do not foresee the foreign property interest \nto be of such a size to effectively pressure or manipulate him to compromise U.S. \ninterests. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence and foreign \npreference guidelines in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person \nconcept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nAs addressed under foreign influence, Applicant\u2019s foreign inheritance interest \nis significant. However, I am confident Applicant can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests because: (1) after beginning his career as \nan Iraqi police officer in 2004, he spent considerable time with coalition forces \nimproving safety and security in the country while providing de facto linguist duties; (2) \nhe has lived in the United States since 2013; (3) after he became a U.S. citizen in \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \n2019, he returned to Iraq to perform linguist and cultural advisor duties for coalition \nforces; and, (4) he currently resides in the United States with his wife, also a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, two children born in the United States, with a third child on the \nway, his mother, and his younger sister with her family. Considering the evidence from \nan overall commonsense point of view, Applicant has met his heavy burden of \nmitigating the security concerns based on the foreign influence guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. \nPaul J.

Applicant was unable to make his \ncar payment after his pay was significantly reduced, and his vehicle was repossessed in \n2017. (Tr. 50) In 2018 or 2019, he tried to discuss the debt with the creditor; however, the \ncreditor was unwilling to discuss the debt with him because it was charged off.

And I, at the time, was not able \nto make any payments online, and then I just ignored it.\u201d (Tr. 52) On August 4, 2022, \nApplicant contacted the creditor, and the creditor agreed to a $100 monthly payment plan \nwith the first payment due on August 8, 2022. (AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a delinquent debt related to a repossessed vehicle for $11,768. \nApplicant said the balance was about $11,000 at the time the vehicle was repossessed. \nIn 2017 or 2018, the vehicle was sold at auction, and the creditor advised him in a letter \nthat the balance after the sale was $1,600.

(AE D; AE F) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nId. (internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant experienced underemployment, unemployment, separation, overseas \nemployment, his mother\u2019s illness, variations in income, and is pending divorce. These are \ncircumstances largely beyond his control, which adversely affected his finances. \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider whether \napplicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial \ndifficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with his SOR creditors or that he made written offers to \nmake partial payments to them. He said he did not make any contacts with his creditors \nfrom the date of his receipt of the January 12, 2021 SOR to the date of his hearing on \nJuly 14, 2022. \nApplicant is credited with mitigating the following SOR debts: \u00b6 1.d for $472; \u00b6 1.f \nfor $1,675. \u00b6 1.g for $7,493; \u00b6 1.h for $643; and \u00b6 1.i for $174. He said he paid these five \ndebts, and they do not appear on his 2020 and 2022 credit reports.  \nApplicant is not credited with mitigating his other SOR debts. His annual pay from \nMay 2021 through the date of his hearing was $149,000. He was also receiving disability \nfrom the VA and not paying his mortgage. He did not prove he was unable to establish a \npayment plan and make some payments to more of his SOR creditors. See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03612 at 3 (Aug. 25, 2015) (\u201cIndeed, even if a credit report states that a debt has \nbeen paid, that fact alone does not, in and of itself, resolve concerns arising from the \ndilatory nature of an applicant\u2019s response to his debts or other circumstances that detract \nfrom an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. In this case, the Judge commented on the \nabsence of detailed evidence about how Applicant addressed his finances and \nreasonably had doubts about his clearance eligibility based on that lack of evidence\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-payment of several of his SOR debts has important \nsecurity implications. See ISCR Case No. 20-01004 at 3 (App. Bd. June 28, 2021) \n(\u201cResolution of a delinquent debt does not preclude further inquiry or examination \nregarding it.

Feb. 17, 2017)). Even if he paid the delinquent \nSOR debts after receipt of the SOR, this would not automatically mitigate security \nconcerns. \n[T]he timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not threatened. \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). \nOne function of an SOR is to place an Applicant on notice of a particular security \nconcern, such as finances and delinquent debts. A financially-based SOR provides an \nApplicant an opportunity to show good faith and establish payment plans, pay debts, or \notherwise mitigate security concerns. An Applicant who is insensitive to the importance \nof compliance with promises to repay borrowed funds and to expeditiously resolve \nsecurity concerns may not diligently act to safeguard security. \nGiven his income and available funds, Applicant did not demonstrate that he was \nunable to make more progress sooner in the resolution of several of his SOR debts. There \nis insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being resolved. Under all the \ncircumstances, he failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old logistics management analyst who has been working for \na DOD contractor since March 2021. He has been at an overseas location since May of \n2021. He honorably served on active duty in the Army from 1992 to 1997, and in the Army \nReserve from 2010 to 2019. He was a sergeant when he left the Army Reserve. He has \nperiodically held a security clearance since 1995. There is no evidence of any security \nviolations. \nApplicant provided important mitigating information. His finances were harmed by \nseveral circumstances largely beyond his control. He is credited with mitigating the \nfollowing SOR debts: \u00b6 1.d ($472); \u00b6 1.f ($1,675); \u00b6 1.g ($7,493); \u00b6 1.h ($643); and \u00b6 1.i \n($174). He said he paid these five debts, and they do not appear on his 2020 and 2022 \ncredit reports. He is credited with mitigating these five SOR allegations. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nThe January 12, 2021 SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $75,798. Applicant did \nnot make any payments after receipt of the SOR to address four SOR debts totaling \n$65,341. Since May 2021, Applicant\u2019s annual income has been $149,000. He has been \nreceiving VA disability payments and not paying his mortgage for more than one year. He \nfailed to provide persuasive information to explain why he was unable to make greater \nprogress sooner resolving the four remaining SOR debts. He did not employ reasonable \nand prudent actions to check on these debts after he received notice from the SOR. He \ndid not show a track record of consistent payments to address these four debts. His \nfinancial history raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debts, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(Item 4) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concerns related to this guideline: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Three are potentially applicable: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n   (f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or      \nholding a sensitive position. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant tested positive for cocaine, an illegal substance under \nFederal law. He held a security clearance when he tested positive. The evidence raised \nthe above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nextenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThere is insufficient record evidence to establish any of the listed mitigating \nconditions. Applicant admitted that he tested positive for cocaine in March 2019, but does \nnot recall ingesting it. He admitted that he had consumed a large amount of alcohol the \nevening before the test, which raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness and \nreliability. Although the positive test occurred over three years ago and there are no other \nincidents involving the use of illegal substances since then, Applicant did not submit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n     \n               \n \n \n \n \nevidence to demonstrate that similar problems will not recur and that he does not have a \ndrug problem. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b) and 26(c), do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant tested positive for \ncocaine a day after he had consumed a large amount of alcohol. He held a security \nclearance at the time. Those three facts leave me with significant doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability and eligibility for a security clearance. Overall, Applicant failed to meet his \nburden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for drug involvement \nand substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did mot mitigate financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 17, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

This \ncase was assigned to me on October 26, 2021. A hearing was scheduled for December \n9, 202, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of six exhibits (GEs 1-6). Applicant relied on one exhibit (AE A) and one \nwitness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 15, 2021. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open \nto permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with updated payment \ninformation on his debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($9,187), 1.d ($1,695), 1.f ($118), \nand 1.k ($2,271). For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to \nsupplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded three days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documentation \nof his payment history of debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.h, as well as his \npayment history with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.j. He also provided endorsements. \nApplicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as AEs B-D. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 11 delinquent debts \nexceeding $33,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the alleged debts with \nexplanations. He denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i, claiming he \nwas unaware of the debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.g and a return of the equipment covered \nby SOR \u00b6 1.i. Addressing the allegations he admitted, he claimed he is working to \nresolve the listed debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j (two repossessed vehicles), as \nwell as those debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e and 1.h-1.k. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old mechanic for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance.

(AE E) Previously, he was \nemployed by other employers in various positions. He has held a security position while \nemployed by his last-reported employer of record. \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2014 and 2017, Applicant accumulated 11 delinquent medical and \nconsumer debts (including an adverse judgment obtained by SOR creditor 1.j in \nOctober 2017 for $13,578) exceeding $33,000. (GEs 2-6; Tr. 16-20, 40) He attributed \nhis debt delinquencies to a difficult divorce from his second wife in March 2017 and poor \nfinancial decisions. (Tr. 30-31) \nTo date, Applicant has made little progress in resolving his debt delinquencies. \nMore specifically, he has been unable to document any of his listed SOR debts with \nvoluntary payments. While one of the listed SOR debts (a $13,578 adverse judgment \nentered against Applicant in June 2018 and covered by SOR \u00b6 1.j) appears to have \nbeen reduced by a combination of garnishment and voluntary means (GE 6; Tr. 25-26, \n37), the judgment debt remains unsatisfied without any evidence of recent efforts by \nApplicant to satisfy the balance. \nBased on the documentation in evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s remaining debts \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i and 1.k have been addressed and paid, or otherwise \nsatisfied by other voluntary means. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 21-22, 31-34) Neither Applicant\u2019s pre-\nhearing or hearing claims to have satisfied most of the listed SOR debts nor his \npromises to do so, are enough to credit him with resolving his debt delinquencies. One  \nof Applicant\u2019s small debts (notably SOR \u00b6 1.g), he could not identify. (Tr. 36-37) Other \npreviously delinquent debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 2007. (Tr. 43) \nAfforded post-hearing opportunities to address his delinquent medical and \nconsumer debts with documented payments and payment plans, Applicant did not \nprovide any documentation of resolving his listed SOR debts. He earned $65,000 in \ncalendar year 2021 from his listed employment and owns a metal fabrication business \nthat nets him an additional $6,600 a year. (Tr. 68-69) \nMonthly child support payments to his first spouse for his youngest child totals \n$103 a month and are current. His other monthly expenses exceed $3,000, which leave \nhim with a monthly remainder in the range of $1,500 to $1,800.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                    Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts \nover a four-year span (2014-2017) that he has not paid or otherwise favorably resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s accrual of delinquent debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying \nconditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these \nDCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debts negate the need for any independent proof. See \nDirective 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His\nadmitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create some initial judgment\nissues. See ISCR case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24 2004). \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with his post-divorce in 2017, have not for the \nmost part been addressed by any documented post-divorce payment initiatives. \nExtenuating conditions played some role in Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations \nduring his post-divorce struggles to satisfy the debts assigned to him in his 2017 divorce \ndecree. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory \nlending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. While he satisfied the first \nprong of the mitigating condition, he failed to exhibit the responsible repayment efforts \nrequired to satisfy the second prong of MC \u00b6 20(d). \nBy failing to settle or resolve most of his accounts (excepting for the small debt \ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.g which is credited to him), Applicant has not been able to \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n             \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nsuccessfully stabilize his finances and reduce the risks of recurrent financial issues. \nBased on the evidence developed in the record, none of the other potentially available \nmitigating conditions may be relied on by Applicant. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, he has not addressed his listed SOR debts with \ndocumented payments and payment plans necessary to satisfy minimum criteria to \nmeet the eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance.   \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a security clearance. Applicant is entitled to major credit for his military and \ncivilian contributions to the DoD and defense industry, respectively. His positive \ncharacter references, while worthy of considerable credit, are not enough at this time to \novercome his past account delinquencies and restore his finances to current status. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

He attended college between March 2007 and October \n2012, when he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been in a civil marriage since \nJanuary 2020. He previously married in 2000 and divorced in 2018. He has a 16-year-\nold daughter. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history indicates he was employed as a communications \ntechnician between June 2007 and February 2017. After holding small jobs for short \nperiods, he was unemployed between April 2017 and November 2017. He worked as a \ndepartment manager between November 2017 and August 2018, and as a foreman \nbetween August 2018 and November 2018. He worked as a communications technician \nbetween November 2018 and January 2020. He has been working as an IT technician \nand engineering intern for his current employer and security sponsor, a federal \ncontractor, since January 2020. \nIn his SOR responses, Applicant averred his U.S. Department of Education \nstudent loans were paid off by company \u201cA,\u201d who was then collecting on the student \nloans. He presented no documentary evidence to corroborate his allegations. In his \nanswer to the FORM, Applicant stated he consolidated all of his federal student loans \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h) into one loan with one payment, and entered into a \nrehabilitation program to run from September 2021 to June 2022. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate these claims. \nConcerning his private student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.n) in collection by \n\u201cA,\u201d Applicant claimed they were now being serviced and collected by company \u201cN\u201d. He \nclaimed he contacted \u201cN\u201d and asked for his options to start a repayment plan. He \nsubmitted no documentary evidence to corroborate these claims. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his January 2020 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he owed about $99,000 in student loans. He stated that he got behind \npaying his student loans after he was laid off from a job (unemployed) and later on he \nonly found jobs at a reduced salary (underemployed). He overextended himself \nfinancially by using credit cards to pay for living expenses. He did not pay his student \nloans because his income was insufficient to pay his living expenses and student loans. \nHe claimed: \u201cI am starting to get on a schedule of getting things paid off. I have auto \nwithdrawals on many of the student loans and I am paying what I can on the charged off \ncredit card.\u201d (2020 SCA, Section 26) \nThe February 2020 credit report (FORM, Item 5) shows SOR \u00b6 1.a as a charged-\noff credit account for $10,547. The March 2021 credit report (FORM, Item 4) shows the \naccount with the same balance. Applicant submitted no documentary evidence to \ncorroborate he has made any payments to this account. \nWhen asked to provide the reasons for his financial problems, Applicant stated \n\u201cmoney issues, job issues, as jobs changed money changed and I had to prioritize what \nmoney was going to what bill and some, if not most of [the student loans] could [not] get \npaid.\u201d When asked to provide the current status of his financial issues, Applicant stated: \n\u201cI have become more stable now and I am able to pay more. I am getting reevaluated in \nApril and I am going to make higher payments. I am on auto withdrawals right now on \nall the student loans and I am working on payment arrangements with the charged-off \n(account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a).\u201d He submitted no documentary evidence to corroborate \nhe has made any payments on the charged-off credit card account. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that after graduating from college, \nbetween 2014 and 2018, he was unable to find a job commensurate to his degree and \nhad to work lower paying jobs. His spouse paid most of the bills at the time. He \nseparated and divorced in 2018, and that resulted in his income dropping drastically. \nWithout his ex-wife\u2019s financial help he was unable to pay his debts. He used the credit \ncard account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a to pay his living expenses. (Answer to SOR) \nApplicant submitted documentary evidence showing that in October 2017, he \nsettled, for less than owed, two of his student loans. The two student loans are not \nalleged in the SOR, but the 2021 credit report corroborates they were settled and paid \nafter they were charged off. (FORM, Item 4) \nApplicant presented no evidence to show he has participated in financial \ncounseling or has a working budget. He did not present evidence of his and his wife\u2019s \ncurrent financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and \nmonthly net remainder). \nExcept for the alleged student loans and the charged-off account alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit report shows that he is living within his financial means, \nand that he has acquired no additional delinquent accounts.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. Between 2007 and \n2012, he attended college and accumulated a large number of student loans. After \ncollege, he was unable to find a good paying job, and was underemployed for a period \nand unemployed between April and November 2017. He was divorced in 2018, and his \nearnings were reduced. Because of the reduced earnings, he was unable to pay his \ndebts and living expenses. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant acquired a large debt financing his college education. He was unable to \nfind a good paying job and had a period of unemployment in 2017. His then wife was \nhelping him with his finances, but they divorced in 2018. His earnings were reduced and \nhis income alone was insufficient to pay the accrued debts and living expenses. His \nfinancial problems could be attributed to, or were aggravated by, circumstances beyond \nhis control (divorce, unemployment, and underemployment). \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show he has been \nfinancially responsible under his circumstances. He failed to submit evidence of his \ncontacts with his creditors or of any payments made since he acquired the student \nloans or other debts, except for the two student loans that he settled for less than owed. \nHe failed to present documentary evidence of consolidation of his student loans, \nrehabilitation efforts, and current payment schedules. He failed to establish he has \ntaken good-faith efforts to resolve his other delinquent debts and that his financial \nsituation is under control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \nIn this instance, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial responsibility, and that his financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the future, without further confirmed \nactions, are insufficient. Additionally, he presented no evidence to show he has \nparticipated in financial counseling or has a working budget. He did not present \nevidence of his current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly \nexpenses, and monthly net remainder). The financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 50, has been employed with a federal contractor since January 2020. \nThis is his first SCA. His evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been financially \nresponsible addressing his delinquent accounts. He failed to establish he has taken \ngood-faith efforts to resolve his debts and that his financial situation is under control. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and its amendments, he admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 3.a, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Background Applicant is a 36-year-old ship designer employed by a defense contractor since January 2017. He was unemployed from September 2014 to January 2017. He received an interim security clearance in 2019. (Tr. 17.) Applicant married in September 2010, divorced in November 2015, married in November 2016, and separated in August 2017. He has two children, ages 11 and 15. Applicant attended a community college from August 2012 to March 2014 and a university from August 2014 to May 2016. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in graphic design in May 2016. Financial Considerations The amended SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts and a wage garnishment. The debts are reflected in credit reports from April 2020, November 2020, and September 2022 (GX 2, 3, and 4), and court records reflecting judgments (GX 5, 6, and 7). Applicant admitted all the debts in his answer to the amended SOR, stated that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i had been paid, and stated that he was working on resolving the three debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l. 2 The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. SOR \u00b6 1.a: medical debt placed for collection of $1,861. This debt became delinquent in May 2017. The November 2020 credit report reflects that it is disputed. (GX 3 at 1.) Appli",

All the amendments are incorporated \nin the document captioned as \u201cSecond Amended Statement of Reasons, dated \nSeptember 23, 2022. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 3, 2022.  \nScheduling of the hearing was delayed by COVID-19. On September 6, 2022, the \ncase was assigned to me. On September 15, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be conducted by \nvideo teleconference on October 13, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 14 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX \n15, an unauthenticated summary of an interview conducted by a security investigator, \nwas not admitted. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other \nwitnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until November \n4, 2022, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A, B, and C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 25, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and its amendments, he admitted all the \nallegations except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 3.a, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. \nBackground \nApplicant is a 36-year-old ship designer employed by a defense contractor since \nJanuary 2017. He was unemployed from September 2014 to January 2017. He received \nan interim security clearance in 2019. (Tr. 17.) \nApplicant married in September 2010, divorced in November 2015, married in \nNovember 2016, and separated in August 2017. He has two children, ages 11 and 15. \nApplicant attended a community college from August 2012 to March 2014 and a \nuniversity from August 2014 to May 2016. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in graphic \ndesign in May 2016. \nFinancial Considerations \nThe amended SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts and a wage garnishment. The \ndebts are reflected in credit reports from April 2020, November 2020, and September \n2022 (GX 2, 3, and 4), and court records reflecting judgments (GX 5, 6, and 7). Applicant \nadmitted all the debts in his answer to the amended SOR, stated that the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i had been paid, and stated that he was working on resolving the three \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: medical debt placed for collection of $1,861. This debt became \ndelinquent in May 2017. The November 2020 credit report reflects that it is disputed. (GX \n3 at 1.) Applicant submitted no evidence of the basis for the dispute or its resolution. In \nhis answer to the SOR, he claimed that the debt was paid in full. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence supporting his claim. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $63. This debt \nbecame delinquent in September 2019. (GX 3 at 2.) Applicant paid it on April 16, 2021. \n(AX A.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: debt to insurance company placed for collection of $126. The \nNovember 2020 credit report reflects this debt. (G 3 at 2.) It is not reflected in the \nSeptember 2020 credit report (GX 4.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he claimed that \nthis debt was paid in full, but he did not submit any documentation to support his claim. \nThe fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any \nmeaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. ISCR Case No. 18-\n01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h: two medical debts placed for collection of $75, \none debt for $135, and one for $1,691. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he claimed \nthat these debts were paid in full. He submitted no documentary evidence to support his \nclaim. At the hearing, he testified that he had limited medical insurance while in college, \nand his insurance either did not cover the medical expenses or did not pay the full cost of \nthe medical care. He had at least one serious medical issue with a hernia. (Tr. 19.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: automobile loan past due for $628. The November 2020 credit report \nreflects this debt. (GX 3 at 3.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he claimed that this debt \nwas paid in full. The September 2022 credit report reflects a \u201cpaid repossession\u201d and a \nzero balance due. (GX 4 at 6.) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $274. The alleged \ncreditor for this debt is the same as the $63 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The April 2020 credit \nreport reflects two debts to this creditor, one of which was disputed and resolved in favor \nof the debtor, but the credit report does not list the amounts. The SOR does not reflect \nthe account numbers of the two debts to this creditor. Even though the amounts are \ndifferent, the one debt that was not disputed appears to be the same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nwhich has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: default judgment for $924 filed on February 29, 2016. (GX 5.) At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that he was unaware of this judgment. He learned about it \nwhen he was searching for court records regarding the judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k \nand 1.l. He denied this debt and testified that he had never obtained a loan from this \ncreditor. (Tr. 21.) He suspects identity theft. (Tr. 39.) He provided no documentary \nevidence of actions to dispute or otherwise resolve this debt. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l: judgments for $113 and $211 filed in 2017. (GX 6.) \nApplicant testified that these judgments were for unpaid personal property taxes. He had \nrecently moved and did not receive the notices of taxes due, and did not know about the \njudgments for unpaid taxes. (Tr. 39.) He submitted no evidence that the judgments have \nbeen satisfied. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: wage garnishment in 2020 for $1,483. Applicant testified that he \nbelieved this garnishment was for unpaid personal property taxes. (Tr. 39.) However, the \nevidence reflects that a default judgment for unpaid rent was filed against Applicant in \nSeptember 2019 for $1,101, plus costs and attorney fees, and Applicant\u2019s pay was \ngarnished to collect the judgment. (GX 7.) \nApplicant testified that his delinquent debts were due to \u201cgrowing pains, growing \nup,\u201d and not knowing how to manage his money. (Tr. 18-19.) He submitted no evidence \nof financial counseling. \nCriminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption \nIn September 2014, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). \nHe was convicted and sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended for 60 days), fined $300, \nand charged with court costs of $340. His driver\u2019s license was restricted for 12 months. \n(GX 12.) He testified that he was required to attend an alcohol safety class and had to \ninstall a breathalyzer in his car for six months. (Tr. 26.) He testified that he now consumes \nalcohol rarely, and he limits his consumption to drinking wine on special occasions like \nChristmas or Thanksgiving. (Tr. 26-27.) \nOn January 12, 2016, Applicant was charged with driving without a license. He \ntestified that his license was suspended because of an unpaid fine. (Tr. 23.) He has since \npaid the fine. He pleaded guilty to driving without a valid license and was fined $600 plus \ncourt costs. (GX 10.) \nOn January 12, 2016, Applicant was charged with failure to appear in court on \nDecember 16, 2015. He testified that he was challenging a speeding ticket and was \nscheduled for a court hearing, but that he mixed up the dates and forgot the correct court \ndate. (Tr. 24.) He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended for 60 \ndays, and placed on unsupervised probation for three years. (GX 8; GX 11.) \nIn October 2020, Applicant was charged with violation of a protective order. The \nrecord contains no evidence of the basis for the order or the charge of violating it, except \nfor Applicant\u2019s testimony. He testified that a neighbor threatened his wife and then \nobtained a protective order against him. The neighbors did not appear at the hearing. (Tr. \n22-23.) In February 2021, the charge was dismissed. (GX 9.) \nIn November 2021, Applicant was charged with felony child cruelty and felony child \nneglect after he spanked his son. His son was not seriously injured, but he had marks on \nhis buttocks.

Applicant still has joint custody of his \nson and is entitled to supervised visitation. (Tr. 35.) \nIn May 2022, Applicant was charged with DWI, 2nd  offense, and refusing a \nbreathalyzer test within 10 years after a DWI conviction. (GX 14.) Applicant testified that \nwhile he was driving, his wife wanted to stop at a restaurant on the left side of the road. \nHe moved to the left-turn lane. His wife changed her mind, and he abruptly moved back \ninto the travel lane. A police officer observed the maneuver and stopped him. Applicant \ndenied having consumed any alcohol before driving. (Tr. 29.) He testified that he refused \nto take a breathalyzer test because his research reflected that such tests are unreliable. \nHe asked the police officer to take him to a hospital for a blood-alcohol test, but the officer \nrefused. (Tr. 15.) He testified that he believed he has a \u201cconstitutional right to have a \nblood-alcohol test.\u201d (Tr. 32.) Applicant notified his probation officer about this incident. (Tr. \n32.) His trial on the DWI and breathalyzer refusal was pending and not imminent when \nthe record of his security clearance hearing closed. \nWithout objection from either party, I have taken administrative notice of the \n\u201cimplied consent\u201d law applicable to the jurisdiction in which the breathalyzer refusal \noccurred. (State Code \u00a718.2-268.3). This law provides that a first breathalyzer refusal is \na civil offense, but a second or subsequent refusal is a misdemeanor if it occurs within \nten years after a conviction of certain offenses, including DWI. \nCharacter Evidence \nA coworker and former college classmate who has worked with Applicant for about \nsix years considers him an extremely dependable and dedicated employee who goes \nbeyond what is expected. (AX B.) A friend who has been Applicant\u2019s barber for more than \n20 years describes him as loyal, dependable, a good man, and a proud father. (AX C.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file \nincome tax returns or pay income taxes) is not applicable, because the delinquent taxes \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l were personal property taxes and not income taxes. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is potentially applicable to some of Applicant\u2019s medical debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h, but Applicant did not submit any evidence that they \nwere unusual expenses beyond routine medical care, except for a hernia operation. \nHowever, Applicant did not identify which debt was attributable to the hernia operation. In \nany event, Applicant did not meet the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), because he submitted \nno evidence of responsible behavior. He claimed that the medical debts were paid, but \nhe submitted no evidence of payment. An applicant who claims that debts has been paid \nor otherwise resolved is expected to present documentary evidence supporting the claim. \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his delinquent debts are not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g, which have \nbeen paid. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.f, and 1.h-1.l, \nwhich Applicant claimed were paid but for which he submitted no documentary evidence \nof payment. It is not established for the wage garnishment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, because \ninvoluntary garnishment is not a good-faith effort within the meaning of this mitigating \ncondition. ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for one of the telecommunications debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.i. The SOR did not allege the account numbers and the April 2020 does not \nlist the amounts, making it impossible to determine which account was successfully \ndisputed. The two debts are probably duplicates. When the same conduct is alleged twice \nin the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in the Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005) (same debt alleged twice).Accordingly, I have resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i for \nApplicant. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.j. The \nNovember 2020 credit report reflects that the medical debt is SOR \u00b6 1.a was disputed, \nbut Applicant submitted no evidence of the basis for disputing it. He claimed that the \njudgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j was the result of identity theft, but he submitted no \nevidence to support his claim and no evidence of actions to dispute or otherwise resolve \nit. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct did not occur under \nunusual circumstances, and it is not mitigated by the passage of time. His conviction of \nassault and battery on a family member is recent, and he is still on probation for that \noffense. His breathalyzer refusal is also recent. Although his trial for a breathalyzer refusal \nand DWI is pending, his admissions at the hearing establish a breathalyzer refusal that \noccurred within ten years of a DWI conviction, which is a misdemeanor under state law.  \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the violation of a protective order alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. It is not established for the other offenses alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s breathalyzer refusal occurred after the \noriginal SOR was issued and while Applicant\u2019s hearing was pending. His conviction of \nassault and battery on a family member is recent and he is still on probation for that \noffense. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d, and 2.g under this \nguideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness\u201d. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s arrest for driving with a suspended license \nwas related to his consumption of alcohol. His license was suspended for failure to pay a \nfine. Accordingly, I conclude that the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b does not raise any \nconcern under Guideline G. The conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.g is related to \nalcohol use and is sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this \nguideline:  \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related conviction was in September 2014. His most recent \narrest for DWI was in May 2022. But for the May 2022 charges, both mitigating conditions \nwould be established. He has vehemently and repeatedly denied the most recent DWI \ncharge. He has hired an attorney and intends to contest it. \nBecause the security concerns until Guidelines F and J are not mitigated, I have \nconcluded that the interests of the national security of the United States will be best \nserved by resolving this case under Guidelines F and J and not waiting for the eventual \nresolution of the Guideline G concerns raised by the most recent DWI charge. The \noutcome of the trial on the DWI charge will not affect my decision. Accordingly, I have \nresolved SOR \u00b6 3.a for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, J, and G in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, J, \nand G, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and \ncriminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g (breathalyzer refusal): \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g (DWI): \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant borrowed the \nfunds to enable his son to attend college. (Tr. 36-37) His son graduated from college in \n2019, and then his student loans were deferred for six months. (Tr. 37) Applicant received \ndelinquency notices and contacted his son. He erroneously believed his son was paying \non the loans because his son repeatedly assured him he was paying the student loans; \nhowever, his son was apparently making payments on different student loans.

(Tr. 39, 41) The D. Ed. extended the student-loan payment pause through \nAugust 31, 2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a \nsuspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted \nloans.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nId. (internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

Feb. 17, 2017)). Even if he paid the delinquent \nstudent-loan debts after receipt of the SOR, this would not automatically mitigate security \nconcerns. \n[T]he timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not threatened. \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd.

Oct. 9, 2015). \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make more progress sooner in \nthe resolution of his four student-loan debts. There is insufficient assurance that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish \nmitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 64-year-old telecommunications technician who has worked for DOD \ncontractors at the same location since 1985. In 2005, he received an associate\u2019s degree \nin electronics technology. He honorably served in the Air Force from 1978 to 1984. He \nreceived an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and an Air Force Commendation Medal. \nHe has held a security clearance for about 40 years. There is no evidence of security \nviolations, arrests, convictions, use of illegal drugs, or abuse of alcohol.  \nApplicant\u2019s family has a history of military service to the United States. He received \nmultiple letters of commendation or appreciation, which lauded his professionalism, \nability, initiative, loyalty, devotion to duty, and contributions to mission accomplishment. \nHe loves his job and takes great pride in his work. He wants to continue to contribute to \nhis employer and his country. \nApplicant provided important mitigating information. His finances were harmed by \nseveral circumstances largely beyond his control. He mitigated all of the SOR allegations \nexcept for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant failed to provide persuasive information to explain why he was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner resolving the four student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e. He \ndid not employ reasonable and prudent actions to check on his student loans after he \nreceived notices from D. Ed. He did not show a track record of consistent payments to \naddress his student loans. His financial history raises unmitigated questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debt, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1977 \nto 1982, and served in the United States Air Force from 1982 to 2003, and reports he was \nhonorably discharged. Applicant has been married since 2005, he was previously married \nfrom 1981 to 1999. He has six children (ages 31, 26, 15, 13, and twins who are 11). \nApplicant has worked as a facility protection manager for the same employer since 2010. \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent accounts totaling approximately $49,113 \nincluding a mortgage foreclosure with a deficiency balance placed for collection \n($13,699), two charged off credit cards ($35,293), and one credit account placed for \ncollection ($121). (Item 1) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2020. He \nreported a single financial issue, the foreclosure on an investment property estimated at \n$200,000, that commenced in January 2016, and was resolved in January 2018. (Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by government investigators on various dates in May \nand June 2020. During the May 2020 interview, he explained the foreclosure was a rental \nproperty he owned after suffering financial distress when renters left the home after the \nproperty was damaged by flooding from a broken hot water heater. Applicant said he \ncould not afford to repair the property damage and that after he was unable to sell the \nproperty the bank foreclosed on, and sold the property in January 2018. He claimed the \naccount was settled in full. Applicant also acknowledged that he had been delinquent on \nthe debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.c, but reported settling those debts in full in \napproximately 2017, after completing a 30-month payment plan. Applicant attributed \nthose debts to living expenses while addressing foreclosure on his rental property. He \nacknowledged the delinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d, but said he was disputing the \ndebt with the creditor. (Item 4) \nCredit records dated April 10, 2020, November 13, 2020 and November 1, 2021 \nreflect the four delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d totaling $49,113 and \nforeclosure ($273,010) on one of Applicant\u2019s two mortgages. These records report the \nlast payment on the delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.c as September \n2015.

The deficiency balance of the mortgage was placed \nfor collection in September 2018 and the records do not reflect any payments on that \ndeficiency balance. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nIn his undated Response to the FORM, Applicant asserted several delinquent \naccounts were removed from his recent credit reports and that only one delinquent debt \nremained. He submitted two credit reports dated December 6, 2021 which include no \nreference to the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. Both credit reports reflect the \ndelinquent debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b as placed for collection in September 2018 in the \namount alleged in the SOR and no other delinquencies. One of the reports reflects \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage opened in April 2013 with regular payments through March 2018, \ndelinquent starting in April 2018, and foreclosure in March 2019. Applicant did not report \nresolving the delinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c and provided no \ndocumentary evidence of payments on any debt alleged in the SOR. (AE A, AE B, AE C) \nApplicant has provided inconsistent and contradictory responses regarding \nwhether the delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c have been resolved. \nHe reported no delinquent accounts in his SCA, claimed the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.c were resolved in approximately 2017, and denied owing the debt alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 1.b during background interviews, but in response to the SOR he admitted all three \ndebts remained delinquent in the amounts alleged. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant claimed he disputed the delinquent account alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d \nbecause this account was a double billing for a fee that had been paid. His credit records \nfrom April 2020 reflect Applicant disputed this account and credit records from November \n2020, November 2021, and December 2021 include no reference to this account. \nAlthough, Applicant failed to provide other documentary evidence, and this debt may have \nfallen off his credit report for other reasons, I have given him credit for his corroborated \nexplanation that he disputed this debt and find in his favor on SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Items 2, 4, 5, \n6, 7, AE A, AE B, AE C) \nApplicant did not provide specific evidence of his current financial budget, savings \nor expendable income. Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will \nnot be considered for disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the \napplication of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including\nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to at least 2015. Applicant \nadmitted the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. He has provided no \nevidence of payment on these debts or that the debts have been resolved. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to loss of rental income from an investment \nproperty after flooding caused by a broken water heater damaged the home. He said he \ncould not afford to repair the damages or make mortgage payments, was unable to sell \nthe property, and that the mortgagee then foreclosed on the property. He attributes other \ndelinquent debts to living expenses incurred while addressing the foreclosure. \nApplicant incurred the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. from 2015 \nthrough September 2018. He did not provide evidence that he has made any payments \non, or otherwise resolved these debts. That some of the debts have dropped off recent \ncredit reports is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution. See ISCR Case No. 14-05803 \nat 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2015)). \u201cMere evidence that debts no longer appear on credit reports is not reason to \nbelieve that they are not legitimate or that they have been satisfactorily resolved.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 16-02941 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2017) (citations omitted). His conduct casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nLost rental income due to water damage to an investment property from a broken \nhot water heater constitutes a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, Applicant \nhas produced no documentary evidence he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThere is no evidence Applicant contacted the creditors or made a payment on the \ndelinquent accounts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a or 1.c since 2015, or that he has \ncommunicated with the creditor or made any payment on the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nThere is also no evidence he has received financial counseling or has a budget. It \nremains difficult to determine why he has not verifiably attempted to resolve his delinquent \naccounts over the years, especially after the significance of them in the security clearance \neligibility process was made known to him. Despite being aware of the significance of the \ngovernment\u2019s financial concerns, Applicant failed to take appropriate action. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09- 08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). AGs \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is 62 years old, has worked as a facility protection \nmanager for the same employer since 2010, and that there is no evidence of any \nadditional delinquent accounts since 2018. I also considered that he was honorably \ndischarged in 2003 after serving approximately 26 years in the United States Armed \nForces. \nApplicant accumulated three delinquent debts totaling approximately $48,992 from \n2015 to 2018 and has not produced sufficient evidence of payment on these debts. \nApplicant admitted all three debts remained delinquent in the amounts alleged in the \nSOR. He failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and other statements are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He was born in Pakistan. He spent part of his childhood \nin the United Kingdom while his father was pursuing a graduate degree there. After \nreturning to Pakistan, Applicant graduated from an international high school in Pakistan. \nHe then earned his bachelor\u2019s degree at a university in Europe. (Answer; AE C; Tr. 37-\n40) \nApplicant studied hospitality and business management, and that was his first \ncareer after college. He began working at a hotel in Europe and then moved to the \nUnited States in 2007 at age 23 for a management training program with a major \nAmerican hotel brand. (Answer; AE C; Tr. 39-40) \nIn 2012, Applicant changed careers and began a career in banking. He joined a \nmajor U.S. bank, initially in the sales and service field. In 2016, he earned a master\u2019s \ndegree in business administration (MBA) through an executive program. Between 2012 \nand 2017, he held two jobs, one with a bank, and one with a resort. In early 2020, he \ntransitioned to investment banking. Since March 2021, he has worked for another bank \nas a licensed investment advisor. He has applied for a clearance through conditional \nemployment with a large accounting firm. He has not had a clearance before. (Answer; \nAE C, AE E; GE 1; Tr. 8, 20, 34, 81-84) \nApplicant married in Pakistan in 2008. He and his wife, a U.S. citizen, later \nmoved to the United States. He obtained permanent U.S. residency through his wife in \n2009. They separated in 2013. Applicant applied for U.S. citizenship in 2014, and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in January 2015. He and his wife divorced in 2018. They had no \nchildren. (GE 1 at 9-10, 25-26; Tr. 41-43; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Pakistan residing in the United States. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a.1) She has been a permanent U.S. resident since 2020, and she lives with \nApplicant. He described their relationship as \u201cvery close.\u201d (Answer; AE D, AE F; Tr. 19, \n24, 46-47, 50) \nApplicant\u2019s mother went to Pakistan about three months before the hearing, with \nApplicant. She still owns a home in Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s sister lives in the home also. \nApplicant estimated that the home in Pakistan is valued at several hundred thousand \nU.S. dollars. He said if he inherits the home after his mother dies, he would sell it or give \nthe home to his sister. Applicant and his mother opened a bank account in Pakistan \nafter his father died. They closed the account a year later. (Tr. 45-49, 51-52, 85, 89) \n(The date of Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s death is either 9/19/2014 (GE 1 at 27) or 2017 (Tr. 48), \nbut whichever is correct it was several years ago).  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant owns his own home in the U.S. He estimated the value at several \nhundred thousand dollars. He has significant equity in the home, and knows how much \nhe owes on the mortgage. He owns no property in Pakistan. (Tr. 43-44; AE I) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.2 alleges that Applicant has a cousin, C1, who is a citizen of Pakistan \nresiding in the United States. Applicant stated that his cousin is now a U.S. citizen, and \nhe lives in a large U.S. city with his family. Applicant speaks to this cousin a few times a \nyear. C1\u2019s parents live in Pakistan and he goes to Pakistan to visit them. (Answer; AE \nH; Tr. 24, 54-57) \nApplicant\u2019s sister, age 37, lives in Pakistan. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.1) She is not married and \nhas no children. (Tr. 85) She is a dress designer. She has visited the U.S. in the past, \nbut not recently, due to COVD-19 travel restrictions. (Tr. 25) Applicant speaks with her \nseveral times a month, and considers them to be close. His sister came to live with \nApplicant in the U.S. for a time but preferred what Applicant called the \u201cluxurious\u201d \nlifestyle she leads in Pakistan, with drivers and maids. (AE G, Tr. 57-62) \nApplicant has numerous aunts in Pakistan. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.3) He has three maternal \naunts in Pakistan. He has contact with one of them a few times a year. He has not seen \nor spoken to the other two aunts in several years. He has one paternal aunt in Pakistan \nbut they have no contact. One more maternal aunt is now a citizen and resident of the \nUnited States, as are her children, Applicant\u2019s cousins. (AE G; Tr. 38, 67-68) \nApplicant has ten maternal cousins. Five of them are citizens and residents of the \nU.S. Five of them live in Pakistan. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.4) He is close to one of his U.S. cousins \nbut has little contact with any of the others. They have some contact for holiday good \nwishes. (AE G; Tr. 68-76) \nApplicant also has Pakistani friends. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.5) Most of them live in the U.S. \nHis interaction with them is brief, and often only on birthdays. (Tr. 25) He testified about \none friend in Pakistan, S, who has a construction business, and another friend, A, who \nowns a restaurant. He saw both of them on his recent visit to Pakistan. (Tr. 76-78) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c concerns an uncle (U1) (also SOR \u00b6 1.b.2), who is a retired officer in \nthe Pakistan military. (GE 1 at 34) Applicant has limited contact with him, mostly on \nholidays and birthdays. (AE G) Applicant said U1, his late father\u2019s brother, does not get \nalong with Applicant\u2019s mother. He retired in 2005. He now lives in the family\u2019s village, \nand manages his farm. Applicant sees U1 at family events in Pakistan. (Tr. 26-27, 53-\n54, 78-79, 86-87)  \nApplicant has other uncles in Pakistan, but he has little to no contact with them. \n(Tr. 26, 64-66, 88) If one of these uncles is referenced in SOR \u00b6 1.b.2 instead of the \nretired military officer, this is not sufficiently clear. \nOn his SCA, Applicant disclosed yearly travel to Pakistan between 2012 and \n2019.

He did not see his other cousins. (Tr. 62-64) \nApplicant testified that in his current job, he has reporting and debriefing \nrequirements when he travels overseas. He has been through training and understands \nthe importance of doing so. (Tr. 20-21, 33-34) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d concerns a friend of Applicant\u2019s, an Iraqi citizen residing in the United \nStates. Applicant disclosed her on his SCA because she was a bank client at the time, \nand he wanted to be as honest as possible. They have not been in touch in \u201ca very long \ntime.\u201d (Tr. 28) They were never in a romantic relationship. He knows that she is married \nand lives in the U.S. He did not want to discuss their professional banking relationship \nout of respect for her privacy. She contacted him three months before the hearing \nseeking a copy of her recent bank statement. (Tr. 28, 29, 79-81) \nApplicant testified that he is a proud American. He loves \u201cto show that he comes \nfrom the greatest country in the world.\u201d He \u201cwould not think twice\u201d about giving his life \nfor the United States. He would not compromise its sovereignty or integrity. In working \nfor a financial institution, he understands the importance of confidentiality, as well as \nadherence to rules and regulations, including \u201cproviding no favors to anyone under any \ncircumstances.\u201d (Tr. 29-32, 35-37) He is a registered voter in his state. (AE A) \nApplicant is well-regarded at work and is considered a \u201ctop performer.\u201d (AE J) Mr. \nB, an employee of his prospective employer, also a personal friend, attested to \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S., as well as to his professional skills. Mr. B recruited \nApplicant to his prospective position. (AE J) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor, F, has known him since 2014. F attested to \nApplicant\u2019s \u201ctremendous growth\u201d both professionally and as a human being. He is a \nteam player, well-informed, a star performer, and is always willing to assist his peers \nand mentors. F has an enduring respect for Applicant\u2019s work ethic and problem-solving \nskills. (AE J) \nA personal reference, Dr. H, regards Applicant as honest, dependable, and \nrespectful. He is helpful, supportive, cheerful, reliable, and trustworthy. Applicant has \nalways been grateful for the opportunity to build his life and future in the United States. \n(AE J) \nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan): (AN I) \nPakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. The prime minister is head of \ngovernment, and the president is head of state. The country has endured direct military \nrule for nearly half of its time as an independent nation.

The United States remains concerned about the continued presence of \nterrorist and other extremist groups in Pakistan. Terrorist groups continue plotting \nattacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of \nviolence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as \nlocal military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting \ntransportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, \ntourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities. \nTerrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past. \nThe State Department\u2019s most recent human-rights report on Pakistan reflects the \nreported commission of human rights violations by elements within Pakistan and the \nPakistani government. The most serious human-rights problems in Pakistan include \nextrajudicial and targeted killings, disappearances, torture, the lack of rule of law, and \nsectarian violence. Government corruption is a serious problem, and the lack of \naccountability and failure to prosecute these abuses has led to a culture of impunity. \nIraq: (AN II) \nI have read and considered the facts set forth in AN II, concerning Iraq. The only \nallegation concerning Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq which makes those facts relevant \nhere is SOR \u00b6 1.d. SOR \u00b6 1.d concerns a banking client of Applicant\u2019s who is an Iraqi \ncitizen and U.S. resident, a woman who Applicant disclosed on his SCA out of the \nabundance of caution. As addressed in the Analysis section, below, their contact is \nlargely professional and infrequent, and not an ongoing security concern. I therefore see \nlittle reason to discuss the facts in AN II about Iraq any further. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s cousin in the United States (SOR \u00b6 1.a.2) is now a U.S. citizen.

It denotes a risk \ngreater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign \ngovernment or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s family \nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nThe serious human-rights issues, the ongoing threat of terrorism there, and the \ngovernments\u2019 inability to stem corruption in Pakistan all create a \u201cheightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d They also create \na potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(c) have been raised by the \nevidence. \nApplicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a.1) is a citizen of Pakistan, though she is also a \npermanent resident of the United States.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), \nand 7(c) all apply. \nApplicant has a sister (SOR \u00b6 1.b.1), several aunts (SOR \u00b6 1.b.3) and cousins \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.4) who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) both apply to \nthem. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) also apply to Applicant\u2019s uncle, U1, who is a retired \nPakistani military officer, as well as a citizen and resident of Pakistan.

Therefore, I find that U1 is alleged twice, and consider SOR \u00b6 1.b.2 to be \nduplicative. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.5 concerns unspecified friends of Applicant\u2019s who are citizens and \nresidents of Pakistan. Applicant testified that there are two such friends with whom he \nkeeps in some contact: S and A, both of whom he saw on recent visit to Pakistan. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply to them. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d concerns a banking client of Applicant\u2019s who is an Iraqi citizen \nresiding in the United States. They appear to have been friends at one point in time, but \ntheir limited contact is now only professional in nature, as well as infrequent. Applicant \ndisclosed the woman on his 2019 SCA out of the abundance of caution. Given the \nnature of their interaction, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) do not apply, and to the extent \nthat they do apply, SOR \u00b6 1.d is mitigated under AG \u00b6 8(c). \nI have analyzed the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \n \nApplicant has several immediate family members who are citizens and residents \nof India and has two sisters in Pakistan. In light of the administratively noticed facts \nabout Pakistan and the heightened risk shown, AG \u00b6 8(a) has limited applicability. \nApplicant lives with his mother in the United States. He visits his family in \nPakistan, specifically his sister, on a yearly basis, and speaks to her frequently. His \nsister lives in a home in Pakistan that their mother owns. It cannot be said that his \nrelationships with his immediate family members are casual. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply \nto his mother and sister. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his extended family members in Pakistan, however, are \nsignificantly less frequent. He has limited contact with his uncle, U1 (or other uncles, \nwhether specifically alleged or otherwise), with his aunts in Pakistan, and with his \ncousins there. AG \u00b6 8(c) applies to them. It also applies to his two friends in Pakistan. \nHe saw them on his recent visit but no more frequent contact is evident by the record \nevidence. \nThe evidence in support of AG \u00b6 8(b), however, is significant. Applicant has lived \nin the United States for many years. He owns property here and his life is here. He has \nan established career in the banking industry. This brings with it significant experience \nwith and understanding not only of rules and regulations generally, but also of the \nspecific concepts of confidentiality, privacy and the protection of sensitive information. In \naddition, he has experience in that industry with the practice and importance of briefing \nand debriefing before and after his foreign travels. These are all significant factors in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. I also had the opportunity to view Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the \nhearing and I found him to be a credible witness. Applicant also presented significant \nand strong whole-person character evidence through his reference letters. Those \nreferences all attested to Applicant\u2019s honesty, dedication, work ethic, and pride in the \nlife and opportunities he has here in the United States. While Applicant has continuing \nfamily ties to Pakistan through his mother, his sister and his yearly visits, I am \nnonetheless confident that given his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. I observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor while \nhe testified. He was an impressive and candid witness. He presented a strong case in \nmitigation and in support of his request for access to classified information. \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, and \nconsidering the whole-person factors set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d), the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s family connections to Pakistan are mitigated. \nSecurity concerns about his connections to Iraq are also resolved. The record evidence \ntherefore leaves me with no questions or doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

He purchased the marijuana from state \nlicensed dispensaries to self-medicate anxiety and focus issues, no more than two to \nthree times per year, the latest use in 2018. He used amyl nitrate (and similar formulations \nof inhalants; poppers) six to eight times a year between 2013 and 2017. He noted he had \nnot used poppers for several years, but stated his intent to do so in the future. \nApplicant disclosed he used nitrous oxide three to five times per year between \n2014 and 2020, at social gatherings and for recreational purposes.

(Item 5) Applicant confirmed his drug use as disclosed in his \nMarch 2020 SCA, but indicated he no longer intended to continue using illegal drugs in \nthe future, except for nitrous oxide, which he intended to use again, but not regularly. He \nadmitted to socializing with individuals who use illegal drugs at least twice a year. \nApplicant noted that if he were assigned to a position where the use of nitrous \noxide was prohibited, he would not use it. He claimed he is now focused on his \nprofessional life and has chosen to settle down his social life, which is why he is no longer \nusing illegal drugs. He presented no documentary evidence to show that he sought or \nreceived any medical or psychological treatment or counseling for substance abuse. He \nhas never participated in any drug counseling, treatment, or education. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017, or SEAD 4) App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \nand 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.

Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nIn reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following: \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence Memorandum \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, made it clear that state laws do \nnot authorize citizens to violate federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug.  \nChanges to state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. An individual's disregard \nof federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nin national security determinations. The adjudicative authority must determine if the use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, 50 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3343 (2008), specifically prohibits a federal agency from granting or renewing a \nclearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict, and under federal \nlaw, use of marijuana remains unlawful. (See, SEAD 4, App. B) \nExecutive Order 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace (September 25,1985) \nmandates a drug-free workplace and drug-free federal workforce, and expressly states \nthat use of illegal drugs on or off duty by federal employees in positions with access to \nsensitive information may pose a serious risk to national security and is inconsistent with \nthe trust placed in such employees as servants of the public. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, from about 1999, to June 2018. \nHe used nitrous oxide from about June 2014 to about January 2020. He used MDMA \n(molly) in about June 2018. He used amyl nitrate (poppers) with varying frequency from \nabout June 2013 to about June 2017. \nIn his 2020 SCA, Applicant stated his intent to continue using both amyl nitrates \nand nitrous oxide in the future. He told a government investigator during a 2021 interview \nthat he no longer intended to continue using illegal drugs in the future, except for nitrous \noxide, which he intended to use again, but not regularly. He also admitted to socializing \nwith individuals who use illegal drugs at least twice a year. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied any intent to use illegal drugs in the future. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse; and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions. An evaluation of \napplicable mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant has a long history of polysubstance possession and use, starting at age 18, in \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1999, until age 39, in January 2020. He socializes with individuals who use drugs at least \ntwice a year. He failed to establish that he has disassociated from his illegal substance-\nusing friends and coworkers. \nApplicant claimed he had not used marijuana after 2018, nitrous oxide after \nJanuary 2020, amyl nitrate after June 2017, and that he only used MDMA once in 2018. \nAfter stating his intent to continue using both amyl nitrates and nitrous oxide in his March \n2020 SCA, he told an investigator in June 2020 that he intended to use only amyl nitrate, \nbut not regularly. In his January 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant denied any intent to \nuse illegal drugs in the future. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s polysubstance misuse of about 21 years, his reluctance \nto forego using some of the substances, his failure to show he disassociated from his \nillegal substance-using friends, and the lack of evidence of substance abuse counseling \nor treatment, the passage of time so far is insufficient to establish that his substance \nmisuse is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s polysubstance misuse and possession cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and his ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H \nin my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under that guideline, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been working \nfor his employer since September 2019. His polysubstance misuse between 1999 and \n2020 shows lack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with federal rules and \nregulations. It raises serious questions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Considering the record as a whole, \nthe passage of time since his most recent polysubstance use is insufficient to establish \nthat his polysubstance use is unlikely to recur. The drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

His September 2022 CBR reports the loan as \u201cpays account as agreed.\u201d (Tr. \n29-30, 58-62; GE 3 at 10; AE G, AE H, AE I) At some point, the loan was transferred to \nanother creditor. (Ex. M) The loan is currently in forbearance, as noted below: \nIn March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoEd placed \nall federal student loans in forbearance and has since extended the \nstudent loan payment pause through December 31, 2022. The pause \nincludes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of \nloan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collection on defaulted \nloans. (See Federal Student Aid: https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19.) \n2. The student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b has a balance for $4,484, and was past \ndue $199, according to Applicant\u2019s June 2020 CBR. Applicant said this is a duplicate \nallegation of the loan above, and it bears the name of the new creditor for the above \nstudent loan. (Tr. 31-32; AE M) This student loan does not appear on Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 2022 CBR. It is a duplicate. \nApplicant testified that he owes about $100,000 in student loans. (Tr. 58) \nAccording to the September 2022 CBR, his student loans total $104,434. That CBR \nreports the loans as \u201cpays account as agreed\u201d and notes his last payment was in August \n2022. The $4,515 student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, is reported as having a balance of \n$4,745. It is not included in the $104,434 balance. (GE 3 at 10.) He said he has made \nminimum payments on the loans since 2006 and they have not gone into collection. He \ninitially borrowed about $70,000. As a result of his low payments, the loans have \naccumulated a substantial amount of interest. He has not made larger payments because \nhe is trying to reduce other debts. (Tr. 59-62) \n3. The $11,643 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is owed to a company for a $14,000 \npersonal loan Applicant took out in October 2017 to consolidate credit card bills and allow \nhim to make only one monthly payment. He made payments until he was laid off eight \nmonths later. According to the September 2022 CBR, the debt became delinquent in \n2019, and the last payment was in July 2021. Applicant said he set up an agreement with \nthe debt collector to make monthly payments of $120 in January 2021, and he has been \nmaking them since; however, there is no proof documenting payments since May 2021. \nThe September 2022 CBR remains the most recent information on the debt, showing an \noutstanding balance due of $11,133. (Tr. 33-39, 58; GE 3 at 8; AE I) This debt is not \nresolved. \n4. The $4,690 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was charged off in 2019. It \nwas settled and paid in February 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

The \nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-\nperson concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated about $26,779 of delinquent debt between 2018 and 2021 \nthat he was unable to resolve. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following four are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are not longstanding, but are more recent and \nattributable to the loss of his job in 2018 followed by unemployment for a year; a \nseparation from his wife around the same time; and reliance on credit cards while he was \nunemployed. He has been working since 2019, and in 2021 he resumed living with his \nwife. Similar circumstance are unlikely to recur. The evidence establishes some mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). While his unemployment and separation were circumstances beyond \nhis control, his reliance on credit cards was within his control. He did not present evidence \nthat he acted responsibly under his circumstances until November 2020, when he paid \none alleged debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nApplicant has not participated in credit or budget counseling since college. He \npaid and resolved seven debts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b for $4,690 in February 2021; 1.e for $2,711 \nin November 2020; 1.f for $1,383 in October 2022; 1.g for $675 in October 2022; 1.h for \n$289 in October 2022; 1.i for $233 in April 2021; and 1.j for $204 in October 2022. These \ntotal $10,185. He has not resolved the large $11,643 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, or the \n$201 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. These two debts total $11,844.

There is some evidence indicating that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nslowly coming under control. The evidence establishes limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(c). \nApplicant established limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) for six of the seven debts, \nas he did not initiate a good-faith effort to resolve them until after he received the SOR in \nDecember 2020 or after he participated in his October 12, 2022 hearing. He established \nfull mitigation as to the debt he paid in November 2020, after meeting with the investigator \nin August 2020 and prior to the issuance of the SOR in December 2020. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has been working for federal contractors since 2007, \nwith two periods of unemployment, the last being from 2018 to 2019. During that year of \nunemployment, he accumulated delinquent debts that totaled $26,779. During his \ninterview in July 2020, he said he intended to work out payment plans for all of his debts. \nDespite having knowledge of the government\u2019s security concerns in July 2020, he did not \ntake adequate steps to address his delinquent debts until after the SOR was issued and \nhe had attended his October 2022 hearing. Half of the alleged debt amount remains \nunresolved, despite earning a large salary since 2019. During the hearing, he did not \nexhibit a comprehensive knowledge of his delinquent debts or finances. Although he has \nmanaged to keep his student loans out of default by making minimum payments since \n2006, they continue to increase significantly due to the accrual of interest charges. At this \ntime, he has not established a reliable track record of responsibly handling his financial \nobligations. Overall, the record evidence does not resolve my concerns about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not sufficiently mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under the financial considerations guideline. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                       \n               \n                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Against Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n   Subparagraph 1.c:   \n   Subparagraphs 1.d through 1.j:       \n   Subparagraph 1.k:    \n For Applicant \n   Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Under Guideline C, the SOR cross-alleged the same facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and also alleged that Applicant used his Turkish citizenship to: purchase a home in Turkey with funds borrowed from a Turkish financial institution (SOR \u00b6 2.b); obtain employment with a Turkish company in Turkey (SOR \u00b6 2.c); qualify his children to attend a special school in Turkey (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and access the Turkish healthcare system (SOR \u00b6 2.e). Under Guideline C, it also alleged that Applicant pays about 65% of his earned income in taxes to Turkey (SOR \u00b6 2.c). In his Answer, Applicant admitted each Guideline B allegation. However, construed his response to SOR \u00b6 1.g as a denial (as discussed below). With respect to Guideline C, he denied the general concern and admitted all but one of the allegations (SOR \u00b6 2.e).

The record also contains an SF86, dated July 17, 2012, which \nwas submitted for reasons also not indicated in the record (2012 SF86). On March 12, \n2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guidelines B and C. The CAF acted under Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn July 15, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

He \nwas given an opportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, \nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on March 14, 2022, but did not respond to the FORM or object to the \nGovernment\u2019s documents contained therein. The case was assigned to me on May 25, \n2022. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. I marked and admitted Items 3 through \n5 and 7 into evidence as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, respectively. Item 6 is \nthe Government\u2019s request for administrative notice (discussed below), which I marked \nand appended to the record as Administrative Exhibit (AX I). Although GE 4 was not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, I conclude that Applicant waived any \nobjection to GE 4. The Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising \nApplicant of his right to object to the admissibility of GE 4 on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise an objection to GE 4 in \nhis response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered \nto have waived any such objection, and that GE 4 could be considered as evidence in his \ncase. \nAdministrative Notice \nThe Government requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts about \nTurkey. Those facts were extracted from official U.S. Government publications, which \nwere proffered by the Government as source documents. Without objection, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request. Two of the source documents \nproffered by the Government have been recently updated. To ensure that I consider the \nmost current political conditions in Turkey, I sua sponte appended the updated source \ndocuments to the record and have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \ntherein. For the record, the updated documents are: \n\uf0b7 VII.

Under \nGuideline C, the SOR cross-alleged the same facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and \nalso alleged that Applicant used his Turkish citizenship to: purchase a home in Turkey \nwith funds borrowed from a Turkish financial institution (SOR \u00b6 2.b); obtain employment \nwith a Turkish company in Turkey (SOR \u00b6 2.c); qualify his children to attend a special \nschool in Turkey (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and access the Turkish healthcare system (SOR \u00b6 2.e). \nUnder Guideline C, it also alleged that Applicant pays about 65% of his earned income in \ntaxes to Turkey (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted each Guideline B allegation. However, \nconstrued his response to SOR \u00b6 1.g as a denial (as discussed below). With respect to \nGuideline C, he denied the general concern and admitted all but one of the allegations \n(SOR \u00b6 2.e). However, I also construed his response to SOR \u00b6 2.b as a denial (as \ndiscussed below). \nApplicant, age 43, is a U.S. citizen by birth. He obtained his Turkish citizenship in \nSeptember 2013, which he continues to maintain as a dual U.S - Turkish citizen. His wife \nis a Turkish citizen by birth and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Her \napplication for that status was sponsored by Applicant in 2003. Applicant and his wife \nwere married in Turkey in December 2001. Their three children, ages 9, 17, and 19, are \ndual U.S - Turkish citizens. The 17-year-old was born in the United States (in May 2005), \nand the other two children in Turkey. His wife\u2019s and children\u2019s resident and citizenship \nstatuses were alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. In his Answer, he admitted the allegation and \nasserted that all three of his children plan to attend college in the United States. (GE 1, \n2, 4) \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force upon his graduation from high school in \nDecember 1997. He served on active duty until he medically retired in April 2005, due to \nservice-related injuries. While on active duty, he was stationed in Turkey from 2000 \nthrough 2005 (he was in England from 1997 through 2000). Applicant earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2011 from an online U.S. university he attended from May 2009 \nthrough May 2011. His current U.S. defense contractor employer is sponsoring his \npending application for a trustworthiness determination. (GE 1, 2, 4) \nApplicant has lived and worked in Turkey since 2000, except for the period from \nMarch 2005 until May 2008, when he lived and worked in the United States. He has \nresided with his wife and children in Turkey since May 2008. Besides referencing the birth \nof their child in the United States in May 2005, the record did not address whether his \nwife and children resided with him in the United States between March 2005 and May \n2008, or whether he resided with his wife and children in Turkey prior to March 2005. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 2.a alleged: \u201cYou applied for citizenship in Turkey and became a dual \ncitizen of Turkey and the United States in about September 2013.

He volunteered for five months beginning in \nApril 2005 for a U.S. healthcare company and then worked as its director of sales and \nmarketing until May 2007, when he left to find a job closer to his residence. He then \nworked as a quality control dispatcher for a U.S. delivery carrier from May 2007 through \nMay 2008, when he left to pursue a job opening at his former duty station in Turkey. Upon \nhis return to Turkey in May 2008, he was unemployed until January 2009 while waiting \nfor his contract to begin with the Turkish contractor for whom he worked as an assistant \nbulk storage superintendent until January 2014, when his contract ended. The record \nindicated that, although the contractor for whom he worked was a Turkish entity, his \ncontract supported the U.S. Air Force base. He was unemployed again from January \n2014 until March 2014 while waiting for his contract, also in support of the U.S. Air Force \nbase, to begin with his current U.S. defense contractor employer. During those two \nperiods of unemployment, he was financially supported by his U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA) disability income. (GE 1, 2, 4) \nWhen asked on his 2014 and 2016 SF86s how he acquired his Turkish citizenship, \nApplicant answered: \nMy wife is Turkish and I have lived and worked in Turkey for approx. 10 \nyears. During my last DOD contract I was told [by a person or entity not \nindicated in the record] to get a Turkish citizenship because it would be \neasier than always applying for a work permit.  \nHe also stated that he planned to renounce his Turkish citizenship when he returned to \nthe United States after completing \u201call [of his] work overseas.\u201d He further explained: \u201cWith \nchildren in Turkish school and getting credit for buying house/car I need to have a Turkish \nID number.\u201d (GE 1, 2) \nApplicant was interviewed twice (in May and June 2019) in connection with the \nbackground investigation apparently prompted by his 2016 SF86. During his May 2019 \ninterview, he stated that he obtained his Turkish citizenship so that he could get a job in \nTurkey to supplement his VA disability income, which was insufficient to meet his \nexpenses; and to allow him to work in Turkey without having to obtain work permits. He \nmaintained that he had only one obligation associated with his Turkish citizenship: to pay \n65% of his earned income in Turkish taxes. With respect to the rights and privileges of \nhis Turkish citizenship, he stated that it afforded him access to the Turkish healthcare \nsystem and the ability to own land in Turkey; and that, without it, his children would not \nbe able to attend the special Turkish school in which they were enrolled. He asserted that, \nwhile his loyalty is to the United States, he was unwilling to renounce his Turkish \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncitizenship because doing so would preclude him from being able to work as a disabled \nveteran in Turkey. He also stated that he would not renounce his citizenship because he \nwould not be able to own any land there. He explained that he had a house that he had \nbeen paying for that was in his brother-in-law\u2019s name, but would soon be in Applicant\u2019s \nname. (GE 4 at 5) \nLater during Applicant\u2019s May 2019 interview, he acknowledged that he owned his \nhome in Turkey, which he bought from his brother-in-law for US $85,000 in late 2018. He \nexplained that he was waiting for his brother-in-law, who then resided outside of Turkey, \nto return to Turkey to switch the house over to Applicant\u2019s name. During his June 2019 \ninterview, he stated that even though he paid for it, his house is not in Applicant\u2019s name. \nHe explained that in Turkey, because you build on top of other houses, he built his house \non top of his brother-in-law\u2019s house. He also stated that even though, technically, his \nbrother-in-law owns the land, his brother-in-law would not be able to sell Applicant\u2019s home \nwithout Applicant\u2019s signature. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleged: \u201cYou purchased a home in Turkey for \nabout $85,000 USD in about 2018. You used money borrowed from a Turkish financial \ninstitution to purchase your home.\u201d Although he admitted that allegation, he also asserted \nin the accompanying explanation that: \u201cI did not purchase/buy my house I built and added \nto the upstairs of my brother-in-law\u2019s house. The house belongs to my brother-in-law.\u201d \nThus, as previously indicated, I construed his answer to SOR \u00b6 1.g as a denial. (GE 4 at \n5, 9) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleged: \u201cYou used your Turkish citizenship to purchase a home in \nTurkey in about 2018. You used your Turkish citizenship to borrow money from a Turkish \nfinancial institution to enable you to purchase your home.\u201d Although he admitted that \nallegation, the accompanying explanation concerned solely the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.c and was not responsive to the facts in SOR \u00b6 2.b. Thus, as previously indicated, I \nconstrued his answer to SOR \u00b6 2.b as a denial, particularly in light of the explanation \naccompanying his response to SOR \u00b6 1.g.  \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2014 and 2016 SF86s, he reported that he has been eligible to \nreceive medical benefits in Turkey since January 2009. He explained \u201cI worked for a \nTurkish contractor and I paid into the SSK system, my family and I are eligible to use the \nTurkish government hospitals . . . I still receive it and I will receive it in my next job.\u201d SOR \n\u00b6 2.e alleged: \u201cYou used your Turkish citizenship to obtain access to the Turkish \nhealthcare system for you and your family.\u201d In his Answer, he denied the allegation and \nasserted: \n[Y]es I do have Turkish socialized health care [sic] that comes with paying \ntaxes in Turkey. I would not have socialized healthcare if I did not have a \njob and pay taxes. I do not use this healthcare as I have TRICARE and my \nfamily I are seen at a Network Facility in . . . Turkey. If I were to go to a \nTurkish Government Hospital, then yes I would have insurance because I \npay taxes. (GE 1 at 38-39; GE 2 at 37-38) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleged: \u201cYou used your Turkish citizenship to obtain employment with \na Turkish company in Turkey.

He also stated that his \nemployer pays a Turkish company \u201cfor [him] to pay a progressive tax that ends up being \n65% at the end of the year.\u201d He stated that he maintains a U.S. bank account, but the \nrecord did not indicate its balance. He was not sure why his employer did not direct \ndeposit his paycheck into his U.S. bank account, but suspected that it may relate to his \nobligation to pay taxes in order to live and work in Turkey. (GE 4 at 6) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s May 2019 interview, he disclosed that he maintains a loan, bank \naccount, and credit cards in Turkey because he lives there. During his June 2019 \ninterview, he stated that he had maintained only one bank account in Turkey since about \n2014, with a balance of approximately US $15,000. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleged: \u201cYou maintain a \nbank account in Turkey valued at about $15,000 USD. You have credit card accounts \nissued by a Turkish bank.\u201d In his Answer, he admitted the allegation and explained: \u201cI do \nhave a bank account and it is where I receive my check for the job I need this \n[trustworthiness determination] for.\u201d (GE 4 at 5, 9) \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2016 SF86, he reported that he had owned a car in Turkey since \nJanuary 2014 with an estimated value of US $20,179. He indicated that he was still in \npossession of that car during his May 2019 interview. Because this car was not alleged \nin the SOR, I will consider it only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person. During his \nJune 2019 interview, he indicated that he no longer owns a car in the United States as he \ngave it to his grandparents before he returned to Turkey in 2008. His U.S. car was \neventually repossessed after his grandparents failed to make the payments, as promised, \non the loan for the car. (GE 1 at 37-38; GE 4 at 5, 8) \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2014 and 2016 SF86s, he reported that his U.S. income tax return \nwas audited by the IRS in 2013. He stated that he learned from the IRS that he was not \nentitled to the earned income tax credit because he works overseas. He also stated that \nhe set up a payment plan with the IRS and his U.S. state tax authority to repay the earned \nincome credit through his \u201cfuture taxes.\u201d He estimated the amount owed as US $5,000. \nHe explained that the reason he applied the earned income credit on his tax return was \nbecause he was \u201ctold\u201d to do so (by a person or entity not indicated in the record). During \nhis May 2019 interview, in reference to the 2013 IRS audit, he stated that his employer \nwrote a letter on his behalf to the IRS and his U.S. state tax authority stating that he has \nTurkish taxes taken from his paycheck.

His stepmother is a Brazilian citizen by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen. They \nall reside in the United States. His father-in-law is deceased. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, \nwhich Applicant admitted, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a resident citizen of Turkey. She is \n78 years old and a citizen of Turkey by birth. She lives in Turkey next door to Applicant. \nHe has daily contact with her. Since 2008, he has provided her with financial support of \nabout US $400 per month by paying all of her bills. Because she is unable to pay her own \nbills, he intends to continue providing this support. Applicant reported no employer for his \nmother-in-law on his 2014 and 2016 SF86s and stated that she was not \u201caffiliated with a \nforeign government, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence \nservice.\u201d (GE 1 at 34-35; GE 2 at 35-36; GE 4 at 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, which Applicant admitted, alleged that his brother-in-law is a resident \ncitizen of Turkey. The record otherwise contains scant details about his brother-in-law, \nincluding to whom he is married, his employment, and any affiliation with a foreign \ngovernment, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence \nservice. Despite having indicated that his brother-in-law lived outside of Turkey for at least \nsome period of time, he admitted the allegation without explanation in his Answer. \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2014 and 2016 SF86s, he reported that neither he nor his wife had, \nwithin the prior seven years, close or continuing contacts with any other foreign nationals. \nHowever, on his 2014 SF86, he listed a friend (A), who resided in Turkey, as one of his \nfour references. He also referred to this friend as a neighbor. A was not otherwise \ndiscussed in the record so his citizenship status, employment, and possible connection \nto a foreign government are unknown. During his May 2019 interview, Applicant reported \ntwo foreign contacts that he described as coworkers who were resident citizens of Turkey. \nHe had known one coworker (B), who is also the godfather to one of his children, since \n2015. He had known the other coworker (C) since 2018. He reported daily contact with B \nand C, and that both were employed by the U.S. Air Force with no foreign government \naffiliations. Another name (D) was mentioned during a follow up call with the investigator \nafter his May 2019 interview. However, the record was not clear as to whether the \nreferenced name was an inadvertent misspelling of one of the aforementioned persons \nor another foreign contact. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleged: \u201cYour two friends are citizens and residents \nof Turkey. One friend is Godfather to one of your children.\u201d In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted the allegation and reiterated that both work for the U.S. Air Force.

In presidential and \nparliamentary elections in 2018, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \nobservers expressed concern regarding restrictions on media reporting and the campaign \nenvironment, including the jailing of a presidential candidate that restricted the ability of \nopposition candidates to compete on an equal basis and campaign freely. \nThe friendship between the United States and Turkey dates back to 1831, when \nthe United States established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. The United \nStates condemned the July 15, 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, and continues to emphasize \nthe importance of the Turkish government\u2019s adherence to policies and actions that build \npublic trust in the country\u2019s democratic institutions and the rule of law, as well as upholding \nhuman rights commitments. Turkey is an important U.S. security partner, and has been \na valued North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally since 1952.  \nOn December 14, 2020, the United States imposed sanctions on the Republic of \nTurkey\u2019s Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB) pursuant to Section 231 of the \nCountering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for knowingly \nengaging in a significant transaction with Russia\u2019s main arms export entity by procuring \nthe S-400 surface-to-air missile system. The United States made clear to Turkey at the \nhighest levels and on numerous occasions that its purchase of the S-400 system would \nendanger the security of U.S. military technology and personnel and provide substantial \nfunds to Russia\u2019s defense sector, as well as Russian access to the Turkish armed forces \nand defense industry. Turkey nevertheless decided to move ahead with the procurement \nand testing of the S-400, despite the availability of alternative, NATO-interoperable \nsystems to meet its defense requirements. This decision resulted in Turkey\u2019s suspension \nand pending removal from the global F-35 Joint Strike Fighter partnership.  \nTurkey continues its efforts to defeat terrorist organizations both inside and outside \nits borders, including the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), the Revolutionary People\u2019s \nLiberation Party/Front, and ISIS.

However, \nTurkey is a source and transit country for foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) seeking to join \nISIS and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, as well as for FTFs who seek to \ndepart Syria and Iraq. Moreover, the PKK continues to conduct terrorist attacks in Turkey \nand against Turkish interests outside of Turkey including by taking hostages. In 2020, the \nPKK and its affiliates claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a the\u202fGurbulak\u202fcustoms \ngate with\u202fIran that killed two Turkish Customs officials, a suicide bomber that struck a \nnatural gas pipeline near the Turkish-Iranian border, taking the pipeline offline for months, \nand a bombing in\u202fMardin\u202fprovince that temporarily disabled\u202fan oil pipeline running from \nIraq to Turkey. Turkey has a\u202fbroad definition of terrorism that includes so-called crimes \nagainst constitutional order and\u202finternal and external security of the state, which the \ngovernment regularly used to\u202fcriminalize the exercise of freedom of expression and \npeaceful assembly.\u202f\u202f\nSignificant human rights issues exist in Turkey including credible reports of: \narbitrary killings; suspicious deaths of persons in custody; forced disappearances; torture; \narbitrary arrest and continued detention of tens of thousands of persons, including \nopposition politicians and former members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, human \nrights activists, and employees of the U.S. Mission, for purported ties to \u201cterrorist\u201d groups \nor peaceful legitimate speech; political prisoners, including elected officials; politically \nmotivated reprisal against individuals located outside the country, including kidnappings \nand transfers without due process of alleged members of the Gulen movement; significant \nproblems with judicial independence; support for Syrian opposition groups that \nperpetrated serious abuses in conflict, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers; \nsevere restrictions on freedom of expression, the press, and the internet, including \nviolence and threats of violence against journalists, closure of media outlets, and arrests \nor criminal prosecution of journalists and others for criticizing government policies or \nofficials, censorship, site blocking, and criminal libel laws; severe restriction of freedoms \nof assembly, association, and movement, including overly restrictive laws regarding \ngovernment oversight of nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations; \nsome cases of refoulement of refugees; serious government harassment of domestic \nhuman rights organizations; gender-based violence; crimes involving violence targeting \nmembers of national/racial/ethnic minority groups; and crimes involving violence against \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons. \nThe Turkish government took limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish \nmembers of the security forces and other officials accused of human rights abuses; and \nimpunity remained a problem. The government took limited steps to investigate \nallegations of high-level corruption. Clashes between security forces and the Kurdistan \nWorkers\u2019 Party terrorist organization and its affiliates continued and resulted in the injury \nor death of security forces, terrorists, and civilians. The government did not release \ninformation on efforts to investigate or prosecute personnel for wrongful or inadvertent \ndeaths of civilians linked to counterterrorism operations. \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution when \ntraveling to Turkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions.

Security forces have detained \ntens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, for alleged affiliations with \nterrorist organizations based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be \npolitically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to travel bans that prevent them \nfrom departing Turkey. \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \n(Directive, \u00a7 3.2) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust to support a DOD \ncontract, an administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nin the AG. (Directive, Enclosure 2). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthe guidelines in a commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable \ninformation, in arriving at a fair and impartial decision. \nIn addition to the guidelines, the Directive sets forth procedures that must be \nfollowed in trustworthiness adjudications. The Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to establish his or her eligibility for a public trust position. (Directive, Enclosure \n3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15). The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe general concern under this AG is set out in \u00b6 6, as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nHaving considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7, I find the \nfollowing potentially relevant: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nAlthough a longtime friend to the United States with shared interests in \ncounterterrorism, there is a heightened risk associated with Turkey given its human rights \nviolations and the terrorist activity that occurs within its borders. There is also additional \nheightened risk established in this case given the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts and connections to Turkey. His contact with close family and friends who are \nresident citizens of Turkey is sufficient on its own to establish disqualification under this \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguideline. The fact that Applicant is a citizen of Turkey, resides in Turkey with his wife \nand children, maintains assets in Turkey, and voted as a Turkish citizen in a Turkish \nelection, serves to further exacerbate the concern. The general concern set forth in AG \u00b6 \n6 and the specific disqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 7 (a), (b), (e), and (f) are \nestablished. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged that Applicant\u2019s \u201cmother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens \nand residents of Turkey.\u201d However, Applicant reported his father-in-law as deceased on \nhis 2014 and 2016 SF86s, which he also affirmed in his Answer. Accordingly, I find that \nportion of SOR \u00b6 1.d referencing Applicant\u2019s father-in-law in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s home in Turkey are \nconfounded by inconsistencies in the record. The record established that Applicant built \nthe home in which he resides with his family in Turkey. As alleged in the first sentence of \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, the record also established that, in about 2018, Applicant purchased that \nhome from his brother-in-law for US $85,000. Although Applicant indicated in his 2014 \nand 2016 SF86s that being able to access credit for buying a house was a benefit of his \nTurkish citizenship, the record did not establish that he used money borrowed from a \nTurkish financial institution to purchase the home as alleged in the second sentence of \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. While Applicant disclosed that he maintained a loan in Turkey during his May \n2019 interview, he did not indicate for what purpose the loan was taken, nor did he \nmention any loan associated with the purchase of his home from his brother-in-law. \nAccordingly, I find the second sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.g in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHaving considered all of the factors that could mitigate the concern under AG \u00b6 8 \nin light of the record evidence, I find the following potentially relevant: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplication of the AG is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an \nacknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that \ncould be important to a loved one, such as a family member. (ISCR Case No. 08-10025 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). Family relationships can involve matters of influence or \nobligation. (ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003). As a matter of common \nsense and human experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of \naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s marital \nrelationship provides a conduit for susceptibility to foreign influence because of the \nvulnerabilities associated with his in-laws that may pass to him through his wife. (ISCR \nCase No. 03-24144 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005). \nThe fact that Applicant built a life for himself and his family in Turkey, after serving \nthe U.S. military there, is not alone a security concern. The Guideline B concern arises \nfrom the nature of the country involved. Due to the human rights and terrorism issues \ndiscussed above, Turkey invokes a heavy burden of persuasion to prove mitigation. \nApplicant has not met his burden given the extent of his family ties and personal \nconnections to Turkey. \nAlthough his parents, stepparents, and siblings reside in the United States, \nApplicant is susceptible to foreign influence due to his ties to family and friends who are \ncitizen residents of Turkey. These ties alone are sufficient to preclude mitigation under \nGuideline B. However, there are additional vulnerabilities triggered by the extent of his \npersonal connections to Turkey, including that: 1) he and his immediate family have \nresided consistently in Turkey since 2008; 2) he maintains all but one of his assets in \nTurkey, including his home; 3) he maintains only one asset (a bank account of unknown \nvalue) in the United States; 4) he exclusively pays Turkish taxes, and not U.S. taxes. \nApplicant\u2019s Turkish citizenship alone does not serve as a disqualifying factor under \nthis guideline. However, the fact that his children attend a special school dependent upon \nhis Turkish citizenship; and that he obliged a request to vote in a local Turkish election as \na Turkish citizen create potential conflicts of interest that undermine mitigation. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s future plans to return to the United States and then \nrenounce his Turkish citizenship; and for his children to return to the United States for \ncollege. However, these are prospective in nature and do not suffice to mitigate his current \nsituation. I have considered the personal sacrifice and loyalty associated with Applicant\u2019s \nservice to the U.S. Air Force, on active duty and as a contractor. However, given the \nextent of his current family ties and personal connections to Turkey, I find that it cannot \nbe reasonably expected that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) through (c) and (f) are not established. AG \u00b6 8 (d) is not \nestablished because he is no longer in Turkey on active duty with the U.S. military. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline C: Foreign Preference \nFor the reasons discussed in connection with SOR \u00b6 1.g above, I find SOR \u00b6 2.b \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. Moreover, the record did not establish that his Turkish citizenship \nwas required for the purchase of his home from his brother-in-law. Nevertheless, I have \nconsidered his home in Turkey in the context of evaluating mitigation and the whole \nperson. \nAs alleged in the second sentence of SOR \u00b6 2.c, the record established that \nApplicant pays the government of Turkey about 65% of his earned income. However, the\nrecord did not similarly establish that he used his Turkish citizenship to obtain\nemployment with a Turkish company in Turkey, as alleged in the first sentence of SOR \u00b6\n2.c. Applicant was a U.S. citizen at the time he obtained employment with his Turkish\nemployer. Moreover, the record did not establish that he was required to hold Turkish \ncitizenship in order to obtain employment in Turkey. Accordingly, I find the first sentence\nof SOR \u00b6 2.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \n \n \n \nHaving considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 10 in connection \nwith the facts alleged under Guideline C that were established by the record, only one is \npotentially relevant: (a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country. In \norder to determine whether AG 10(a) is established, further analysis is required as set out \nin AG \u00b6 9 (the general concern), as follows: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. national \ninterests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a \nU.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying without an \nobjective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. The same is \ntrue for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or privilege of foreign citizenship \nand any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship. \nThe record reveals various ways Applicant has indicated a preference for Turkey \nover the United States, including by choosing to obtain a Turkish citizenship as a U.S. \ncitizen by birth; and by using that citizenship to enable his children to attend a special \nschool and to vote in a Turkish election. He maintains all but one asset (of unknown value) \nin Turkey. He exclusively pays Turkish taxes, and not U.S. taxes. He has consistently \nresided in Turkey for most of his adult life. His wife and children reside in Turkey. He and \nhis family have access to the Turkish healthcare system. These facts create a conflict with \nthe U.S. national interests due to the nature of the country involved. \nHaving considered all of the factors that could mitigate the concern under AG \u00b6 11 \nin light of the record evidence, I find the following potentially relevant: \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; \n(e) the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do not \npresent a national security concern; and \n(f) the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, entity, or \nassociation that poses a low national security risk. \nDue to the nature of the country involved, neither AG \u00b6 11(a) nor 11(f) are \nestablished. Although Turkey is an ally, its human rights violations and the terrorist activity \nthat occurs within its borders create a level of risk that cannot be considered \u201clow.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 11(e) is established in reference to Applicant and his family\u2019s access to \nTurkish healthcare. The fact that Applicant maintains health insurance primarily through \nTRICARE alleviates the concern with the access he also maintains to the Turkish \nhealthcare system. Thus, I find SOR \u00b6 2.e in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant articulated a plan to renounce his Turkish citizenship upon the \ncompletion of his work in Turkey and return to the United States. However, he also \nexpressly stated an unwillingness to renounce his Turkish citizenship until then. He has \nnot indicated any imminent plans to return to the United States or to terminate his \nemployment in Turkey. Thus, AG \u00b6 11(c) is not established. \nThe record established that Applicant exercised the rights and benefits of his \nTurkish citizenship only with respect to his children\u2019s school and by voting in a Turkish \nelection. Of the facts alleged under Guideline C that have not been found in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor, there remain the following: his dual U.S - Turkish citizenship; the fact that he, his \nwife, and three children have resided in Turkey since 2008; the fact that he pays 65% of \nhis earned income to Turkey; and the fact his children attend a special school dependent \nupon his Turkish citizenship. \nThe Government did not allege Applicant\u2019s voting in a Turkish election under \nGuideline C. Moreover, voting in a foreign election was an expressly articulated \ndisqualifying factor in the previous version of the AG promulgated in 2006 (2006 AG \u00b6 \n10(a)(7)), but not in the current version of the AG (2017 AG). However, I find that the facts \nand circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s voting in a Turkish election undermine \nmitigation. \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not, by itself, a disqualifying condition. However, \nApplicant chose to obtain Turkish citizenship when it was not required for his employment \nor otherwise; reside in Turkey with his wife and children for the last 14 years; purchase a \nhome in Turkey; use his citizenship status to afford his children the opportunity to attend \na Turkish school and to oblige a request to vote in a Turkish election; and pay taxes to \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTurkey and not the United States. By taking these actions, in light of the country involved, \nhe has created a potential conflict with U.S. national security interests. There remains a \nrisk that Applicant will make decisions to protect his interests in Turkey that are harmful \nto the interests of the United States. Accordingly, Applicant has not met his burden \nmitigate the foreign preference concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person \nanalysis and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have weighed the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and C, and evaluated all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person and the nature of the country involved. I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by his family ties and \npersonal connections to Turkey, or his actions indicating a preference for Turkey over the \nUnited States. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for a public \ntrust position. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the amended SOR, as required by \nSection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d (mother-in-law): \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d (father-in-law): \nFor Applicant \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g (first sentence): \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g (second sentence): \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c (first sentence): \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c (second sentence): \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.

The second transcript (TR-2) was \nreceived on May 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.~1.c. He denied SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since 2005. He has held a security clearance \nsince 2005. He is married, and has two adult children. (TR-2 at page 9 line 8 to page 11 \nline 7.) \nThe allegations will be discussed in chronological order: \n1.a. Applicant admits that in 2007, about 15 years ago, he made a copy and sent \na document that contained secret and/or sensitive information which, prohibits it from \nbeing copied and distributed. (TR-2 at page 12 line 3 to page 13 line 20, and GX 5 at \npage 6.) \n1.b. Applicant admits that also in 2007, he emailed a document to a co-worker \nthat contained sensitive information.

However, he was found to be \nculpable, and received subsequent training from his employer. (GXs 3~5, and AppXs A \nand B at page 2.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information \nis set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 34. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nApplicant had five incidents that involved the possible compromise of classified \nor sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training \nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s indiscretions regarding the handling of classified or sensitive \ninformation occurred over a period of ten years, from 2007 up to and including 2016. \nHowever, he has had an unblemished record for the last six years since May of 2016. \nThis is evidenced by the letters of recommendation of two former managers (AppX I), \nand by his recent performance reviews (AppX D). So much time has passed since his \nlast alleged indiscretion, that I find they are unlikely to recur. Handling Protected \nInformation is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \na distinguished history of working in the defense industry. He performs well at his job. \n(AppXs A-2 and B-2.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Handing Protected Information security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.e: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant \nfiled a response on March 7, 2022.  On March 14, 2022, the case was assigned to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 64-year-old married man. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982 and \na master\u2019s degree in 1987. Since 2007, he has been working for a company in the avionics \nindustry that he co-founded. (Item 3 at 12) \nApplicant failed to file his federal tax returns from 2009 to 2019, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.a, and he owes a $28,551 delinquency for tax year 2009, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.c. As of March 2021, Applicant had two delinquent consumer accounts, \ncollectively totaling approximately $10,000, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the struggles of his business, which he \ncontends generated minimal income over the years. As his business struggled, he turned \nto credit cards to make ends meet. (Item 4 at 7) He attributes his failure to file his income \ntax returns to his inability to manage their complexity. (Item 4 at 13) He contends that he is \npaying the 2009 delinquency through a payment plan (Item 4 at 11), but provided no \nsupporting documentation. \nPer SOR subparagraph 1.b, Applicant did not file state tax returns for tax years 2009 \nthrough 2019. In Applicant\u2019s home state, the only income subject to taxation is that which \nderives from dividends and interests from bonds and debt notes. (State X \u00a777.4) Applicant \ncontends that during the years that he struggled financially, he did not have enough \ninvestment income, as defined under the state statute, to meet the threshold for filing state \nincome tax returns. \nThe consumer debt in subparagraph 1.d totals $3,816. By April 2021, Applicant had \nsatisfied this debt through monthly payments of $243. (Reply to FORM at 5) \nAs of February 2022, the balance of the debt set forth in subparagraph 1.e, was \n$6,833. (Reply at 1) Applicant contends that he has been satisfying this debt through a \npayment plan since November 2020. (Reply at 1) He provided proof of one payment made \nin February 2022. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility to work in a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworhthiness decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file federal income tax returns from 2009 to 2019, and his outstanding \ndelinquency for tax year 2009, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual, federal, state, or satisfy local income tax returns, or failure to pay \nannual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder state law where Applicant lives, citizens are only required to pay a percentage \nof their state income tax that is comprised of interest and dividend income, not ordinary \nincome. Given Applicant\u2019s financial struggles, his contention that he did not generate \nenough interest or dividend income to meet the tax filing requirement is credible. I resolve \nSOR subparagraph 1.b in his favor. \nAs for the remaining SOR allegations, the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant contends that his financial problems stemmed from his struggling \nbusiness, but did not elaborate. He provided no proof that he is paying the 2009 federal \nincome tax delinquency, and scant evidence that he is satisfying the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.e. Under these circumstances, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThere is insufficient whole-person information on file that I could conceivably weigh \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

On February 11, 2022, I was assigned \nthe case. On March 18, 2022, DOHA issued a notice of video teleconference hearing, \nscheduling it for April 20, 2022. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I received four Government exhibits, marked \nand identified as Government Exhibit (GE) 1 through GE 4, one exhibit of Applicant\u2019s \nmarked and identified as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, and I considered the testimony of \nApplicant. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open at the close of the hearing until May \n18, 2022 to allow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the allotted time, Applicant \nsubmitted three additional exhibits, marked and incorporated into the record as AE B \nthrough AE D. I did not extend the record any further. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nApril 28, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year old married man with two adult children and one adult \nstepchild. (Tr. 18) A previous marriage ended in divorce. Applicant is a veteran of the U.S. \nNavy, serving from 1994 to 2010. He retired honorably. (GE 1 at 24) Applicant works for a \ncontractor as a management analyst. (Tr. 19) He is tasked with providing administrative \nsupport for senior government employees, military members, and other government \ncontractors. (Tr. 19) He has been employed in this line of work since retiring from the Navy. \nAfter retiring from the Navy, Applicant matriculated to college and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. (GE 1 at 14) He has held a security clearance for 32 years. (Tr. \n21) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to his supervisor, Applicant \ndemonstrates \u201ca keen sense of security awareness, not only ensuring the proper \nsafeguarding of information by his [sic] self, but by raising the awareness of all in [their] \ndivision.\u201d (Answer at 13) \nSince 2009, Applicant has incurred approximately $25,000 of delinquent federal and \nstate income taxes, and approximately $28,000 of delinquent consumer debts. The \ndelinquent federal income taxes stem from tax years 2009 to 2019, and are alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h. Subparagraph 1.i sets forth Applicant\u2019s failure to file his \nstate income tax returns. The remainder of the allegations concern Applicant\u2019s consumer \ndebts. \nApplicant contends his income tax problems related to problems managing his side \nbusiness. Because he \u201cwasn\u2019t business-smart at all,\u201d he hired his brother to file his income \ntax returns. (Tr. 34) Initially, \u201ceverything was fine.\u201d (Tr. 35) Then, some years after starting \nthe business the IRS audited his finances. Applicant did not save many of his receipts \nwhen he purchased inventory, and lost others when he relocated in 2016.

(GE 2 at 7; Tr. 26) At or about this time, \nhis son was incarcerated, leaving Applicant and Applicant\u2019s wife to care for the grandson, \nand increasing household expenses. (Tr. 26) Strapped for cash, Applicant had to prioritize \nwhich debt to pay and which debt to not pay. (GE 2 at 7) Applicant acknowledges that \nsome his financial problems were due to irresponsible spending. (GE 2 at 3) Specifically, \nhe \u201ctook on probably more debt than [he] should have[,]. . . [and] didn\u2019t make smart \ndecisions money-wise.\u201d (Tr. 32) \nIn 2018, Applicant contacted the IRS and negotiated a payment plan to satisfy the \nfederal tax delinquencies alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h. Between February \n2018 and April 2022, he made 19 payments, totaling approximately $3,540. (AE A and AE \nB) Approximately $23,000 remains outstanding. \nApplicant has yet to file his state tax returns from 2012 to 2018, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.i. (Tr. 45) However, he has been making monthly payments ranging \nbetween $80 and $137 since February 2021 through a payment plan. (AE C; Tr. 46) He \ncontends that he began making payments before February 2021, but was unable to \nsubstantiate this contention before the close of the record. The amount owed is unknown \nfrom the record. Applicant was making payments under a previous payment plan in 2013, \nbut \u201clet it lapse\u201d in 2016 (Tr. 47) Although he is making payments towards the satisfaction \nof his state tax debts, he has yet to file his state income tax returns. (Tr. 46) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.j, totaling $17,948, is the deficiency from a car \nthat the lender repossessed. (Tr. 25, 50) The car originally belonged to Applicant\u2019s son. \nWhen his son was incarcerated in 2016, Applicant assumed liability for payment of the car \nnote, but was unable to make them. The repossession was voluntary. (Tr. 47) The debt \nremains outstanding, and Applicant has no plans to address it until he resolves other \ndebts. (GE 2 at 8) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k is owed to another car lender. Applicant \nopened this account in 2010. (GE 2 at 10) The account became delinquent in 2017 and \nwas charged off later that year in August 2017. (GE 4 at 11) In April 2019, Applicant \ncontacted the creditor and negotiated a payment plan. (Answer at 4) He has been making \nmonthly payments, ranging from $96 to $507 since then. (Answer at 4) The current balance \nis unknown from the record. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l, totaling $604, constitutes a delinquent \nmaintenance fee from a timeshare property that Applicant purchased in 2017. \n(Supplemental Answer at 3) He fell behind on these fees in 2019. He contends that he \nsatisfied the delinquent fee and is trying to sell the property to no avail. (Tr. 28) He stopped \nmaking payments in January 2022, anticipating that the company he had hired to get him \nout of this time share would successfully obtain his release from the time-share obligations. \n(Tr. 28) If the efforts at getting out of the time-share responsibilities fail, Applicant \u201cmay go \nback to making payments.\u201d (Tr. 29) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.m, totaling $421, is a delinquent credit card that \nApplicant opened to pay for car repairs.

(Tr. 31) \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.n, totaling $229, is a cable television service bill. \nApplicant disputed this bill, contending that the dates that the service allegedly was not \npaid do not correspond to the dates when he lived at the residence. (Tr. 31; GE 4 at 12) He \nprovided no proof substantiating the basis of his dispute. \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.o, totaling $186, is owed to an unidentified \nmedical creditor. Applicant denies this allegation contending that he was unaware of this \ndebt before the issuance of the SOR. (Answer at 1) \nApplicant earns $62,000 annually. (Tr. 38) His salary has increased by \napproximately $15,000 over the past two years. (Tr. 32) After a four-year-hiatus, \nApplicant\u2019s wife has returned to work. She earns $23,000 annually, and she helps pay the \nbills. (Tr. 51) Applicant contends that this additional income has enabled him to make more \nsteady debt payments. (Tr. 52) Applicant did not submit a budget into evidence. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18)  \nAlthough SOR pleadings do not need to be drafted with the specificity of criminal \ncomplaints, they must at minimum by specific enough to provide the applicant an ability to \nprepare a defense. (ISCR Case No. 02-17219 (App. Bd. Jan. 2005) Subparagraph 1.o \nalleges a debt, but does not identify the name of the creditor, and as such, does not cross \nthis minimum threshold. Consequently, in light of Applicant\u2019s denial, I resolve subparagraph \n1.o in his favor.  \nThe remaining debts trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d \nAG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations, and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nFederal state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nAlthough Applicant has been making debt payments, the majority of his \ndelinquencies remain outstanding. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused, in part, by the loss of family income that \noccurred when chronic illness compelled his wife, with whom he shared bill-paying \nresponsibilities, to quit working for several years. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nwere exacerbated when he was left to care for his grandson after his son was incarcerated. \nConversely, Applicant readily acknowledges that poor financial decisions also contributed \nto his financial problems. Particularly egregious was his decision to purchase a time-share \nproperty in 2017 when he had an outstanding, multi-year federal income tax delinquency. \nUnder these circumstances, circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control were not the \nprincipal cause of his financial problems. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control \n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, \ndivorce, or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is only partially applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has contacted some of his creditors and arranged plans to make \npayments towards the satisfaction of his debts. However, payments have not been \nconsistent, and the amount owed on his debts, particularly his income tax debts, remains \nlargely outstanding. In addition, Applicant has previously started payment plans and failed \nto complete them. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies to the \nefforts thus far to begin satisfying his consumer debts, and AG \u00b6 20(g), \u201cthe individual has \nmade arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is \nin compliance with those arrangements,\u201d applies with respect to his nascent efforts to pay \nhis tax debts, but AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial \ncounseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s dispute of his cable television bill, as set forth in subparagraph 1.n, was \nnot supported by any substantiating evidence. AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant has made some progress towards debt satisfaction. However, given the \nnature of some of these delinquencies, the length of time that they have been delinquent, \nand Applicant\u2019s lack of success in adhering to previous payment plans, I conclude that it is \ntoo soon to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. In reaching this \nconclusion, I was particularly troubled that he purchased a time-share property when he \nowed delinquent federal and state income tax debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. She is a high school graduate She enlisted in the Navy in 2012 and was honorably discharged in 2018. She anticipates being awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2022. She has been on the Dean\u2019s list for three semesters and anticipates graduating with honors. She was married from 2016 to 2018. She currently is in a cohabiting relationship. She has no children. Applicant has worked for her current federal contractor since October 2018.

The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 8. Applicant submitted a timely \nresponse and documents that are marked as Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE) A through D. There \nwere no objections to any evidence and it was all admitted. The case was assigned to me \non March 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. She is a high school graduate She enlisted in the Navy \nin 2012 and was honorably discharged in 2018. She anticipates being awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in August 2022. She has been on the Dean\u2019s list for three semesters \nand anticipates graduating with honors. She was married from 2016 to 2018. She \ncurrently is in a cohabiting relationship. She has no children. Applicant has worked for her \ncurrent federal contractor since October 2018. (Items 2, 3; AE A) \nApplicant attributes her past financial difficulties to being uneducated generally \nabout finances, credit, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratio. She explained that she \nwas never taught how finances work and was raised in a home where they lived paycheck \nto paycheck. She watched as her family decided which bills to pay or not pay to make \nends meet. Applicant accepted responsibility for the financial mistakes she made in her \ntwenties. In 2019, she learned her wages were being garnished and was confronted with \nthe reality of the dire financial position she was in. She was barely able to pay her living \nexpenses at the time. (Item 2; AE A) \nApplicant sought the assistance of a mentor who helped her while she transitioned \nfrom the military to civilian life. They reviewed her finances, and she learned her income \nwas far too low and her debt was too high. She realized she could not pay all of her debts. \nDuring this period, she learned her wife was taking money and claiming the car loans and \nconsumer debts were being paid, but she was not actually paying them. Applicant \nobtained personal loans in an attempt to pay the delinquent debts, but was unable to do \nso. Her mentor recommended she file Chapter 7 bankruptcy to get a fresh financial start. \nApplicant sought advice from a lawyer, who also advised her to file bankruptcy. (Item 2; \nAE A) \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2020 and all the debts alleged \nin the SOR, except one medical debt (1.h-$113), and others not alleged were discharged \nin December 2020. She stated in her answer that she would resolve this debt immediately. \nApplicant completed the financial counseling required to file bankruptcy, but also attended \nother financial management courses to learn more about debt resolution, interest rates, \nand budgeting. She embraced the lessons she learned from the financial classes and \nlearned about the Dave Ramsey financial management theories. She is following his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntheories. She has placed all of her bills on auto pay, so she does not miss a payment. \nShe is keenly aware of the negative implication of the bankruptcy, but is also aware of the \npositive impact it has had on her financial well-being. She has learned how to responsibly \nmanage her finances. Since she filed for bankruptcy she is no longer living paycheck to \npaycheck for the first time in her life, and all of her accounts are being paid on time. She \nhas a solid savings plan. She is practicing fiscal discipline. She stated that this change \nstarted with the bankruptcy, but has developed into a lifestyle of financial security that she \nhopes to pass on to others. (Item 2; AE A) \nApplicant provided a character letter from her immediate supervisor. He describes \nher as an exemplary employee who exceeded all of his expectations and went above and \nbeyond the requirements, especially during the pandemic, to ensure their customers were \ntaken care of. She has taken on critical roles in helping her team. She has kept him \napprised of her financial problems. He recognized her service to the Navy and considered \nher honest, hardworking, responsible, and eager to learn. (AE B) \nAnother supervisor provided a letter of support for Applicant. He noted that she is \none of his strongest and most trusted members of his staff and has been a huge benefit \nto the organization. She is an integral member of the team who has proven herself over \nand over to be worthy of her supervisor\u2019s trust and confidence. (AE C) \nA coworker of Applicant provided a letter of support stating that Applicant has \nlearned from her past financial errors. She is valued and can be trusted. She believes \nApplicant has gained confidence from dealing with her financial problems and is able to \naccomplish her goals. (AE D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that were discharged in Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in December 2020. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to being uneducated in how finances \nand credit works, her divorce, and her former spouse failing to pay their bills she said she \nwas paying, unbeknownst to Applicant. I find her spouse\u2019s nefarious actions and the \ndivorce were beyond Applicant\u2019s control. I find Applicant\u2019s lack of education in how to \nhandle her finances was somewhat beyond her control, although, she is ultimately \nresponsible for her choices and could have taken control over learning about how to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhandle her finances much earlier in her life. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Bankruptcy is a legal \nmeans to allow people a fresh financial start and under the circumstances her actions \nlikely made the most sense. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged in bankruptcy in December 2020. There is no \nevidence she has accumulated new debts. Resolving debts through bankruptcy does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to pay her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant completed the financial course required as part of her bankruptcy. She \nalso sought other financial management classes to learn how to manage her finances. It \nis clear she has embraced this opportunity to start over financially and is committed to \nbeing fiscally responsible. Although the bankruptcy resolved her delinquent debts, I found \nApplicant credible in her stated commitment to being fiscally responsible in the future. \nShe pays her bills on time, saves money, and is no longer living paycheck to paycheck. \nThe question remains whether enough time passed since her December 2020 bankruptcy \nto conclude that future financial issues are unlikely to recur. I believe Applicant has taken \nthe tools she learned in her financial management classes and has implemented them \ninto her lifestyle. There are no bright - line rules for determining when conduct is recent. \nThe determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. \nIf the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nproblematic conduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of \ntime demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. I believe Applicant does not want to fall back into being constantly \nunder stress due to her finances and that she is truly committed to ensuring she does not \nslide back into fiscal problems. I believe she has reformed. I find AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. I \nbelieve future financial problems are unlikely to recur and her behavior does not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy resolved her delinquent debts. It has only been a year since \nher bankruptcy, but I believe it has had a positive impact on her life. She is aware of the \ndire consequences that would occur if she were to again accumulate delinquent debts. \nUnlike many who fall back into their usual conduct after bankruptcy, she has actually \nchanged her conduct. She has educated herself on how to manage her finances and live \nwithin her means. She is accomplishing what bankruptcy is meant to do, give people a \nfresh financial start so they move on and be productive. Many never accomplish that goal, \nbut I believe Applicant is committed to accomplishing it. I believe her circumstances are \ncompelling, and she has met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

(HE 2) On June 3, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3) \nOn October 13, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On October 29, \n2021, his case was assigned to me. On November 2, 2021, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing, setting his hearing for November 17, 2021. (HE 1) His hearing was held as \nscheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the DOD Microsoft Teams video \nteleconference system. (Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 21\u00ad\n22; GE 1-6) Applicant did not offer any exhibits. (Tr. 14) Applicant said he did not receive \nthe government documents before the hearing. (Tr. 13) He agreed to go forward with his \nhearing and to receive the documents after the hearing. (Tr. 13-14) I advised him that he \nwould be permitted to object to the documents after he received them or reopen his \nhearing if he wished. (Tr. 13-14, 23) On November 29, 2021, DOHA received a transcript \nof the hearing. Applicant was given 10 days after receipt of the documents to express any \nobjections he may have for the Government\u2019s documents. (Tr. 23-24) The record was \nscheduled to close on December 17, 2021. (Tr. 60, 62) On December 24, 2021, I emailed \nApplicant and asked whether he had received GEs 1-6 and whether he wished to reopen \nthe hearing or present additional documents. (HE 4) \nOn December 24, 2021, I called Applicant and then I emailed the following \nparagraph to Applicant and Department Counsel based on our telephone conversation. I \nalso provided Applicant the opportunity to comment on my message quoted below. \nOn December 24, 2021, I telephoned Applicant and asked him if he \nreceived Department Counsel\u2019s exhibits, and he said that he had. I asked if \nhe had any objections to my consideration of them, and he said he did not. \nI asked if he wanted to [re]open the hearing, and he said he did not wish to \nreopen the hearing. I asked if he would send me an email about our \nconversation, and he said he did not wish to do so. He requested three \nmonths of delay in the issuance of my decision to enable him to improve his \nfinances, and I denied the request. (HE 4)      \n \nApplicant and Department Counsel did not provide any comments in response to this \nemail. \nSome details were excluded from this decision to protect Applicant\u2019s right to \nprivacy.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has 10 delinquent accounts totaling $85,859. A debt \nthat became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely affected his finances, \nincluding medical problems, underemployment, divorce, and unemployment. However, \n\u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant \nhas since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, \n2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A component is whether \nhe or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments \nto keep debts current. Applicant did not provide supporting documentary evidence that \nhe maintained contact with creditors. He indicated he contacted a financial advisor and \nintended for the financial advisor to contact his creditors and provide a plan for resolution \nof his delinquent accounts; however, there is insufficient information about his plan to \nmitigate financial concerns. He did not establish a track record of payments or good-faith \nmitigation of his delinquent SOR debts.   \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling. Applicant said he was \nresponsible for the 10 SOR debts, except he said his child support was current. He did \nnot provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the smaller debts in debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h for $478 and 1.i \nfor $335. He failed to provide updated documentation on the status of the 10 SOR debts, \nwhich was especially important for his child support debt because he said that debt was \ncurrent. He did not provide proof of \u201cin kind\u201d payments for items such as cars sufficient to \nshow they were equivalent to required child support payments. There is insufficient \nassurance that his financial problems are being resolved.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 62 years old, and he is seeking employment as a translator. In 1984, \nhe was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He served in Iraq as a translator from 2010 to 2011, \nand he held a security clearance at that time. He was unemployed for about one year \nafter returning from Iraq. In 2018, he divorced, and he has four children, who were born \nin 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2014. There is no evidence that Applicant violated his \nemployer\u2019s rules, committed criminal conduct, used illegal drugs, or abused alcohol. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond his control. These circumstances have made \nit very difficult for him to make sufficient income to address his delinquent accounts. He \ndid not provide sufficient details about his income over the last five years to fully mitigate \nthe financial considerations security concerns. Applicant served the United States in Iraq \nfor one year (2010-2011). His contributions toward national defense weigh heavily in his \nfavor. Aside from his finances, Applicant is an excellent candidate for a security \nclearance. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the 10 delinquent SOR debts. His lack of documented \nresponsible financial action raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debts, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. I have carefully applied the law, \nas set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant \nfailed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, including while holding a security \nclearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2008, but it is unclear from the \nrecord whether he was granted access to classified information when he used \nmarijuana. Eligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified information are not synonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. \nThe issuance of a security clearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for \naccess to classified national security information up to a certain level. Security \nclearance eligibility alone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. In \norder to gain access to specific classified materials, an individual must have not only \neligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure \nagreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 10, 2022). \nAdditionally, SOR \u00b6 1.b does not allege that Applicant used marijuana \u201cwhile \ngranted access to classified information\u201d; it alleges that he used marijuana \u201cafter being \ngranted access to classified information.\u201d As such, it does not allege the conduct \nidentified in AG \u00b6 25(g). The allegation does not allege any conduct that is not already \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a; it merely pleads an aggravating factor that does not raise any \nadditional disqualifying conditions. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR \nunder the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 \n1.b is concluded for Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s stated intention to use marijuana in the future was apparently \ncontingent upon marijuana becoming legal under federal law. AG \u00b6 25(g) is not \napplicable. SOR \u00b6 1.d is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the same marijuana use as SOR \u00b6 1.a, except it adds that it \nwas in violation of his employer\u2019s policy. That allegation does not allege any conduct \nthat is not already alleged; it merely pleads an aggravating factor that does not raise \nany additional disqualifying conditions. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nApplicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance. He continued to use \nit after he submitted his SF 86 in August 2018 in which he stated that he did not intend \nto use marijuana again in the near future, but perhaps he would use it again at some \npoint. He continued to use it after his background interview in October 2018. He used it \nuntil November 2019, which was only a month before he responded to interrogatories. \nApplicant is well aware that marijuana possession is still a federal crime, and \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. None of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse is cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because that conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse guideline. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe analysis under Guideline H applies equally here. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nApplicant received sexual gratification at massage parlors in the United States on \nnumerous occasions. He also engaged in prostitution in at least four other countries. His \nwife is unaware of said conduct, which creates a vulnerability to coercion. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant engaged in acts of \nprostitution over a period of about 14 years from 2003~2017; and on at least two \noccasions, after he was married. His wife still does not know of this conduct, which \nmakes him susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress. He has not attended any \ncounseling. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant engaged in acts of prostitution early in 2017. His wife does not know of \nthis conduct. As a result, he is vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant remains vulnerable to coercion. He produced no evidence of \ncounseling. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace and in his community. (AppXs B~F.) However, \nApplicant remains vulnerable to coercion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the sexual behavior, and \npersonal conduct security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In his \nexplanation about his debts and tax issues, he described his financial and personal \nproblems from 2005 to 2021.

After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 65 years old. He has been employed as a senior design engineer by \na defense contractor since 2019. This is his first application for a security clearance. He \ngraduated high school in 1975, earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1985, and a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1992. He has been married since 2005, and has two adult step-children. (Item \n3) \nApplicant has had several periods of unemployment. He was laid off from his job \nin 2018, and was out of work for approximately five months. After another layoff in 2012, \nhe was again unemployed for about two and a half years. During this time, he looked for \nwork in his field, and oversaw the restoration of his mother\u2019s home. He was supported \nby unemployment compensation and his spouse\u2019s social security. Over the last 16 \nyears, Applicant has moved several times for employment within his home state, and he \nmade one move to another state for about ten months in 2015. (Items 2, 3, 7) \nApplicant provided several explanations about why he did not file or pay his \nfederal or state taxes. He stated that an out-of-state move, a tight and expensive \nhousing market, his mother\u2019s health, and personal expenses in 2016 were reasons he \ncould not hire an accountant to complete his 2015 taxes. He reported that his mother-in-\nlaw\u2019s declining health, a demanding job, and household moves were reasons he could \nnot hire an accountant to complete his 2016 taxes. He stated that household moves, a \ndemanding job, his mother-in-law\u2019s declining health, a health issue in November 2017, \nhis wife\u2019s medical issues and appointments, and the complexity of itemized deductions \nwere reasons that he could not complete his 2017 taxes. He reported that taking care of \nhis mother-in-law, his health issues, his wife\u2019s health issues, his failure to file or pay \ntaxes for 2015 \u2013 2017, and the complexity of itemized deductions were reasons that he \ncould not complete his 2018 taxes. He asserted that federal and state taxes were \nwithheld from his pay check from 2015 \u2013 2018.

He said \nthat unless his employer provided him with an extended paid leave to focus solely on \ngetting his taxes completed, he will only be able to work on them when he has free time, \nand is not busy with his other personal responsibilities. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax records show that as of March 2020, his 2015, 2016, and \n2018 federal income tax returns had not been filed. His 2017 return was filed in \nNovember of 2019, which was more than a year late. The records show that he made \npayments to the IRS from 2016 to 2019 in varying amounts. No documentation was \nprovided to show that these were voluntary payments, not garnishments. Applicant \nreported that he had previously owed taxes to the IRS, and around 2012 had a plan in \nplace to pay $100 monthly. He was uncertain about the status of this payment plan or \nthe amount that had been paid. (Item 4, 7) \nThe record includes a proposed installment agreement with the IRS dated \nDecember 8, 2021. Applicant contacted the IRS on November 29, 2021, and the IRS \nproposed a repayment plan of $250 monthly payments beginning in January 2022. The \nIRS had not yet calculated the full amount that he owed. No documentation was \nprovided to show that he has made any payments on this agreement or the amounts \nowed. (AE B) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent state tax records show that he had delinquent state tax \ndebt for 2015, 2016, and 2018. Between April 2019 to August 2020, he paid $200 \nmonthly toward this debt. No documentation was provided to show if these were \nvoluntary payments or garnishments. The records also show that he had a $227 tax \ndebt for 2020, which was paid in November 2021. (Item 4; AE C \u2013 J) \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2013. He had $493,281 of debt \ndischarged without payment in June 2013. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) In his Answer, he states that he \nhad to file bankruptcy because of financial and personal problems starting in 2005, \nincluding: purchasing a home in a speculative housing market; moves for employment; \nproblems with renting his home; a failed start-up business; loss of employment; an \nexpensive home rental market; the cost of health insurance; and medical problems of \nhim and his wife. (Item 2, 5) \nIn addition to the bankruptcy, the SOR alleged that Applicant had unfiled Federal \nand state income tax returns for tax years 2015-2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.i). He also had an \noutstanding $3,334 federal tax debt for 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) as well as a state tax debt of \n$3,094 for 2015, which was repaid through garnishment in 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and a \n2016 state tax debt of $2,642 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He provided no documentation \nabout his 2009 unpaid tax debt. He failed to provide documentation showing that his \noutstanding state and Federal tax returns have been filed, even belatedly. His state tax \nrecords show that he still owes $301 for 2016, a debt which remains unpaid.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nTimely filing of income tax returns and paying taxes owed is a basic duty for U.S. \ncitizens, and is required by law. The Appeal Board has held that \u201ca security clearance \nrepresents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national \nsecrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct \nbearing on an Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation as reflected in the Guideline F concerns that were alleged.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015)). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the tax and \nbankruptcy records in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) ,19(c), 19(f) apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should \napply. While his bankruptcy was nine years ago, he did not provide documentation \nshowing that he resolved the delinquent tax debt from 2009 during that time. He did not \nprovide sufficient documentation showing that all of his taxes are now filed and paid, or \nthat they are being paid. He provided no documentation of his current financial situation, \nevidence which might establish his ability to address his debts responsibly. His failures \nto timely file state and Federal income tax returns and pay his tax debts are recent, not \nisolated, and are ongoing and unresolved. This continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s two instances of loss of employment, his household moves for his \nemployment, he and his wife\u2019s medical ailments, and wildfires in his home state, had an \nimpact on his finances. However, these issues are not an excuse for failing to timely file \nor pay taxes for four consecutive years, and this failure was not due to reasons beyond \nhis control. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that he undertook \nresponsible action to address them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in \n2013, so he is given consideration under 20(c). However, since his tax filings and tax \ndebts are not resolved or under control, 20(c) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing that he has \nundertaken good-faith efforts to address his failure to file or pay his taxes. He failed to \ntimely file his state and Federal income tax returns for four years and the record does \nnot show any filings for three of these years. There is insufficient evidence to show that \nhe has resolved all of his tax debt, and has cured his multiple late filed returns. While \nApplicant may have recently contacted the IRS to set up a payment arrangement, there \nis insufficient documentation in the record to show that he has made payments on the \nmost recent debts, or has a track record of making consistent payments. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) \nand 20(g) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file Federal and state income tax returns, and pay Federal and state tax debt \nunder Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 18, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is married with five children. He has a Master\u2019s \ndegree in Electrical Engineering. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Design \nand Analysis Engineer IV. He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline D \u2013 Sexual Behavior  \nGuideline M \u2013 Use of Information Technology \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant for many years, between 2003 and 2014, \nengaged in sexual misconduct in the workplace, the misuse of information technology, \nand poor personal conduct. Applicant admits in part and denies in part the allegations \nset forth in the SOR. (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.) \nApplicant\u2019s first job out of college was working for a defense contractor from 2003 \nto 2011. He was granted a security clearance in 2003 or 2004. During this period of \nemployment, he engaged in many acts of misconduct. \nIn 2009, he underwent a \npolygraph examination and admitted that he viewed pornography on his corporate \ncomputer about a dozen times, and he masturbated in his office on three to five \noccasions. (Tr. p. 49.) In September 2009, he was required to sign a Government \npolicy statement confirming this misconduct. \nFrom 2011 to 2013, he left his \nemployment in the defense industry and worked outside of the industry. (Government \nExhibit 3.) \nIn 2013, Applicant re-entered the defense industry, and started working for his \ncurrent employer. He was granted a special access clearance in late 2014. In 2014, he \nagain underwent a polygraph examination. \nDuring this polygraph examination, \nApplicant admitted that he had relapsed in viewing pornography at work, which occurred \nabout ten times. (Tr. p. 51.) This time, however, he was viewing pornography on his \ncell phone while at work. \nThis misconduct occurred about every three months or so. \nHe also admitted to misusing his corporate computer in many ways. He loading a non-\nwork related compact disc into it between 2003 and 2007; he had used a personal USB \ndrive to transfer proprietary text files and powerpoint presentations from 2008 to 2011; \nhe had used a personal USB drive to transfer proprietary information between \nNovember 2013 to March 2014; and, he had used his corporate computer to charge his \ncell phone one to two times per week from October 2013 to May 2014. Applicant stated \nthat he deliberately withheld information about his use of personal USB drives in his \ncorporate computer during his earlier investigation in 2008. (Government Exhibit 3.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.a.  Applicant, on multiple occasions between 2005 until at least 2014, used the \ncorporate computer to view pornography at work.  This conduct was in violation of \ncompany and DoD policies and regulations, as well as United States Intelligence \nCommunity policy.  Applicant testified that in 2005, he was working full time for a \ndefense contractor, and working on his Master\u2019s degree.  He was twenty-five years old, \nnewly married, with a young family.  He was balancing lots of demands, and was \nstressed.  He found that the only privacy he had was at the office, and he started to \nview pornography at work on the corporate computer.  This misconduct continued until \nat least 2014.  He explained that he would usually work more than the standard 40-hour \nwork week, and after hours or on a break he would view pornography.  He stated that \nhe never did it where anyone could see him.  He stated that he has not engaged in this \nmisconduct since 2014.  He knew this misconduct to be prohibited, but chose to engage \nin it anyway.    \n \n1.b.  Applicant, on multiple occasions from 2005 until at least 2008, masturbated in his \noffice while at work.  He believes this occurred between two to four or five separate \noccasions.  He testified that he realized that this behavior was not in line with his \nreligious beliefs and wanting to be honest with his wife and his church leaders, and so \nhe started seeing a counselor for this behavior.  He stated that he has not engaged in \nthis misconduct since 2008.  Applicant knew this misconduct to be prohibited, but chose \nto engage in it anyway. \n2.a.  See Applicant\u2019s misconduct discussion above under 1.a.   \n2.b.  Applicant, on multiple occasions from 2008 to at least 2014, transferred personal \nfiles without authorization between his corporate computer and his personal home \ncomputer using his personal thumb drives.  He stated that he has not engaged in this \nmisconduct since 2014.   He knew this misconduct to be prohibited, but chose to \nengage in it anyway. \n2.c.  Applicant, on multiple occasions from about 2003 to 2007, loaded unauthorized \nsoftware onto his corporate computer.  He testified that he would load a music CD on \nhis corporate computer.  He also used the charger on his corporate computer to charge \nhis personal cell phone.  He stated that he has not engaged in this misconduct since \n2007.  He knew this misconduct to be prohibited, but chose to engage in it anyway.   \n3.a.  In February 2015, the Government revoked Applicant\u2019s existing access to  \nclassified Information and disapproved any additional access for violation of Intelligence \nCommunity Policy guidance 704.2.  In September 2009, Applicant signed a US \nGovernment policy statement wherein it noted that his viewing of pornography on his \ncorporate computer, and his masturbating in the office, which occurred between 2005 to \n2008 were noted misconduct under personal conduct and misuse of information \ntechnology systems.  He understood at that time that his misconduct was against \ncompany and Government policies.  In 2014, during polygraph testing of the Applicant, \nhe stated that he did not take the signed policy statement seriously.  He believed his \nmisconduct was okay because he was not using his corporate computer.

See Applicant\u2019s misconduct discussed above in paragraph 1. \n \n3.c.  See Applicant\u2019s misconduct discussed above in paragraph 2. \nTwo polygraph examinations of the Applicant, the first conducted by a previous \nemployer in 2008, and the second conducted in 2014, by his current employer, revealed \nthat for many years, while employed in the defense industry, Applicant has engaged in \nsexual misconduct in the workplace. He has also misused information technology, and \nengaged in poor personal conduct. These actions were in violation of DoD policies and \nprocedures. \nApplicant testified that he has received regular security briefings from his \nemployers since beginning his employment in the defense industry. (Tr. p. 76.) He \nstated that when he started working for the defense industry he was young and ignorant \nand just learning the rules and regulations. \nHe believes that he now has a firm \nunderstanding of the company policy and procedures. He believes he has grown and \nmatured since he committed these violations, as it has been nearly ten years. This is \nnot entirely accurate. Applicant engaged in misconduct as a young man in his twenties, \nand this misconduct continued, with pattern of relapse, well into his late thirties. He \nunderwent his first polygraph examination in 2008, and was made aware of misconduct, \nwhen he signed a U.S. Government policy statement in September 2009. His relapses \nwere noted in 2014, and his Special Access was revoked in February 2015. \nApplicant testified that although he would like to work in the defense industry for \na contractor, he does not need a security clearance in order to be employable. He has \nchosen to confront these issues in his past and would like to work for the Government, \nbut there are many companies outside of the Department of Defense that could use his \nskills without the need for a security clearance. In fact, that is what he was doing \nbetween 2011 and 2013, working in other fields outside of the Government. \nExcerpts from Applicant\u2019s employment records reflect that he has been a major \ncontributor to the company.  Documents reflecting his job performance show that he has \neither \u201cmet expectations\u201d, \u201cexceeded\u201d, or \u201cfar exceeded\u201d his job requirements.  He has \nalso been eligible for the retention bonus program.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) Applicant \ntestified that since 2013, his performance evaluations have been excellent.  He has \nreceived ratings of either \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d or \u201cgreatly exceeds expectations.\u201d  (Tr. \np. 20.)  He stated that he gets along well with his co-workers and management.  \nLetters of recommendation from various individuals who know the Applicant well, \nwho include friends, church members, his wife, and his counselor, attest to his \ncharacter, patriotism and ability to protect classified information. \nThey collectively \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nindicate that Applicant is trustworthy, responsible and has good judgment.  They all \nrecommend that he be granted a security clearance.   (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \nA letter from his counselor confirmed that Applicant attended sessions twice a \nmonth at first and then later on a monthly basis. The sessions involved therapy in \ndealing with stress management techniques and how to avoid his addiction. In addition \nhow to be accountable to his wife, church community and others. He believes that \nApplicant is committed to ensuring that his sexual misconduct does not continue. \nApplicant is a very involved father who coaches his children\u2019s basketball, \nbaseball, and soccer teams. He attends talent shows and other events to support his \nchildren. (Tr. pp. 22.) Applicant is and has always been an active member of his \nchurch, and his faith is important to him. \nHe has served in various positions of \nleadership, including a Seminary Teacher and Bishop of his Ward.  (Tr. pp. 22-24.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual Behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.  These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission.  No adverse inference concerning the \nstandard in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 14 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One is potentially applicable. \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant viewed pornography on his corporate computer on a number of \noccasions while at work, and masturbated in the office while at work.  He signed a form \nin 2009 informing him of the Government\u2019s concern regarding this misconduct.  In 2014, \nhe relapsed and his Special Access was revoked.  His behavior over the years has \nbeen egregious and inexcusable under any circumstances.  Although there is no \nevidence that he has engaged in this misconduct recently, the behavior continues to \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment.  Applicant never contacted \nhis security officer to report his misconduct.  If it were not for the polygraph \nexaminations in 2008 and again in 2014, this information may not have been disclosed. \nAccordingly, this guideline is found against the Applicant.    \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nis set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information.  Information technology includes any computer-based \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information.  This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n (a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, \nor other protected information on to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system; \n7 \n (e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nAG \u00b6 41 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \nIn addition to engaging in sexual misconduct at work, Applicant loaded \nunauthorized software onto his corporate computer. Although there is no evidence that \nhe has done this recently, the behavior continues to casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and judgment. Applicant never contacted his security officer to report \nhis misconduct. If it were not for the polygraph examinations in 2008 and 2014, this \ninformation may not have been disclosed. Accordingly, this guideline is found against \nthe Applicant. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior;  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government a or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.  Such \nconduct includes:  \n \n \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s history of sexual misconduct, misuse of information technology, and \npoor personal conduct beginning in 2003 and continuing until at least 2014, \ndemonstrates poor judgment, immaturity, and a total disregard for DoD and company \npolicy, regulations, and procedure. This misconduct shows a pattern and gives rise to \nserious concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause of the nature of the offenses, and the circumstances surrounding the offenses. \nApplicant engaged in this conduct at work, while being entrusted with a security \nclearance. \nIt is recognized that Applicant has not engaged in this misconduct for almost ten \nyears, however, given his long history of misconduct, his relapses in sexual misconduct \ndue to his addiction, and the fact that if it were not for the polygraph examinations this \ninformation may not have been disclosed, there remains uncertainty and concern about \nhis credibility. \nThe underlying behavior itself is outrageous and egregious, and \ncontinues to cast doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant never contacted his security officer to report \nhis misconduct. It was only because of the polygraph examination in 2014, that this \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \ninformation was disclosed. A decision to determine eligibility for access to classified \ninformation will be always be resolved in favor of national security. Under the particular \ncircumstances here, the before-mentioned disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished and have not been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D, M, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and \nanalysis set forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Sexual Behavior, Use of Information \nTechnology, and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. \nAgainst Applicant. \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a., 3.b., and 3.c.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, each with a brief explanation. Her admissions and explanations are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 48 years old. She is a single parent with two sons. One son is in his thirties and serves in the U.S. Army. She also has a 10-year-old son who lives with her at home. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. She has worked in the defense industry, with a clearance, since 2002, and for her current employer since 2010. (Tr. 31- 33, 55; GE 1) Applicant lives in State 1. Mr. C is the brother of Applicant\u2019s character witness, W. Mr. C has lived in a large city in State 2 (but has now relocated to State 1, according to W (Tr. 88.) Applicant and Mr. C dated long-distance for about a year, in about 2008. They remained friends afterwards. Applicant and W would visit Mr. C in State 2 fairly frequently in later years. (GE 6) Mr. C owns an auto parts and repair shop, among other ventures, in State 2.

The \nadministrative judge issued a pre-hearing case management order and exchanged e-\nmails with the parties on procedural matters.  \nOn April 20, 2022, DOHA issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s hearing for May \n17, 2022, to occur in person at a geographic location near where she lived and worked. \nOn May 10, 2022, the case was assigned to me, after the initial administrative judge \nbecame unavailable. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-D, all of \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant and one witness also testified. I held the \nrecord open, initially until May 31, 2022, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional information. She timely submitted documents which I marked as Applicant\u2019s \nPost-Hearing (PH) Exhibits 1-6, all of which were admitted without objection. \nOn July 25, 2022, Applicant reported that she had been contacted by police about \nrecovery of the vehicle which is largely the subject of this case. I therefore reopened the \nrecord and admitted the related e-mails (marked as PH Exhibit 7) without objection. \nCorrespondence between myself and the parties is also included in PH 7. Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing exhibits are discussed and identified in the Facts section, below. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 24, 2022.The record closed on July 27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, each with a brief explanation. Her \nadmissions and explanations are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. She is a single parent with two sons. One son is in his \nthirties and serves in the U.S. Army. She also has a 10-year-old son who lives with her at \nhome. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. She has worked in the defense \nindustry, with a clearance, since 2002, and for her current employer since 2010. (Tr. 31-\n33, 55; GE 1) \nApplicant lives in State 1. Mr. C is the brother of Applicant\u2019s character witness, W. \nMr. C has lived in a large city in State 2 (but has now relocated to State 1, according to \nW (Tr. 88.) Applicant and Mr. C dated long-distance for about a year, in about 2008. They \nremained friends afterwards. Applicant and W would visit Mr. C in State 2 fairly frequently \nin later years. (GE 6) \nMr. C owns an auto parts and repair shop, among other ventures, in State 2. \nApplicant testified that he had a \u201clavish lifestyle,\u201d (Tr. 36, 57) and expensive taste, \nparticularly for cars.

He said his credit cards were \u201cmaxed out\u201d \nand could not afford to do so himself. (Tr. 59; GE 6) In exchange, she said he told her he \nwould help pay off her student loans of about $5,000-6,000. (Tr. 36, 62) \nIn about September 2016, Applicant flew to State 3 at Mr. C\u2019s expense. She met \nthe sales person in State 3, and signed the papers for the car. Mr. C remained in State 2, \nand the dealer transported the car there after the transaction. (Tr. 36-38) \nApplicant paid for the car by taking out a loan from Bank A of about $136,000. It \nwas her understanding that Mr. C would be making payments on the car. (GE 6) She said \nhe made only about two monthly payments (of about $1,200 each). (PH 1) Applicant was \nsoon notified by Bank A that payments had fallen behind. Initially, Mr. C was involved in \ndiscussions with the bank, and said he would make payments, but did not follow up. (Tr. \n36-37, 61) Mr. C did not assist Applicant with her student loans, as he had promised. (Tr. \n36, 62) \nIn about 2017, the car debt was charged off. (Tr. 38-39; GE 3 at 12) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nApplicant said Bank A made a settlement offer of about $105,000 ($8,700 a month for 12 \nmonths), but she could not afford it. (Tr. 41-42: GE 2; AE B) \nApplicant retained counsel and filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2020. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) (AE C; GE 4, GE 5) She declared the car debt at SOR \u00b6 1.a, along with \nseveral other debts. Her declared nonpriority debt total was about $171,437 (of which \n$140,740 concerned the car loan). (GE 5 at 14, 18; AE B) She reaffirmed two debts, both \nmortgages on her home, totaling about $290.000. (Tr. 48-49, GE 5 at 11-12, 33) The \ndebts were discharged in December 2020. (AE A) The docket sheet from the bankruptcy \ncase reflects that Applicant participated in credit counseling during the bankruptcy \nprocess, as required. (GE 5 at 2) \nApplicant disclosed the car debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) on her SCA and explained the \ncircumstances in her background interview, as well as in her hearing testimony. (GE 1, \nGE 6) She is remorseful about her conduct, and recognizes in hindsight that she made a \npoor decision to enter into this arrangement with Mr. C, which put her family, finances, \nclearance, and career in great jeopardy. She had never done this before, has not done it \nsince, and will not do it again. She does not live beyond her means. (Tr. 27-29, 66-67, \n70; GE 2 at 6; PH 5) \nApplicant testified that the last time she saw Mr. C was several months ago at a \nfamily funeral. They did not have contact. (Tr. 52-53) \nApplicant contacted police about the car and attempted to file charges against Mr. \nC for theft by deception. She was told she could file only a \u201cmiscellaneous report of a civil \ndispute\u201d against him, since she had been told that State 1 police authorities had no \njurisdiction over the matter (since both the car and Mr. C were out of state. (Tr. 86, 94, \n95; GE 1 at 29-30) She filed a police report in 2018 so that the police could retrieve the \ncar.

She said the officer requested contact information for the \nbank and the towing company. An e-mail from the officer that Applicant provided said he \nwas unable to release any documentation to her, because the police matter remained \npending. (PH 7) \nApplicant\u2019s character witness, W, testified. W has a college degree She is a \nlongtime friend of Applicant, of about 20 years. She lives in the same area as Applicant. \nShe attested that Applicant is a \u201cworkaholic,\u201d who is loyal, dependable, and honest. \nApplicant does not deserve to have her career ruined over what W feels was a single \ninstance of poor judgment. Applicant has had a difficult time in recent years, as both \nparents recently passed away. (Tr. 81-93; GE 6) \nW is also Mr. C\u2019s brother. W attested that Mr. C has a long history of deceptive, \ncriminal behavior. He took advantage of Applicant, as he has with many others, and she \nwas a victim in the situation. He is very manipulative. She also said her brother is bipolar. \nDue to his mental health issues, W petitioned to have Mr. C involuntarily committed on \nmultiple occasions in recent years, including at least in May 2018 and March 2019. (PH \n2, PH 3) W confirmed that Applicant has broken off contact with Mr. C, and if he texts \nApplicant, she tells W to request that he stop doing so. (Tr. 81-93) She said, \u201cI know for \na fact this is something she\u2019ll never do again.\u201d (Tr. 91) \nApplicant has an annual salary of $145,000. (Tr. 71, AE E) She has savings and a \nremainder at the end of each month, and several hundred thousand dollars in her \ncompany retirement plan. (Tr. 75-77) Her credit reports show no delinquencies. (GE 3, \nGE 4) \nApplicant provided recommendation letters from several references. They attested \nto Applicant\u2019s strong work ethic, dedication and commitment to the team and the \ncompany\u2019s goals. She is proactive, self-motivated, and deadline-oriented; she is a \npleasure to work with. (PH 4) Applicant\u2019s recent and current work evaluations provided \nsimilar detail. (PH 6) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant bought a very expensive luxury car for a friend. She took out a \nloan of well over $100,000 to do so. He could not afford the vehicle, and neither could \nshe. She travelled to a neighboring state at his request and signed for the car, which was \nthen delivered to him, also out of state. Not surprisingly, the friend made only a few \npayments on the car. Applicant attempted to settle the matter with the bank but could not \nafford to do so. She resolved the matter by filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy (thereby resolving \nsome of her other debts as well, though she reaffirmed her mortgage debts). AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \nApplicant made a very poor decision to assist Mr. C in buying him an expensive \nluxury car that he could not afford, and that she had no business buying herself. She has \nworked hard to make a good life for herself and her sons. By entering into the \narrangement, she jeopardized her finances and her career. She credibly established that \nthis was an isolated incident and she will not place herself in this position again. She \nrecognizes that she made a very poor decision. She resolved the luxury auto loan debt \nthrough bankruptcy, and her bankruptcy has now been discharged. Applicant\u2019s credit \nhistory and current financial stability are otherwise excellent, as is her employment record. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) fully apply to mitigate the financial security concerns in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I give significant weight to Applicant\u2019s credibility \nand that of her witness. I considered her lengthy career with her employer and in the \ndefense industry as a well-regarded employee to be highly positive evidence in her favor. \nI regard this as a serious but isolated incident that will not recur. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nfinancial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He has worked \nfor his current employer since about April 2019. From April 2019 until November 2019, \nhe was a contract employee. In November 2019, he became a permanent employee of \nthe government contractor. He has bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. He has been \nmarried since 1982. He has three adult children. Two of his children have a \ndevelopmental disorder, and are fully dependent on Applicant\u2019s financial assistance. \nApplicant has never held a security clearance, but has worked on sensitive matters as a \ngovernment contractor. Applicant has a technical and scientific background, holds \nnumerous U.S. and international patents, and has authored dozens of scientific and \ntechnical publications. (Transcript (Tr.) 35-37; 46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1.) \nApplicant earns approximately $130,000 annually from his current employer. He \nearned about $121,000 in 2020 and about $126,000 in 2021. He receives $740 per \nmonth from a pension from a former employer. He also receives about $2,600 per \nmonth from Social Security. Applicant\u2019s wife does not work, but receives about $990 per \nmonth from social security. Applicant currently has a surplus in funds at the end of each \nmonth. At the time of the hearing he had between $7,000 and $8,000 total in cash and \nin a savings account. Applicant has about $450,000 in assets, including about $420,000 \nin equity in his home. From about 2009 until about 2018, Applicant worked as a \nconsultant for several companies, but primarily for Company A. From about 2009 until \nabout 2015, Applicant\u2019s earnings from Company A were lucrative. For the first several \nmonths, Applicant made between $5,000 to $10,000 per month, but that amount \nincreased to about $20,000 per month for several years. In about 2015, Applicant \nmoved at his own expense in order to be closer to Company A\u2019s place of operation. \nBeginning shortly after his move in 2015, Company A made a strategic change in how \nthey ran their business. This change caused Company A\u2019s revenues to drop \ndramatically, and consequently, Applicant began making far less money. From 2016 \nuntil 2018, Applicant made between $10,000 and $15,000 per year. He looked for other \nwork but could not find employment in his field until he started with his current employer. \nAs a consultant, he was ineligible for unemployment benefits during this time. (Tr. 27-\n29; 31-32; 44; 47-49; 50-52, 83-95; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A-C) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had ten delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$72,000. These debts consisted of telecommunications debts, credit card debts, and \ndelinquent Federal taxes. Approximately $36,000 of the delinquent debt in the SOR is \nfrom unpaid taxes from the 2016 and 2017 tax years. Applicant attributed the financial \ndelinquencies to not having enough money to pay his bills as a result of the \naforementioned lack of income and unexpected medical bills that his wife incurred after \nsuffering a fall in 2015. He also acknowledged that part of the reason he fell behind on \nhis Federal taxes was that he failed to account for the amount of Federal taxes he \nwould have to pay from his earnings. Applicant admitted all the SOR debts with \nadditional comment in his response to the SOR. For several of the SOR debts, his \ncomments in his response to the SOR and his testimony make it clear that he does not \nbelieve he owes them.

(Tr. 3, 40-45, 52-83, 97-99; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1-5, 6; AE A-D) \nThe $251 and $682 telecommunications debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g, \nrespectively, have not been resolved. These debts were originally incurred with the \nsame telecommunications carrier. While Applicant admitted these debts, he does not \nbelieve that he owes them. When Applicant began suffering a decline in income, he \ncancelled his accounts with this creditor to save money. He claimed that when he \nclosed these accounts, the creditor told him he owed them no money, but then later \nsent him a bill. He has the funds to pay the accounts but does not want to do so on \nprinciple because he thinks he has paid everything he owed on these accounts. He also \nbelieves he does not owe these accounts because the creditor offered him the \nopportunity to open another account with it. Applicant claimed that he had a written \ninvitation from the creditor to open a new account, but he did not provide it. He \npresented no documentary evidence that he has made a payment, disputed this debt, \noffered or negotiated a payment agreement, or taken any significant actions to resolve \nthis debt. These debts do not appear on Applicant\u2019s 2022 credit report. (Tr. 44-45, 73, \n81-82, 98-99; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 5; AE B, C) \nThe credit card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h have not been \nresolved. In his response to the SOR, Applicant claimed that he has not yet addressed \nthese debts because he has been addressing other debts. At his hearing, he testified \nthat he does not believe that he owes these debts because they are time barred by the \nstatute of limitations in the state where he resides. Applicant also did not attempt to \nresolve these debts because he disagreed with the interest and penalties that he \nbelieved were part of the balance, and because he prioritized other debts. He does not \nintend to pay these debts. Instead, he plans to let them age off his credit report. (Tr. 40-\n44, 73-83, 98; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-5; AE A-C) \nThe $8,564 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c has been resolved. Applicant \ntestified and presented documentation to corroborate that he satisfied this debt with the \ncreditor for less than the full balance in September 2021. Applicant\u2019s 2022 credit report \nalso confirms that this debt was settled. (Tr. 78, 97-98; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 3, 4, 5; AE A, C, E) \nThe delinquent Federal taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j have been partially \nresolved. Applicant testified and presented documentation to corroborate that he has \nmade and complied with a payment arrangement with the IRS to satisfy those debts. \nApplicant was first delinquent on his Federal taxes for the 2015 tax year. He fell behind \non his taxes because he did not withhold enough money or make sufficient offset \npayments throughout the 2015, 2016, and 2017 tax years. When it came time to make \nhis Federal tax payments for those years, he did not have sufficient funds to pay them \nbecause of his lack of income with Company A. Applicant first made a payment \narrangement with the IRS in 2016 for Federal taxes owed from the 2015 tax year that \nwere not alleged in the SOR. From 2016 until November 2019, Applicant made sporadic \nbut inconsistent payments on his delinquent 2015, 2016, and 2017 Federal taxes. \nEventually, in March 2020, he made a payment arrangement with the IRS that he has \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nconsistently paid for over two years, through June 2022.

He does not owe \ndelinquent Federal taxes after the 2017 tax year. (Tr. 13-14, 38, 42, 52-71, 95-97; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, D) \nA friend and former business colleague of Applicant whom he has known for over \n25 years testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant\u2019s witness holds a PhD in physics and \nhas held a government security clearance. The witness attested to Applicant\u2019s honesty, \ndiligence, and kindness. The witness believes that Applicant should be permitted to hold \na security clearance. The witness also corroborated Applicant\u2019s employment experience \nwith Company A. (Tr. 24-34) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s established SOR debts, including his failure to pay Federal taxes for \nseveral years, evidence his history of financial delinquencies. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide \nevidence in mitigation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to underemployment from 2015 until \n2019 and unforeseen medical bills that resulted from a fall that his wife took. These \ncauses were beyond his control. However, Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his Federal taxes \nwas within his control as he first fell behind on these tax payments because he did not \nwithhold a sufficient portion of his income. \nThere is documentary corroboration that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c has been \nsettled and paid for an amount less than owed. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant, as \nAG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \nApplicant made a payment arrangement with the IRS before the SOR was issued \nthat he has complied with for over two years. He has also paid his Federal taxes timely \nafter 2017, showing reform and rehabilitation. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j are concluded for \nApplicant, as AG \u00b6 20(b), AG \u00b6 20(d), and AG \u00b6 20(g) apply. \nNone of the other SOR debts are mitigated. Applicant claimed that he does not \nthink he owes the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g because he thinks he paid the debts in \nfull.

Even if these debts are time barred, the Appeal Board has \u201cheld that reliance \non a state's statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties and is of limited mitigative value.\u201d ISCR No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 26, 2016) (citing ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008)). \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s reliance on the statute of limitations after years of not \naddressing these debts is not acting responsibly under the circumstances. Finally, while \nApplicant claimed that he took issue with the amount of these debts because he \nbelieved they included interest and penalties, this is not a reasonable basis to dispute \nthese debts. Paying interest and penalties is a standard consequence of borrowing \nmoney, especially when one fails to timely pay the borrowed money back. Even if being \ncharged interest and penalties is a reasonable basis to dispute these debts, Applicant \nprovided no documented proof, such as an applicable credit card agreement that did not \npermit interest and penalties, in order to substantiate the basis of his dispute. Finally, he \nprovided no evidence of his actions to resolve his dispute with these creditors. None of \nthe mitigating factors apply to these debts. \nBased upon his attempts to rely upon the statute of limitations and his likely \nfrivolous disputes with paying interest and penalties, I find that Applicant did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances and that he did not make a good-faith effort to \nrepay his SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s willingness to fail to fulfill his financial obligations \nbecause of the charging of interest and penalties leaves me unable to find that his \nfinancial issues are unlikely to recur. As evidenced by his unresolved debts, his financial \nissues are ongoing. These debts and his treatment of them continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \nApplicant incurred a $37,425 debt that he was unable to pay. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant settled and paid the only debt at issue. His finances are stable again. \nHe recently received a $25,000 pay raise, and his wife returned to the workforce. He is \nable to pay all his current bills without accruing any additional delinquent debts. \nApplicant had a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. His finances do not cast doubt on his current judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Security concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the first two SOR allegations with explanations and denied the remaining three allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at his present job in February 2020. He is an armed security officer. He also works at a second job providing network telephone support. He is a few hours shy of obtaining his bachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2007 and served on active duty until 2016 when he separated with an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance when he was in the Army. He was located in Korea when he separated from the Army in 2016. In April 2016, he took a federal contractor position while he was still located in country.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) His \nadmissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at \nhis present job in February 2020. He is an armed security officer. He also works at a \nsecond job providing network telephone support. He is a few hours shy of obtaining his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2007 and served on active duty until \n2016 when he separated with an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance \nwhen he was in the Army. He was located in Korea when he separated from the Army in \n2016. In April 2016, he took a federal contractor position while he was still located in \ncountry. He remained in Korea until August 2017 when the events that are described \nbelow transpired. He is single and has no children. (Tr. 21-24; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) received nonjudicial punishment under \nArticle 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in August 2015, for the \noffenses of drunken misconduct and indecent exposure; (2) received a two-year \ndebarment in August 2017, from all U.S. military facilities in South Korea for possession \nof opiates with intent to distribute; (3) falsified material facts on his May 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA) when he answered that his reason for leaving employment \nof a former employer was because the \u201ccontract ended,\u201d when he deliberately failed to \nstate that he was barred from the military installation; (4) falsified material facts during \nhis June 2020 personal subject interview with an authorized investigator when he \nstated, in reference to his Article 15, he was not one of the persons who removed their \nclothes and deliberately tried to conceal that his Article 15 offenses also included \nindecent exposure; and (5) falsified material facts during his September 2020 personal \nsubject interview with an authorized investigator when he initially stated that he was \nunaware of the investigation that led to his debarment, but later in the interview admitted \nhe was questioned by the military police in July 2017 regarding possession of opiates. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e). \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant admitted that he accepted Article 15 punishment in 2015 \nwhen he was in the Army. He described this discipline in his May 2020 SCA as drunken \nmisconduct. He named the command that initiated the action and the location where it \ntook place. The events that led to the Article 15 began when Applicant was out drinking \nat a local bar in South Korea with some fellow soldiers on June 13, 2015, which carried \nover to the early morning of June 14, 2015. The bar had a roof-top area where the \ngroup was drinking. Applicant admitted that the group became very intoxicated.

At some point, the soldiers began disrobing their \nclothes. Several of the soldiers, including Applicant, took off all their clothes revealing \ntheir genitals. Later, a female soldier fell off the roof and was seriously injured. Applicant \nhad nothing to do with the fall. Applicant called his senior noncommissioned officer to \nreport what happened and the authorities responded. The Army conducted a full \ninvestigation of the incident and Applicant, along with the other participating soldiers, \nwere interviewed and provided sworn statements (See GE 3). (Tr. 25-29; GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s sworn statement to the Army investigator included admissions that he \nwas intoxicated that evening and took his clothes off while on the roof-top bar. One of \nthe other male soldiers admitted that all three male soldiers on the roof top exposed \ntheir genitals at some point. As a result of the Army investigation, Applicant was offered \nArticle 15 proceedings, which he accepted. He was charged with one specification \nunder UCMJ Article 134 (often times referred to as the General Article, which includes \ngeneral disorders that are deemed prejudicial to good and discipline). Specifically, the \nspecification alleged that Applicant \u201cengaged in activity that involved both the use of \nalcohol and the removal of clothing,\u201d to include exposing his underwear and genitals, in \na public place. His commander found Applicant guilty of the specification and punished \nhim with a suspended grade reduction, reduction of pay for two months, restriction to \nbase for 45 days, and extra duties for 45 days. Applicant has had no similar incidents \nsince then. (GE 3 (pp. 55-57, 59-61, 63-65); GE 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: In August 2017, Applicant received a debarment order from all U.S. \nbases in South Korea for two years. Applicant admitted to receiving the debarment, but \nvigorously denied the underlying alleged offense that led to the debarment. In the \nsummer of 2017, Applicant was completing his first year working for a government \ncontractor on a U.S. base in South Korea. During the time frame of 2016 through \nDecember 2017, the Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) conducted a wide scope \ninvestigation into drug activity on Applicant\u2019s base. Numerous military members were \nquestioned as part of the investigation. Applicant was the only contractor named in the \ninvestigation. According to a law enforcement report (LE report) prepared in December \n2017, concerning the drug investigation, Applicant was called in for questioning by CID \nagents on August 7, 2017. He was advised of his rights and declined to speak with the \nagents and requested counsel. According to Applicant\u2019s statement to his background \ninvestigator in September 2020, he answered the CID agent\u2019s questions about his drug \ninvolvement by denying any knowledge of drug activity and specifically denying his \ninvolvement in any such activity. A debarment order was prepared on August 10, 2017. \n(Tr. 35-36; GE 3, 7) \nThe LE report indicated that Applicant was questioned about possession of \nopiates with the intent to distribute. Aside from being named in the report, the report \ncontains no evidence that Applicant engaged in the suspected drug activity. No other \npersons of interest or suspects named Applicant as being involved in the distribution of \nopiates. Army judge advocates were involved in probable cause determinations for the \nsoldiers named in the report, but no such determination was made for Applicant. \nApplicant was never charged with any drug distribution offense either in South Korea or \nin the U.S. Applicant was never served with the debarment order. It only came to light \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen he came onto the base to renew his expiring identification card (ID). Applicant \ncredibly testified that when the debarment was issued there was only a month left on \nthe contract for which he was hired. After speaking with his supervisor, he was told that \nbecause of the short time remaining on the contract, that it was not worth fighting the \ndebarment action. He believed he left the contractor\u2019s employment on good terms. (35-\n41, 48, 50; GE 7) \nWhen he returned to the U.S., he sought to purchase a firearm, but was \nprevented from doing so because his name showed up on law enforcement databases \nthat precluded him from purchasing a firearm. He was told by his state\u2019s bureau of \ninvestigation that he was denied this right because his name appeared in the LE report \nlisted above as a drug-related person of interest. In December 2017, he filed a request \nwith the U.S. Army Crime Records Center to have his name removed from the report \nand resulting indexes. Upon receiving no reply, he filed a second request in June 2018. \nHe also filed similar request with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the FBI. \nHis name was removed from the databases in 2018 or 2019. He currently works in a \nposition as an armed security guard. (Tr. 22, 41-44; AE B-C, I-J) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant completed his May 2020 SCA concerning his employment \nhistory, specifically his employment with the defense contractor he worked for in South \nKorea from 2016 to 2017, by stating that his reason for leaving that employment was \nbecause his \u201ccontract ended.\u201d He credibly testified that he believed that was the reason \nfor his leaving the position. Although he had been debarred from the base, which in his \nopinion was totally unjustified, he spoke with his then supervisor who told Applicant that \nthe company would not fight the debarment because only one month remained on the \ncompany\u2019s contract. Applicant left on good terms with the contractor and believed he \ncould be hired by it in the future. He disclosed the debarment during his background \ninterview. He had no intentions of deliberately deceiving the government by giving the \nanswer he gave on the SCA. His SCA answers in other areas show that he listed \nderogatory information when it was requested, e.g. prior discipline received by former \nemployer (Section 13, # 6) and listing discipline he received in the Army (Section 15-\nMilitary History Summary, # 1). (Tr. 48-50; GE 1, 2; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: As noted above, in 2015, Applicant received punishment under \nArticle 15 of the UCMJ for a one specification of violation of Article 134, conduct \nprejudicial to good order and discipline. The prejudicial conduct was described in the \nspecification as engaging in activity that involved both the use of alcohol and the \nremoval of clothing, to include exposing his underwear and genitals, in a public place. \nApplicant admitted his drunkenness and disrobing in a sworn statement to the Army \ninvestigator. In completing his 2020 SCA, he listed the Article 15 as a prior disciplinary \nincident while in the military. He characterized his conduct as \u201cdrunken misbehavior.\u201d \nDuring his background interview, the investigator noted that when asked about the \nArticle 15 incident, Applicant denied being one of the persons taking off his clothes at \nthe bar. During his testimony, Applicant stated he did not recall making that statement to \nthe investigator. He also admitted he failed to correct this statement when he had a \nchance to review the document. His reason for not correcting the document was that he \nhad already provided truthful information during the Army investigation about taking his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclothes off and did not need to correct this incorrect information at this time. He had no \nintentions of providing deliberately false information to his background investigator. (Tr. \n54-56, 65-68; GE 2, 3 (See p. 55-57, 63-65)) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: During one of three telephonic interviews Applicant had with his \nbackground investigator(s), in one occurring on September 30, 2020, he described his \nmemories of how his 2017 debarment transpired when he sought to renew his ID on the \nSouth Korean base. He was never served with the debarment order (which is not a part \nof the record) before he attempted to renew his ID. It was only when he was at \ncustomer service and his name came up on the computer screen of the customer \nservice representative that Applicant was made aware that he had been the subject of a \ndebarment order. At that point, he did not know the reason for the debarment. Later in \nthe same background interview, Applicant was asked by the interviewer if he had any \ndrug activity to report. Applicant replied that he did not. The interviewer then brought up \nthe drug investigation from 2017 in South Korea that led to Applicant\u2019s debarment. \nApplicant denied any drug involvement implied by the investigation and described how \nhe was questioned by the military police in July 2017 and again denied any drug \ninvolvement or any knowledge of drug activity. He was allowed to leave after the \nquestioning and no further information was provided to him until he was stopped from \nrenewing his ID and told about the debarment. (GE 2 (p. 12))  \nDuring his hearing testimony, Applicant described his September 2020 \nbackground interview in the following exchange with his counsel: \nCounsel: And you did discuss during [your] interview in September 2020 \nabout the military police interview, correct? \nApplicant: Yes. \nCounsel: Were you ever asked during the September 2020 interview if the \nmilitary police questioning in August 2017 was the cause of your \ndebarment? Was that a direct question? \nApplicant: Not that I recall. \nCounsel: Did you voluntarily disclose during a subsequent interview in \nOctober 2020 that your belief was that the debarment was because of the \nopiate investigation? \nApplicant: Yes. \nCounsel: Did you ever omit or falsify any information related to the \nconnection between the debarment and the military police interview or \n[the] investigation in 2017 during any of your September or October 2020 \nclearance interviews? \nApplicant: No. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCounsel: Have you always attempted to be open and honest and forthright \nduring any investigation, security clearance, or otherwise? \nApplicant: Yes. (Tr. 57-59) \nI found Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. The Government did not call any \ninvestigator to testify at Applicant\u2019s hearing to clarify the summarized statement \nprepared or to rebut any of Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nIn April 2022, Applicant sought out and participated in a clinical psychological \nevaluation conducted by Dr. E, Ph.D., a board-certified psychologist. The evaluation \nincluded a clinical interview, a review of records (including the SOR, Applicant\u2019s \nresponse, and all the Government exhibits), and psychological testing. As part of his \nevaluation Dr. E stated the following: \nBecause of the concern about [Applicant\u2019s] personal conduct and integrity \nin the current security clearance matter, I interviewed him carefully around \nthe criteria associated with the range of personality disorders described in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition \n(DSM-5). [Applicant] does not exhibit signs or symptoms of any of the 10 \nDSM-5 personality disorders. He does not have symptoms of any of the \nCluster B personality disorders which are most commonly associated with \nunpredictable, poorly controlled, and disruptive thinking or behavior (i.e., \nantisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic \npersonality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder). (AE M) \nApplicant\u2019s psychological testing scores indicated that he was free from \ninterfering psychological symptoms and not indicative of any substance-related \nconditions, personality dysfunction, or behavior dysregulation. Dr. E then concluded his \nevaluation by stating: \n[Applicant] does not have any mental health or substance use condition \nthat could impact his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in the context \nof safeguarding classified information or working in a cleared setting. \nLikewise, I found no personality indicators or behavioral patterns indicative \nof risk for personal conduct problems that could impair his willingness or \nability to protect national security information. (AE M) \nApplicant presented letters of support from three senior non-commissioned \nofficers with whom he had served in the Army. All described Applicant\u2019s leadership and \nhis traits of honesty and integrity. All have held or currently hold security clearances and \nthey universally recommend that Applicant retain his clearance. Applicant provided \ncopies of his Army evaluation reports, and his awards and recognition while in the Army. \nApplicant also presented certificates from the successful completion of a behavior \nmodification course in 2021 and a drug and alcohol awareness course, also in 2021. He \nhas also seen a therapist twice a month since August 2021. He testified that he has \ntaken all these actions in an effort to better himself.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is \nillegal in that country; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, \nwhile legal there, is illegal in the United States. \nApplicant provided a credible explanation for why he left the contractor\u2019s \nemployment, which was because of the impending loss of the overall contract within \none month. While Applicant was, in his view, wrongfully debarred, he was not precluded \nfrom working for that contractor in the future and left on good terms. Deliberate \nfalsification was not established by the Government. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant previously listed the Article 15 he received in 2015 while stationed in \nKorea on his May 2020 SCA. He described the reason for the disciplinary action was \n\u201cdrunken misconduct.\u201d During the 2015 Army investigation into the incident that led to \nthe Article 15, he provided a sworn statement which included admissions to drunken \nconduct and his taking off his clothes in public. He did not recall denying to his \nbackground investigator that he was one of the persons who took off his clothes. It \nwould make little sense to deny his actions when he was previously on record admitting \nthe conduct. He admitted doing so in his hearing testimony. The Government did not \ncall the investigator to testify at the hearing in order to clarify the summarized statement \nor rebut Applicant\u2019s testimony. I conclude that the Government failed to meet its burden \nto establish that Applicant provided deliberate or intentional false or material misleading \ninformation during his interview. AG \u00b6 16(b) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nIt is clear from Applicant\u2019s unrebutted testimony that when he spoke with the \nbackground investigator about his debarment he answered that he was unaware what \nthe reason for the debarment was when he was notified about it in Korea. Later in the \ninterview, he was asked if he had any drug involvement to report. He did not. He then \nwas asked about the Army drug investigation in 2017 and he described what happened. \nApplicant credibly denied providing false or misleading information about this incident. A \nreview of the summarized interview with Applicant on September 30, 2020, established \nthat the questioning about this incident was ambiguous and inartful. The Government \ndid not call the investigator to clarify the ambiguities. Once again, the Government has \nthe burden to establish deliberate false or misleading information. It did not do so here. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nApplicant\u2019s Article 15 from 2015 and his 2017 debarment satisfy the disqualifying \nconduct listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;    \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant\u2019s actions which led to his 2015 Article 15 were not frequent and \nhappened under unfortunate, but unique circumstances. Nothing similar has ever \nhappened since that incident seven years ago. Sufficient time has passed to determine \nthat Applicant has changed his behavior. He has taken steps to alleviate any stressors \nthat could lead to similar behavior by engaging in therapy, having a psychological \nassessment done, and participating in behavior modification and alcohol awareness \nclasses. It is unlikely similar behavior will recur in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and \n17(e) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nWhile Applicant was debarred from South Korean military bases in 2017 because \nhis name came up during an investigation into drug activity there, no evidence was \npresented in the ensuing investigative report which implicated Applicant in any way of \ninvolvement with drug activity. Moreover, Applicant has always denied any involvement \nor knowledge about any drug activity. He has never been charged or suspected of drug \ninvolvement in any other context. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(f), apply to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, his contractor service, his Army awards \nand decorations, his Army performance appraisals, and his regular therapy and recent \npsychological assessment. These all factored into my assessment that Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct concerns that were established. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude the Government failed to establish personal conduct security concerns or \nApplicant mitigated the remaining personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant, when questioned, admitted that he did \nnot file his federal tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 as required by law. The SOR \nwas amended to add SOR 1.m. Applicant had no objections. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 55, has been legally married to his husband since 2015. (Tr. 17). \nApplicant completed his security clearance application on January 16, 2020. He obtained \nhis undergraduate degree in 2006. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1985 until \nJanuary 2007, receiving an honorable discharge. He obtained his first security clearance \nat that time. He has been with his current employer since 2018. (GE 1, 2) He has been \nemployed in the contracting field for many years, but he was unemployed for a few months \nin 2016. (GE 1) Applicant is a federal records manager. (Tr. 18) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debts in the amount of $92,062, \nincluding collection accounts and charged-off accounts. Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations and provided explanations. SOR allegation 1.m was amended to conform to \nthe evidence reflecting Applicant admitted that he did not file his Federal tax returns for \n2017 and 2018, but he believes he paid them. (Tr. 53) He has filed his 2020 and 2021 \nreturns. He does not know if he owes tax for the years that he did not file. (Tr. 54) \nApplicant acknowledged his delinquent debts, but stated that until 2017, his credit \nrating was above average and he was paying all bills. He was part of a two-income, two-\nperson family and met all financial obligations. His income at that time was about $12,000 \nto $14,000. Applicant lost a contract unexpectedly and suffered a loss of substantial \nwages. (Tr. 11) He found a position which lasted two years. Applicant took another \nposition which reduced his salary by two-thirds. He took the job so that he could pay \nhousehold bills, food, and lodging. (Tr.11) The income was not sufficient, so he took out \nloans and used credit cards. \nOver the past three years, Applicant has worked aggressively to remedy the \nfinancial situation. He took three jobs so that he could increase his income and make \npayments on accounts. He obtained a loan consolidation on June 11, 2021, so that he \ncould pay the bill listed on the SOR. (AE B) His husband has not worked since 2015, and \nhe still cannot work, as he is partially disabled and retired. (Tr.13, 44) They live apart as \nhis husband is in a retirement home in one state and Applicant is in another state. \nApplicant visits his husband about once a month due to rising costs in gas. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n As for SOR 1.g, a charged-off account in the amount of $17,600, he stated that \nhe settled the account for $8,494.His credit report states that he is paying on a partial\npayment agreement.

(Tr.\n39) There was no record of the payment. \n \n \nApplicant contacted the creditors and tried to negotiate with small payments, but \nno one was interested. The creditors wanted the entire sum or they would turn the account \nto collection. (Tr. 24) He understands it is his responsibility to pay the bills and thus has \nthe three jobs. Applicant presented information on the jobs from 2018 to 2022, including \nwage slips. (AE B) \nApplicant owns two residential properties which he purchased in 2007. The \nmortgage is solely in his name, but the properties are in both names. He believes the \nvalue of the two properties is about $500,000.

He is retired and unable to get a job due to a partial disability, \nbut he is now beginning to pay some bills due to social security. (Tr. 13) \nApplicant noted that he has had two renters in his home for the past three years. \nThey help pay for the rent. However, one had been homeless and gives whatever he can \nto help with the rent. (Tr. 21) One renter pays about $460 a month, and the other person \nnow pays about $250 a month. (Tr. 50) However, one is on disability and sometimes pays \nwhat he can. (Tr. 27) He also stated that the one renter has a child with another on the \nway. He treats the renters like family and plans on helping the one who is soon to have a \nbaby. Applicant purchased a vehicle to help transport the child. (Tr. 50) Applicant is \ncurrent on the mortgages and his two car payments. He currently has no collection \naccounts on his latest credit report. (AE C, Tr. 27) He helps the two renters financially \nbecause he is a generous man. He also pays for their cell phones. (Tr.51) \nAt some point Applicant obtained a loan for about $50,000 to pay the majority of \nhis debt. (AE C) He acknowledged that this was after notice of the SOR. (Tr.44) He made \npayments on the majority of the SOR debts, his mortgage, and car payments for the last \nnine months. (Tr. 26) Applicant presented a chart (AE A) that outlined the SOR accounts \nand the amount that he paid or settled for each account listed on the SOR and the date \nof the payment. However, he did not submit any evidence of bank statements that he \nactually made the payments. He currently has no collections on his credit line. (Tr. 27, \nGE 3) \nAs to SOR allegation 1.a, ($3,509) a collection account, he submitted his credit \nunion statement that showed he withdrew on June 16, 2021, an amount of to MCM. As \nto SOR allegation 1.b, a collection account for $824, he settled this debt for $464. As for \nSOR 1.c a collection account for $12,949, he settled the debt for $10,359. As for SOR \n1.d, a charged-off account for $4,440, Applicant settled for $2,519. As for SOR 1.e, a \ncharged-off account for $5,599, Applicant settled for $2,242. As for SOR 1.f, a collection \naccount for $9,702,there is no record of payment from his bank. (GE 3, AE D Tr.38) In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he settled the account in June 2021. \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs for SOR 1.h, another charged-off account to the same credit union.

(GE 3, Tr. 41) \nThe amended SOR allegation 1.m reflects the fact that Applicant, when \nquestioned, admitted immediately that he has not filed his federal income tax returns for \n2017 and 2018. (Tr. 53) He has filed his 2019 and 2020 tax returns. He has no idea what \nhe owes for the tax years 2017 and 2018. He stated that he is talking to the IRS, but when \ngiven another opportunity during the teleconference after the hearing was reopened, he \nhad no explanation or documentation for what he owes. As of the date of the post hearing \nconference, the 2017 and 2018 tax returns were not filed. \nApplicant currently earns $63.00 an hour at his major job. He follows a budget. He \nhelps his husband financially, but Applicant does not have disposable income. (Tr.45) \nApplicant has started a retirement account with about $8,000 in the account. He has \n$1,200 in his savings account. (Tr. 46) When he works his part-time job, he can earn \nabout $500 extra each week. However, his income before the crisis (2009-2010), when \nhe was working as an independent contractor, was $10,000 to $12,000 a month. (Tr. 47) \nApplicant explained that he only spends money on his car, food, maintenance, \nhousing expenses and his pets. He takes no vacations or days off. (Tr.48) He had to live \nusing credit cards for a time of more than two months when the contract ended. He did \nnot seek financial counseling. His credit report for July 2021 shows that almost all \naccounts have zero past due. (GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and AG 19(f) (failure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income tax returns as required.) \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are the result of losing a contract and a period of \nunemployment and lowered pay. He tried to keep his household bills paid for himself and \nhis husband, but at some point he had to use credit cards. He also helps renters who \nwere homeless. He was fine financially until 2017. His credit reports reflect that issue. He \ntook a loan after the issuance of the SOR to pay off the credit card debts.

He admitted that he \u201cput his head in the sand\u201d. He has made \ngreat strides toward his debts and is working with two credit unions to resolve two debts. \nHowever, Applicant has not filed his Federal income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. \nHe gave no explanation and was even given an opportunity to present documentation to \nmitigate. He did not have anything to submit. He admitted immediately that he has not \nfiled the returns as of yet. He stated that he became overwhelmed and accepts \nresponsibility. \nWith regard to his financial obligations and debts he is entitled to mitigation credit. \nHowever, his failure to file his Federal income taxes for two years has not been mitigated. \nAlthough candor at the hearing was established. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(d) are established. \nApplicant did not meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR \n1.m for not filing his taxes for two years. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 a through 1.l. \nfor Applicant. However, SOR 1.m h\n as not been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s military career and his candor and resolve to pay \nhis debts. I find that financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. Applicant has not \npresented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns raised by his failure to \nfile his federal income taxes for two years. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the \nGovernment. I conclude that it is not consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1. m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of three exhibits. (GEs 1-3) \nApplicant relied on five exhibits. (AEs A-E) and one witness (himself). The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on April 28, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of his filing a \nnon-state district tax return for tax year 2015 in June 2021. For good cause shown, \nApplicant was granted seven calendar days to supplement the record. Department \nCounsel was afforded seven days to respond. Applicant did not supplement the record. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly failed to file his federal and state tax \nreturns, as required, for tax years 2012 through 2015. Allegedly, these tax returns \nremain unfiled. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all of the alleged failure-to-file \nallegations with explanations. He claimed he filed these federal, state, and local district \ntax returns in June 2021 and was waiting for a response from the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS). \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old civilian engineer of a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never been married and has no children. (GEs-2; Tr. 27) He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2008 and completed additional post-graduate \nclasses between May 2008 and June 2012. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 27) Applicant did not report \nany military service and has never held a security clearance. (GEs 1-2) \nSince October 2015, Applicant has worked for his current defense contractor as \nan engineer. (GE 1; Tr. 28) Because the company he listed in his security clearance \napplication has a different name, and no longer sponsored him after March 3, 2022, \ninitial confusion arose over the status of his sponsorship. (HE 1) Current DOHA tracking \nentries confirm his sponsorship by his current employer under a different name, as of \nMarch 9, 2022. (H1) Whether the new sponsorship reflects a name change or a \ncorporate purchase of his old company is unclear. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nPreviously, Applicant was self-employed as a freelance data analyst (August \n2015-October 2015) for a start-up company and provided tutorial services between \nJune 2011 and August 2014. (GEs 1-2) Applicant has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nRecords document that Applicant did not timely file his federal, state, and local \ndistrict tax returns, as required, for tax years 2012 through 2015. (GEs 1-3) He is \ncredited with filing his federal tax returns for tax years 2012-2015 in May 2021. (AE B; \nTr. 25-26) Applicant is also credited with filing his state tax returns for tax years 2012-\n2014 in May 2021. (AE E; Tr. 30-31) According to a notice to Applicant, in July 2021, \nthe local district\u2019s office of tax and revenue processed his filed 2015 income tax return in \n2021 and denied his refund claim because his refund claim exceeded the maximum \ntime limit. (AE A) Applicant attributed his tax-filing lapses to being disorganized and not \nfocused on his tax filing obligations. (Tr. 29-30)  \nIn November 2021, Applicant received a notice from the IRS that the Service did \nnot accept his filed federal tax returns for tax years 2012-2015 due to the lack of a \nsignature on the late-filed returns. (AE D; Tr. 31) He did not refile his 2012-2015 returns \n(all signed) until March 2022 and has been denied his claimed refunds because his \nclaimed refunds were too late for consideration. (AE B; Tr. 31-32) Applicant is satisfied \nthat he does not owe the IRS or his state and local district taxing authorities any monies \nfor tax years 2012-2015. (Tr. 34-35) \nApplicant is current with all of his debts and earns $136,000 a year. (Tr. 28) He \nmaintains a strong credit standing (save for his filing lapses). \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any.  \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  . .

Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

See \nDirective 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His \nadmitted tax-filing failures are fully documented and create judgment issues as well over \nthe management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing failures are critical to \nan assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR \nCase No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

In the past, the Appeal Board has consistently \nimposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to provide documentation corroborating \nactions taken to resolve financial problems, whether the issues relate to back taxes, \nconsumer, medical, or other debts and accounts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd.

While Applicant is entitled to credit \nfor his work in the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome \nhis repeated failures or inability to address his tax-filing responsibilities in a timely way \nover the course of many years. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment \nhave not been established. \nApplicant\u2019s past failures to file his federal, state, and local district tax returns in a \ntimely and responsible way reflect adversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a \nsufficiently stable manner to meet the minimum requirements for holding a security \nclearance.

He \nhas a high school diploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor \nas a Senior CAD Designer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant incurred a number of delinquent debts owed to \nthe Department of Education for student loans, and consumer debts that were either \npast due, charged off or placed for collection totaling approximately $58,000. In his \nanswer, Applicant admits each of the delinquencies. Credit reports of the Applicant \ndated October 24, 2019; and March 22, 2021, confirm this indebtedness. (Government \nExhibits 5 and 6.)  Applicant has never applied for a security clearance before. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in August 2019.  Since then,\nthere have been no noted interruptions in his employment.  Prior to his current\nemployment, Applicant experienced multiple periods of unemployed from March 2019-\nAugust 2019; October 2017- February 2018; and February 2015-March 2015 that he\nstates attributed to his current financial problems.  Applicant explained that at certain\ntimes over the years, he has had to make the difficult decision of either paying off his\ncreditors, or keeping a roof over his family\u2019s head and food on the table.  When faced\nwith this decision, he has always puts his family first.  Applicant stated that he took out a\nnumber of student loans to further his education.  He had hoped to complete a college\nengineering program that he enrolled in.  However, because he needed to work full time\nto support his family, he could not complete the program.  In addition, he was laid off\nfrom work a number of times, through no fault of his own.  When this happened, he\ndefaulted on his student loan payments and has been unable to get back on track.  At\nsome point he also separated from his wife for a two year period, and this caused\nadditional financial hardship.  He and his wife have since reconciled their relationship\nand things have improved since he now has stable employment.  Applicant states that\nhe plans to enter into a payment plan for the student loans, and he also plans on\nresolving the other outstanding consumer debts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts are delinquent and of security concern: \n1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., and 1.r.

Applicant should have at least listed these two \narrests in response to Section 22, as they occurred within the last seven years. \nApplicant should also have listed his Felony charges set forth in allegations 2.g. \nthat occurred in September 2002, 2.h., that occurred in November 2001, 2.i., that \noccurred in April 2001, 2.k., that occurred in October 2000, 2.l., that occurred in May \n1999, and 2.p., that occurred in July 1994, as the question asks if he has EVER been \ncharged with a Felony.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not paid. At this time \nthere is insufficient information in the record to conclude that he is financially stable, or \nthat he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources available to handle \nhis financial obligations. There is no evidence in the record to show that any regular \nmonthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts. In fact, they all remain \noutstanding. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThere is some evidence in the record to show that circumstances beyond the \nApplicant\u2019s control contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. There were multiple \nperiods of unemployment, underemployment, and his separation from his wife. \nHowever, since August 2019, when he started working for his current employer he has \ndone nothing to show that he has addressed any of his delinquent debts. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. This guideline is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a while, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to copy with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but it not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s extensive criminal history coupled with his failure to answer the \nquestions about his police record accurately shows a pattern of irresponsible and \nunreliable conduct. Applicant not only failed to list his most recent arrests and charges \nthat occurred within the last seven years from the date he completed the application, but \nhe failed to read on to answer the questions accurately that ask him if he has EVER \nbeen charged with a Felony or charged with a drug or alcohol violation. Applicant\u2019s \ncarelessness or dishonesty shows poor judgment and unreliability. Applicant knew or \nshould have known to answer the questions on his application carefully and accurately. \nDeliberately concealing material information from the government on a security \nclearance \napplication \nraises \nserious \nquestions \nabout \none\u2019s \ncredibility \nand \ntrustworthiness. Carelessness shows immaturity and irresponsibility. In either case, \nnone of the mitigating conditions are applicable and Applicant does not meet the \neligibility requirement to access classified information. This guideline is found against \nthe Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not submit a \nresponse to the FORM.  Insufficient mitigation has been shown. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security \nconcerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.x. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.q. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(Transcript (Tr.) 19-26; \n40-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s 1998 and 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings and \ndischarges (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), as well as eight delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $96,000. These delinquencies consist of student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.d), and medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.j). Approximately $90,000 of the \ndelinquent debt in the SOR is for delinquent student loans. Applicant admitted all of the \nSOR allegations with additional comment. His admissions are adopted as findings of \nfact. (Tr. 18-20, 25-39, 43-49, 54-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-7; AE A) \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in January 1998. This bankruptcy \nwas discharged in April 1998. Applicant claimed that he filed this bankruptcy because \nhis ex-wife was incurring debt, but not contributing to their income because she was not \nworking. He claimed that he decided it would be better for him to discharge their debts \nbecause he thought he would have to pay all of it himself when he and his ex-wife split \nup. He had between $50,000 and $100,000 in debt consisting of credit cards and loans \ndischarged in this bankruptcy. (Tr. 25-26; Applicant's response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant filed another Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in April 2010. This bankruptcy \nwas discharged in August 2010. Under Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, \nthe petition listed two auto loans totaling $52,157. Under Schedule E, Creditors Holding \nUnsecured Priority Claims, the petition listed $24,239 in student loans. Under Schedule \nF, Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims, the petition listed claims totaling \n$364,055. The Schedule F claims included $82,155 in student loans. Applicant claimed \nthat he filed this bankruptcy because he had a lot of medical debt from the cost of care \nfor his stepdaughter who was gravely ill. He also claimed that he decided to file this \nsecond bankruptcy because he had abandoned his home as he decided the home was \ntoo small for his family to live in. Providing medical care for his stepdaughter and having \nspace for her medical equipment played a major role in this decision. After trying to \nnegotiate a settlement with his mortgage company, he abandoned the home and rented \nanother home. He did not attempt to sell his home because he claimed it was in \ndisrepair.

The loans first became \ndue sometime in 2010, but Applicant consistently applied for forbearance or deferrals \nfor several years. Applicant may have made one or two payments on his student loans \nafter 2010, but he also testified that he was not sure about making these payments and \nhe may not have made any payments. The February and August 2020 credit reports \nreflect a last activity date of October 2018. The July 2021 credit report reflects a \ndelinquency date of October 2018 for both debts. Applicant provided no documentation \nto support his contention that he made any payments on these loans. He provided no \ndocuments to corroborate whether or when his student loans were in forbearance or \ndeferred prior to being referred to collections. He claimed that he did not realize that his \nstudent loans were delinquent until his March 2020 clearance interview, but \nacknowledged that he had not checked on their status for some time prior to that. \nApplicant tried to contact the government to rehabilitate his student loans for a couple of \nmonths beginning in March 2020 but couldn\u2019t get through to anyone. He speculated that \nhis inability to connect with someone was because of the pandemic. After these \nattempts in spring of 2020, he stopped trying to rehabilitate his student loans until about \nDecember 2021. In December 2021, he entered into a student loan rehabilitation \nagreement with the government and his loan servicer that calls for him to contact the \nloan servicer to begin to make payments on his debt. He plans to contact his loan \nservicer in August 2022. He admitted that he contacted the government in December \n2021 to attempt to rehabilitate his student loans because he received the SOR. I have \ntaken administrative notice that all federal student loans were eligible for placement in a \ndeferment status as of late March 2020 at the earliest. Therefore, available evidence \nshows that Applicant was delinquent on these debts prior to any placement in a \ndeferment status. (Tr. 29-35, 46-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4-7; AE A) \nThe delinquent medical debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.j have been settled. \nThe activity dates listed on the credit reports for the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nthrough 1.h are no later than September 2018. The credit reports for the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j do not list activity dates. These SOR medical debts arose from a medical \nemergency when Applicant suffered from atrial fibrillation (a-fib) in 2018. In addition to \nhis direct medical expenses, Applicant also paid about $300 to $400 per month for \nmedication related to his a-fib from 2018 until late 2019 or early 2020 when he switched \ncardiologists and began paying about $75 per month. In April 2021, Applicant borrowed \nmoney from his brother and settled all the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.j. He \nprovided corroborating documentation that he settled these accounts. After settling \nthese accounts, he borrowed money from his retirement savings in order to pay his \nbrother back. He admitted that receiving the SOR was what motivated him to take \naction to settle these medical debts. (Tr. 35-36, 51-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 4, 5) \nApplicant earns $52.26 per hour and works full-time. He occasionally works \novertime. He made approximately $80,000 in 2021, but that amount was lower than \nexpected because he suffered a broken arm and could not work for about three and a \nhalf months.

However, before \nher child passed away in about 2011, his wife had a hard time finding steady \nemployment because of the time-consuming medical care that her daughter required. \nApplicant\u2019s wife handles all the finances because Applicant claims that he has limited \naccess to electronic devices in his workplace. He and his wife pay $1,850 per month for \nthe mortgage on the house they purchased in 2014. They have a $600 per month car \npayment for a 2018 SUV they purchased in 2018. They pay approximately $300 per \nmonth for electricity and pay the full balances on their credit cards every month. \nApplicant testified that he has between $15,000 to $20,000 in his checking account and \n$5,000 to $10,000 in his savings account. When asked why he did not use this money \ntowards his SOR debts, he claimed that he did not have it at the time because he was \nliving apart from his wife and they were paying for two places to live. Applicant and his \nwife do not follow a written budget and he could not specify how much money he has \nleft over at the end of each month after paying his bills. He has not received any \nfinancial counseling other than what was required for his bankruptcies. (Tr. 21-25, 39-\n42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nIn addition to the aforementioned causes, Applicant attributed his financial issues \nto the 2013 government shutdown and a ruptured biceps tendon he suffered in 2013 \nthat kept him out of work for five to six months. He had to take a loan from his \nretirement account at this time in order to keep up with his financial obligations. He also \nsuffers from silicosis, or scarring of the lungs, as a result of breathing in fine particles of \nsilicon at a worksite where he worked from 1999 through 2002. (Tr. 28-29, 56-57) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has twice afforded himself fresh starts through Chapter 7 bankruptcies, \nthereby discharging hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. Despite his latest \ndischarge, he once again found himself with financial problems. He has made, at most, \none or two payments on a significant amount of student loan debt that has been due for \nover a decade, and has been in collection for several years. He also had delinquent \nmedical debt that went unresolved for many years. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by divorce, his health problems, his \nstepdaughter\u2019s health problems and untimely passing, and marital issues with his \ncurrent wife. These causes were beyond his control. However, he also suffered financial \nissues because of his voluntary decision to abandon his home without attempting to sell \nit because he decided he needed a bigger place. This cause was not beyond his \ncontrol. \nWhile I will consider Applicant\u2019s bankruptcies as part of his overall history of \nfinancial stability, Applicant's bankruptcies occurred in 1998 and 2010. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b are mitigated as the latest bankruptcy occurred 12 years ago. \nThe student loan debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d have not been mitigated. \nThose debts are in a deferment status because of the pandemic and because of \nApplicant\u2019s actions after he received the SOR. However, Applicant had already \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndefaulted on his student loans prior to deferment. When student loans are placed in a \ndeferment status after they are in default, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are not excused in \nthe context of security clearance eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 7, 2021). Also, an applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after \nhaving been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n26, 2019). Applicant stated that he intends to bring and keep his student loan debts \ncurrent once his deferment period ends. However, intentions to pay debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is documentary corroboration that the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nthrough 1.j have been resolved through payment. However, Applicant resolved these \ndebts after he received his SOR and admitted that receiving it was what motivated his \nactions. As with Applicant\u2019s timing of his attempts to resolve his student loans, his \nsettlement of his medical debts when he learned his clearance was in jeopardy is of little \nmitigative value. AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) only partially apply to the medical debts. \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat he made a good-faith effort to pay his student loans and medical debts. While he \nreceived mandatory financial counseling through his bankruptcy, he had financial \nproblems again after the counseling. His prolonged history of financial problems with \nlittle to no track record of financial stability fails to show that his financial issues are \nunlikely to recur. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The financial considerations security concern is \nnot mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      Subparagraph 1.c-1.j:                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Department Counsel\u2019s request and supporting \ndocumentation are attached to the record as a hearing exhibit. The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old communications operator employed by a defense \ncontractor since May 2012. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 2008 \nto February 2012 and received an honorable discharge. He has held a security clearance \nsince March 2010. \nApplicant has been married since December 2014. He has no children. He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2011, while he was on active duty. \nIn 2012 and 2013, Applicant worked overseas as a contractor, working as the site \nlead of a satellite communications facility. He was laid off from September 2013 to \nDecember 2013 due to a reduction in force. He was offered a job in the United States, \ndrove across the country on the way to his new job, and visited a close friend from his \nArmy service. While visiting his friend, where he met his future wife, a citizen of Thailand \nliving in the United States. In May 2014, they married on Veterans Day. (Tr. 37-39.) \nIn January 2019, Applicant decided to accept a job overseas in order to earn more \nincome. His wife stayed in the United States. (GX 1 at 24.) He anticipates staying \noverseas until his company\u2019s contract expires in 2025. (Tr. 42.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse became a U.S. citizen in December 2020. (Tr. 41.). She \ncurrently works and lives in the United States. Her parents never married. Her father is a \ncitizen and resident of Thailand. He did not attend their wedding. He was a Buddhist \nmonk, and at some time he worked as a pipefitter on a farm until he lost a leg in an \naccident. (AX J at 2; Tr. 44-45.) He does not speak English and Applicant does not speak \nThai. Applicant had no contact with him until June 2019, when his father-in-law \u201cfriended\u201d \nhim and his wife, using an emoji instead of text. (Tr. 47.) Applicant and his wife have had \nno contact with his wife\u2019s mother, who currently lives in Sweden, since 2016.

A breathalyzer registered a blood-alcohol level of 0.136. He was arrested and \ncharged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The headlight charge was \ndismissed because his vehicle had automatic headlights. The DUI charge was reduced \nto having physical control of a motor vehicle. He completed a two-day intervention \nprogram and completed four sessions with a psychiatrist. He was fined $1,000, with $800 \nsuspended, and was placed on unsupervised probation for two years, which he \ncompleted. (Tr. 50-51; AX F.) \nIn September 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with having physical \ncontrol of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. This incident happened after \nApplicant was laid off and returned to the United States. He spent a night drinking and \nreminiscing with an old high school friend. He realized that he was intoxicated and should \nnot try to drive. Instead, he decided to sleep in his vehicle with the motor running to \noperate the car\u2019s air conditioner. He was charged with having physical control of a vehicle \nwhile under the influence of alcohol. He was convicted, fined $250, sentenced to 30 days \nin jail, with 27 days suspended, and placed on probation for one year. (Tr. 53-55; GX 4 at \n1; AX G.) \nIn April 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle under \nthe influence of an intoxicant. He testified that this incident occurred after his best friend \nfrom high school visited him and his wife. Applicant consumed a mixed drink and two \nbeers over a period of about six hours. He drove his guests from the restaurant to their \nhotel, which took about 45 minutes. After leaving his guests at the hotel, he started to \ndrive home. On the way home on a four-lane highway, he encountered a construction \nzone where the right three lanes were closed at the point where there was an exit ramp \non the right. Applicant parked his car behind a police vehicle and took photographs of \nwhat he considered a dangerous situation. (AX H.) A police officer approached him and \nasked what he was doing, and he explained that he thought the conflicting road signs \ncreated a dangerous situation. Another police officer approached, said that he smelled \nalcohol, asked Applicant if he had been drinking, and then arrested him for DUI. (Tr. 58\u00ad\n61.) Applicant\u2019s best friend submitted a statement corroborating Applicant\u2019s description \nof their moderate consumption of alcohol during the hours preceding Applicant\u2019s arrest. \n(AX K.) \nApplicant hired an attorney, who requested discovery of the recordings from body \ncameras and traffic camera and subpoenaed the two police officers involved. According \nto Applicant, no evidence was disclosed and the police officers did not appear to testify. \n(Tr. 62.) The record does not reflect a police report, field sobriety test, breathalyzer test, \nor any other evidence reflecting that he was under the influence of an intoxicant. In \nFebruary 2017, the charge was dismissed with prejudice. (GX 4 at 2; AX I.). Applicant \nreported his arrest to his supervisors and his security manager. (Tr. 63-64.) \nApplicant was diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in 2019. He has last \nseen by a medical professional in October 2021, when his laboratory tests showed mildly \nelevated liver enzymes.

He presented evidence that a DeRitis Ratio, known \nas AST: ALT, that is greater than 1 may indicate long-term complications such as fibrosis \nand cirrhosis. (AX E.) Applicant\u2019s ratio has remained below 1.00 for about six years. (AX \nD.) Applicant testified that he intends to avoid consuming alcohol and control his diet in \norder to control his liver disease. (Tr. 66.) He has found avoiding alcohol easy, because \nhe has other interests that do not involve use of alcohol. (Tr. 68.) He does not consume \nhard liquor, and he limits himself to one or two beers with family or close friends on rare \noccasions. (Tr. 71.) \nApplicant attended two meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in October and \nNovember 2021. (AX B.) He testified that he attended the meetings on advice from his \nattorney to see if they would be useful. He did not feel like he \u201cfit in,\u201d because he does \nnot consider himself an alcoholic. He did not attend any further meetings. (Tr. 67, 70.) \nApplicant\u2019s team leader since February 2022 has been a team leader for three and \na half years and has been working on an overseas contract for 15 years. He described \nApplicant as a \u201cstellar\u201d performer, one of the few basically bright team members that he \nhas encountered during his 15 years of overseas service. Applicant is his \u201csecond,\u201d \nmeaning that he takes over the day-to-day functions of the site in the team leader\u2019s \nabsence. The team leader has not observed Applicant being intoxicated, in large part \nbecause alcohol is not allowed on the team base and is not available in the country. He \nrecommends that Applicant be granted eligibility for access to classified information. (Tr. \n16-22.) \nApplicant\u2019s co-worker from late 2017 to early 2022 submitted a statement that he \nnever observed any indications of alcohol abuse during the time they worked together. \n(AX M.) A close friend of Applicant, who has known him since 2020 and is aware of the \nprevious alcohol-related incidents, believes that Applicant has moved on from his past \nalcohol-related behavior. (AX O.) Applicant\u2019s operations support manager, who has held \na security clearance for 21 years on active military duty and 18 years as a defense \ncontractor, submitted a stating describing Applicant\u2019s duty performance as \u201csuperior to \nhis peers.\u201d (AX L.) \nA friend and co-worker, who has known Applicant since 2016 and worked with him \ndaily at two overseas locations, worked as Applicant\u2019s subordinate in June 2021 and has \nbeen a co-worker since February 2022. They spend much of their off-duty time together \nat movies or looking for good restaurants. He described Applicant as a \u201cnumber one team \nplayer,\u201d highly respected among his peers, subordinates, and supervisors. He \nrecommends \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d that Applicant be granted a security clearance. (Tr. 23\u00ad\n33.) \nThailand is a constitutional monarchy.

However, in July \nto December 2020, there were numerous anti-government protests. The U.S. Department \nof State has issued a Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) advisory for the southernmost \nprovinces of Thailand due to civil unrest and terrorist attacks. \nThe Royal Thai Police and Royal Thai Armed Forces share responsibility for law \nenforcement. Although the civilian authorities were given more authority after the March \n2019 elections, they do not maintain full authority over security forces, who continue to \ncommit a variety of abuses. Thailand continues to have significant human rights abuses. \nChina is seeking to expand its power projection in the region. The Chinese Navy \nconducted recent port calls in Thailand, and China conducts regular military exercises \nthat include Thailand. There is no evidence that Thailand targets the United States for \nmilitary or economic intelligence and no evidence that China uses resources in Thailand \nto gather intelligence or technology from the United States. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse. ISCR Case No. 01-\n03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); see also ISCR Case No. \n09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011). Although Applicant has no personal connection \nto his wife\u2019s father, he has not rebutted the presumption that he has some sense of \nobligation to him. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a disabled former monk with no apparent connections \nto the government of Thailand. However, the relative obscurity of family members does \nnot provide a meaningful measure of whether an applicant\u2019s family connections pose a \nsecurity risk. ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above a \nState Department Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent \nto the Level 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d). The State Department Level 3 \ntravel advisory for Thailand due to civil unrest is sufficient to raise these two disqualifying \nconditions as well as the potential conflict of interest in AG 7(b). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s connection to his father-in-law is solely by \nvirtue of his marriage. They are unable to communicate, except by emoji. Although \nThailand has defense-related and commercial contacts with China, it is not hostile to the \nUnited States. There is no evidence that Thailand targets the United States for military \nor industrial intelligence, and no evidence that China seeks to use citizens of Thailand \nor former citizens of Thailand to gain military or industrial intelligence from the United \nStates. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant met his wife while she was living and working \nin the United States. Although she has cultural ties to Thailand, evidenced by the fact \nthat she chose to have a marriage ceremony in Thailand, followed by a ceremony in the \nUnited States a month later, she has strong ties to the United States, demonstrated by \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher decision to come to the United States in 2011 and become a U.S. citizen in 2020. \nHer father is her only family member in Thailand. Her sister owns a business in the United \nStates, and her mother lives and works in Sweden. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:\u201d Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant admitted all three alcohol-related arrests alleged in the SOR. However, at the \nhearing, he submitted evidence that he was not guilty of the offense in April 2016. Based \non my review of the evidence, I conclude that the evidence was insufficient to establish \nthat he was under the influence of an intoxicant on this occasion. However, the evidence \nestablishes the alcohol-related conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b and raises the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s last arrest was more than six years ago, and \nthe evidence of maladaptive alcohol use for that incident is sparse. The last arrest for an \nalcohol-related incident supported by substantial evidence was in September 2013. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is established. Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive alcohol \nuse, and he has modified his drinking, motivated in large part by his health problems. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is partly established. Applicant received court-ordered psychiatric \ncounseling in 2007, but no other treatment other than his attendance at two AA meetings. \nHowever, he has established a pattern of modified consumption based on the advice of \nthe medical professionals treating his liver disease. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests establish the following disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established for the reasons set out in the discussion \nof Guideline G and the evidence of his outstanding performance at work. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B, G, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, \nsincere, remorseful, and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines B, G, and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his foreign family connections, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 34 years old and unmarried with one child. He currently lives with his girlfriend and her three children. He stated that he is their sole support. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since 2020 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 3 at Sections 13A, and 17; Item 2 at 4.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR alleged that Applicant had 12 past-due debts totaling approximately $41,000. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated May 19, 2020; November 24, 2020; and June 1, 2021. (Items 5, 6, and 7.) Applicant stated that most of his financial problems were connected to his immaturity and \u201cnot being responsible with his financial situation.\u201d The money he makes in his current job has allowed him to change his financial circumstances for the better and get a handle on his finances. One way he did this was paying off the note on his car, which freed up money for other debts. Applicant also stated his credit score has been improving as he has been paying his debts off. Finally, Applicant is current on his child support obligations. (Item 2 at 4-5, 7-8, 10; Item 4 at 8",

The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 30, 2021. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old and unmarried with one child. He currently lives with his \ngirlfriend and her three children. He stated that he is their sole support. Applicant has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor since 2020 and seeks to obtain national security \neligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 3 at Sections \n13A, and 17; Item 2 at 4.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 12 past-due debts totaling approximately \n$41,000. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated \nMay 19, 2020; November 24, 2020; and June 1, 2021. (Items 5, 6, and 7.) Applicant stated \nthat most of his financial problems were connected to his immaturity and \u201cnot being \nresponsible with his financial situation.\u201d The money he makes in his current job has \nallowed him to change his financial circumstances for the better and get a handle on his \nfinances. One way he did this was paying off the note on his car, which freed up money \nfor other debts. Applicant also stated his credit score has been improving as he has been \npaying his debts off. Finally, Applicant is current on his child support obligations. (Item 2 \nat 4-5, 7-8, 10; Item 4 at 8; Applicant Exhibit A.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed a credit union $28,048 for \nfour different accounts in collection. The credit union informed Applicant that he only had \none charged-off account with them in the amount of $13,219. Applicant made a payment \narrangement with the credit union\u2019s 3rd  party collection agency to make monthly payments \nof $200 to pay off the debt. He submitted documentary evidence from the collection \nagency that he has been making consistent monthly payments for over a year starting in \nJune 2020, before issuance of the SOR. These debts are being resolved. (Item 2 at 4, 6, \n9; Applicant Exhibit A at 1, 3-6.)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.e.

He intends to pay \nthis debt as he has the funds available. This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A at \n1.) \n1.f. Applicant admitted owing $1,724 for an account placed in collection by a \ntelephone company. Applicant reached an agreement with the 3rd  party collection agency \nfor a reduced amount of $1,044. He paid this amount in full on July 8, 2021, as shown by \ndocuments from the collection agency. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A at 1, 7-\n8.) \n \n \n1.g and 1.h. Applicant admitted that he owed two debts to this 3rd  party collection \nagency in the amount of $1,396. Applicant paid both of these debts in full, along with an \nadditional debt not alleged in the SOR, in the total amount of $1,851 on July 9, 2021. \nThese debts have been resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A at 1, 9-10.) \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admitted owing $949 for a past-due telephone bill. Applicant reached \nan agreement with the 3rd  party collection agency for a reduced amount of $574. He paid \nthis amount in full on July 14, 2021, as shown by documents from the collection agency. \nThis debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A at 1, 11-12.) \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admitted owing $530 for an account placed in collection by an \napartment complex. Applicant paid the full balance plus fees and interest in the amount \nof $574 on July 11, 2021, as shown by documents from the 3rd  party collection agency. \nThis debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A at 1, 13-14.) \n \n \n1.k. Applicant admitted owing $400 for an account placed in collection by an \napartment complex. Applicant paid the full balance on July 9, 2021, as shown by \ndocuments from the 3rd  party collection agency. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit \nA at 1, 15-16.) \n \n1.l. Applicant admitted owing $254 for a past-due cable bill. He paid the full balance \non July 9, 2021, as shown by documents from the collection agency. This debt is resolved. \n(Applicant Exhibit A at 1, 17-18.) \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegarding his debts Applicant stated, \u201cI have lowered the amount owed from \n$41,000.00 to $22,531.00.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant owed 12 past-due debts in the amount of approximately $41,000 as of \nthe date of the SOR. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn the summer of 2020 Applicant began his new job. The record shows that he \nreached out to his largest creditor (SOR 1.a through 1.d) and began making consistent \nmonthly payments of $200 starting in June 2020, soon after starting his current \nemployment. As of July 2022 he had paid over $4,000 on that debt. With the exception of \nthe debt set forth in 1.e, Applicant has resolved all the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant stated, he has resolved approximately half of his past-due indebtedness and \nevinces a credible intent to resolve the remaining half. I find that his conduct amounts to \na good-faith effort to resolve these debts in a responsible manner consistent with \nsomeone who wants to receive and deserves national security eligibility. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. (Internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted.)  \n \nGiven his resources, Applicant has initiated a pragmatic approach to the \nrepayment of his debts and has taken significant steps to resolve all of his indebtedness. \nApplicant has the knowledge and ability that will allow him to resolve his other debts and \nstay on a proper financial footing. He has fully mitigated all the allegations in the SOR. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation. He has minimized the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

His June 22, 2020 SCA asked whether he failed to timely file or pay \nfederal income taxes in the previous seven years, and Applicant answered, no.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d    \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant did not provide proof of resolution of the 12 delinquent debts totaling \n$25,393 alleged in the SOR. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still \nconsidered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nF mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

However, \u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in \nwhole or in part, due to circumstances outside his control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether he maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant \ndid not provide supporting documentary evidence that he maintained contact with his \ncreditors. He did not provide evidence of any payments to the SOR creditors. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant failed to timely filed his federal income tax \nreturn for TY 2018. He did not send his employer\u2019s and his wife\u2019s W2s along with his TY \n2018 tax return, and the IRS wrote him asking for less than $2,000. The IRS is supposed \nto receive copies of W2s from employers, and the IRS evidently calculated his and his \nspouse\u2019s tax liability. Applicant and his wife are separated. He said he asked his employer \nto provide a corrected W2; however, he did not receive it. His spouse plans to file her \nfederal income tax return as married filing separately. Applicant can refile his tax return \nas married filing separately. He did not show whether he owed any federal income taxes \nfor TY 2018. \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling. He did not provide \ndocumentary evidence showing he was not responsible for any of the unresolved SOR \ndebts or explaining why he was unable to make greater documented progress resolving \nthe SOR debts. There is insufficient evidence showing Applicant\u2019s multiple failures to pay \ndebts were prudent good-faith decisions. His financial delinquencies are likely to continue \nand recur. His finances continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 lists a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b including: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant\u2019s June 22, 2020 SCA asked whether in the last seven years he had any \ndebts in collections, charged-off debts, defaulted on any loan, or been delinquent over \n120 days on any debt. He answered, no, and he did not disclose any delinquent debts in \nhis SCA. He had 12 delinquent debts totaling $25,393. \nApplicant\u2019s June 22, 2020 SCA asked whether he failed to timely file or pay federal \nincome taxes in the previous seven years, and Applicant answered, no. He failed to \ndisclose on this SCA that he did not file a complete tax return for TY 2018 because he \nfailed to include his and his spouse\u2019s W2s, and in 2020, he received correspondence from \nthe IRS indicating he owed taxes for TY 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s SCA asked clear and easily understood questions about Applicant\u2019s \ndebts and taxes. He intentionally failed to disclose his delinquent debts as well as his tax \ndebt. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes one condition that could mitigate security concerns relating to \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose accurate information on his SCA, \u201c(a) the individual made \nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before \nbeing confronted with the facts.\u201d \nDuring his July 20, 2020 OPM interview, Applicant said without being confronted \nthat he had: (1) defaulted on debts; (2) debts in collections; and (3) was more than 120 \ndays\u2019 delinquent on debts. He remembered some delinquent debts and the OPM \ninvestigator told him about other delinquent debts on his credit report. He also said without \nbeing confronted that he failed to file his and his spouse\u2019s W2s with their joint federal \nincome tax return for TY 2018, and he owed less than $2,000 to the IRS. AG \u00b6 17(a) \napplies, and the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b that he intentionally omitted information \nfrom his SCA are mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 16 has two disqualifying conditions which are relevant to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, \nand 2.e. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) state: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of:  . . .

AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e)(1) are established. The disqualifying conditions will \nbe further discussed in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges Applicant was fired for violating several policies. Applicant \nthreatened a client and received a reprimand. He admitted to a staff member that he made \nthe threat. He left adolescent boys and girls unattended, and he was fired. He admitted \nhe left them unattended, but said he had to leave to use the restroom. He did not describe \nany efforts to have another staff member attend the clients in his absence. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges Applicant was fired for sleeping while on duty as a security \nguard. His said he was photographed by a coworker with his head on his hand. His denial \nthat he was sleeping is not credible. His failure to accept responsibility for sleeping on \nduty shows a lack of responsibility. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges Applicant brought his child to work, and he is a security guard. \nThis rule violation resulted in a two-week suspension from work. Applicant said his \nbabysitter did not come to his house to care for his child. Applicant did not explain what \nefforts he made to find another babysitter or daycare. He did not indicate he called his \nemployer before bringing his child to work. There is not enough information to mitigate \nthis violation of his employer\u2019s policy against bringing children to work. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s rule violations. He did \nnot provide credible assurances that he will comply with rules and policies. His rule \nviolations continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 36 years old, and he is seeking employment as a DOD contractor. In \n2013, he married, and his son was born in 2013. He separated from his spouse in 2018. \nThe record does not contain any letters describing Applicant\u2019s good work performance, \nlaw abiding character, or diligence in the protection of classified documents or sensitive \ninformation. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the delinquent SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. It is \nunclear why he did not provide evidence about his income, expenses, and efforts to \nresolve the debts in the SOR. Applicant was terminated from employment twice and \nsuspended for two weeks from a different job for violating rules. His lack of responsible \nfinancial action and violations of his employer\u2019s rules raise unmitigated questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

I have carefully applied the law, \nas set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 8, 2021, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on August 24, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with clarifications. I have \nincorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2006 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He married in 2010, separated in 2012, and divorced in 2014. \nHe has an 11-year-old child. He has been employed by his current employer, a federal \ncontactor, since May 2018. (Tr. 14-17, 41-42; GE 1) \nIn approximately July 2014, Applicant was reprimanded by his employer after \narriving at work hungover and smelling of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He showed up for work \nafter drinking the night before. He did not recall exactly how much he had to drink, but he \ndid not consume alcohol in the morning before work. He stated that he probably drank \nbetween 8 and 10 beers the night before. His supervisor smelled alcohol on him. His \nsupervisor had him work in the office by himself and told him his conduct was \nunacceptable, and not to do it again. He received a written reprimand. He believed his \nemployer had a three-strike policy. He understood that if he did not comply with the rules, \nhe would lose his job. Applicant continued to consume alcohol, but thought he drank less. \nHe agreed that sometimes his drinking impacted his ability to get to work on time. He \ntestified that he was unhappy and was using alcohol to cope. He drank every day. Later \nhis life improved. (Tr. 17-19, 59-64) \nIn July 2015, Applicant received a second reprimand from his employer as a result \nof his excessive tardiness due to his alcohol consumption. He could not recall how many \ntimes he was late for work due to his alcohol consumption, but estimated it was a hand-\nfull of times when he did not feel well. He said that some of his tardiness was not always \nattributed to his alcohol consumption. He testified that no one else at work mentioned his \ntardiness, but his supervisor noticed it. He received a second reprimand and forfeited a \nbonus he likely would have received. He testified that his drinking at this time was \nproblematic. He understood that he could lose his job. He said after his second reprimand, \nhe made people at work aware if he was going to be late and he modified his drinking \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Tr. 18-20, 64-70) \nIn October 2016, Applicant\u2019s employer sent him on a temporary duty assignment \nfor five months in a foreign country.

He said he was a few minutes late for work. He could not \nrecall the woman\u2019s name. He knew she had an accent. He held a security clearance at \nthe time. He said he just did not think of this incident as a foreign contact until it was \nbrought to his attention during his background interview. He did not report the contact as \nrequired. He explained he just did not think anything of it and even if he had been sober \nhe would not have reported it. (Tr. 19, 70-80) \nApplicant said that at the time, none of his fellow employees mentioned that he \nsmelled like alcohol or that he had sex with the foreign woman. When he returned to the \nUnited States, a fellow employee who was with him on the trip, reported Applicant\u2019s \nconduct to a supervisor. He was told by the supervisor that even though this was his third \nstrike, he was being given one last chance, but the next time there was an issue, he would \nbe terminated. He was suspended from work-related travel due to this incident. Applicant \nsaid he modified his behavior by consuming less alcohol. (Tr. 63, 77-82) \nIn May 2017, Applicant testified that he had gone to a bar around 7 p.m. and \nconsumed between 8-10 drinks that included beer, mixed drinks, and shots. He left the \nbar between 12:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. and felt fine to drive. He offered his friends a ride. \nIn his statement to a government investigator in June 2019, he said he felt \u201cbuzzed\u201d but \nnot intoxicated. He admitted the way he felt would produce lower reaction time and \nimpaired judgment. He was driving about 45 mph and hit the car in front of him. He pulled \nhis car to the side of the road. Someone called the police. The car he hit had a driver and \npassenger. When the police arrived, he was asked if he had been drinking, which he \nadmitted. His breathalyzer reading was .195%. He was arrested and charged with DUI \nresulting in personal injury. He stated that after impact the other driver got out of the car \nand was angry, and they had words. He said he thought the passenger in the other car \nwas injured, but he did not recall, and he vaguely remembered dealing with his insurance \ncompany and an injury was mentioned. He had two passengers in his car, both had been \ndrinking with him. Neither were injured. (Tr. 20-22, 82-94) \nApplicant pleaded no contest to the charge and was found guilty of DUI with \nproperty damage and sentenced to 12 months of supervised probation, assessed fines \nand court costs totaling approximately $1,650, and he was required to complete alcohol \ntreatment. He testified he also had to complete 50 hours of community service and his \nlicense was suspended for six months (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). (GE 1-2) \nApplicant could not recall if he reported the DUI to his Facility Security Officer at \nthe time, but the FSO was made aware. He said he told his supervisor. The car crash \nhappened during the workweek and he was detained for 36 hours, so his girlfriend called \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor to tell him why he was not at work. He was subsequently \nterminated from his employment in June 2017, as a result of his repeated issues with \nalcohol. He testified that he then modified his drinking.

The SW noted that Applicant was actively \nengaged in the program, but \u201ca little non accepting of a problem with alcohol.\u201d (GE 3) He \nalso noted that tolerance plays \u201ca pretty significant part in his lifestyle\u201d and he exhibits \n\u201cthe defense mechanism of minimization more often than I feel comfortable.\u201d (GE 3) His \nprognosis was good if he was involved in a support program, such as Alcoholics \nAnonymous or a church-based program, or other program. Without a support program \nhis prognosis was fair. As part of the program he completed 22 group counseling sessions \nand 3 individual sessions. The SW advised Applicant that if he wished to follow up with \ngroup treatment he could do so free of charge. (Tr. 21-22, 95-97; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that as part of his counseling he and the counselor discussed \nfamily issues and genetic predisposition. He testified that he has known for a long time \nthat his mother had a DUI, and she has always consumed alcohol, and it is part of their \nrelationship. During his 2019 interview with a government investigator, he disclosed that \nhis mother is an alcoholic and has consumed alcohol his whole life. She has participated \nin inpatient rehabilitation treatment. He said her alcohol use is now under control and is \nnot an issue. His half-brother, who is now deceased and was in and out of prison, was an \nalcoholic. He testified that he did not feel comfortable going to AA or a church-based \nsupport system. He says his girlfriend, his 11-year-old son, his mother and a family friend \nare his support group. He said his girlfriend does not drink much. His mother encouraged \nhim to slow down his drinking. She lives in a different state. He did not know why he did \nnot take advantage of continuing counseling with the SW, which is free. Applicant testified \nthat while on probation he did not consume alcohol. When he was released from \nprobation, he celebrated by drinking alcohol. (Tr. 23-24, 96-104, 107-108, 118-119; GE \n3) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 2019 interview with a government investigator, he explained \nthat his alcohol consumption started to slowing increase beginning in 2010 when he drank \nabout once a week to almost daily in 2017 when he was arrested for DUI. At first, he \nwould typically have at least a six-pack of beer, that then increased to 9-10 beers daily \nuntil his DUI. (Tr. 44-45; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he has modified his drinking by not drinking every day, but \nhe drinks a couple of times a week and has between 8 and 12 beers at a time, when his \nson is not present. He said he does not do this every week. He said in the past two weeks \nhe only had two beers. He explained that this is how he modified his drinking. He \npreviously was drinking daily. He said 8 to 10 drinks will make him intoxicated. He only \ndrinks at home now, does not go to bars, and is not endangering anyone. He believed he \nwas alcohol dependent, but he would like to believe he is no longer. He no longer feels \nphysically or mentally dependent on alcohol. He said his use was a product of his \nenvironment, which has changed. He stated that he no longer drinks and drives.

(Tr. 25-26, 32-33, 103-107, 113-115, 119-122) \nApplicant testified that he and his ex-wife share custody of their child. He would \nhave physical custody three to four days a week and then he and his ex-wife would switch \nthe days the following week. He could not recall if while they were together if she \ncommented on his drinking. He admitted he would consume alcohol when he had his \nchild in his physical custody. His ex-wife addressed his drinking with him after his DUI \narrest and told him he had a problem. He does not know if she was aware he consumed \nalcohol when he had custody of their son. He admitted being intoxicated when he had \nphysical custody of his son, but could not estimate or recall how many times. He estimated \nabout 75% of the time when he had physical custody of his child he was drinking alcohol, \nuntil 2017, when he had his DUI. He testified that he did not drink and drive with his son \nin the car. (Tr. 46-51) \nApplicant was living with his girlfriend from about 2011 to 2018. His girlfriend and \nhe would consume alcohol together. His girlfriend also had a small child living with them. \nThere was a three to four-year age difference between the children. Applicant and his \ngirlfriend would share a 12-pack of beer, each consuming 6, while they had the children. \nHe said their consumption was over a five-hour period. At some point his girlfriend voiced \nconcern about their drinking habits. Applicant agreed with her that they were consuming \ntoo much alcohol. They would abstain for about a month, then resume when one of them \nshowed up with alcohol. He estimated they abstained about four or five times. They would \nhave alcohol-related arguments. At one point, she wanted him to quit, and he did not want \nto at the time. Their relationship ended after an alcohol-related argument. (Tr. 44, 51-58) \nApplicant testified that his best friend MC talked to him about his drinking and his \nneed to quit. They would talk several times a year after Applicant had consumed alcohol \nand described MC as a shoulder to cry on. MC finally gave him an ultimatum that they \ncould no longer be friends if he continued to consume alcohol. They are no longer friends. \nApplicant admits alcohol has had a negative impact on his life, due to job loss, loss of a \nfriendship, and loss of a relationship. He testified, despite the negative impact alcohol has \nhad on his life, he does not know why he has not chosen to abstain from alcohol \nconsumption. He feels he is in a better place now that he is not reliant on others and he \nis independent. (Tr. 103-105, 109-110) \nApplicant has not participated in alcohol counseling since his court-ordered \ntreatment ended in May 2018. In his March 2021 answer to the SOR, he stated he \nintended to modify his relationship with alcohol and attend counseling to manage his \ndrinking habits. He also provided an exhibit from March 2021 stating that he intended to \nmodify his drinking and attend counseling. When questioned at his hearing if he had \nattended counseling, he said no. At his hearing, he said he now intends to abstain from \ndrinking alcohol and post-hearing he provided a letter of intent to abstain from drinking \nand attend counseling.

(Tr. 26-31; AE A, B, C, D, E, H) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impair condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with an alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was reprimanded by his employer in July 2014 after arriving to work \nhungover and smelling of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He was reprimanded by his employer in \napproximately June 2015 as a result of excessive tardiness resulting from his alcohol \nconsumption (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He was reprimanded by his employer in October 2016 after \narriving late and smelling of alcohol at his work assignment at a U.S. Government facility \nin a foreign country, and as a result he was suspended from work-related travel (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). He was arrested in May 2017 for DUI after he was involved in a car accident. He \npleaded no contest and was found guilty. He was required to attend alcohol treatment \nand in May 2018 he was diagnosed with Alcohol Dependency in remission (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.f) His prognosis was good with involvement in a support program and a fair \nprognosis if he was not involved. He is not involved in a support program. He was \nterminated from employment in June 2017 as a result of his repeated issues with alcohol \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). The evidence supports the application of the all of the above disqualifying \nconditions, except AG \u00b6\u00b6 22 (e) and 22(f). \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleged that Applicant failed to seek further counseling and continues \nto drink alcohol regularly, contrary to the recommendations received incident to the court-\nordered treatment program. It is true that he failed to seek further counseling and \ncontinues to drink alcohol regularly, but a review of SW\u2019s report does not support that he \nwas prescribed a treatment program. He was told counseling was available, but it was \nnot ordered, and there were no other recommendations stated in the report. Therefore, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) do not apply to this allegation. However, the facts about his drinking \nmay be considered in assessing his credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, \nand in a whole-person assessment. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along\nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established\n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant repeatedly had problems at work related to his abuse of alcohol. He was \ngiven four chances to change his behavior before he was fired after his DUI arrest. He \nhas repeatedly stated after each incident that he modified his drinking. He testified that \nhis modification is to consume about 8 to 12 alcoholic beverages a couple times a week, \nbut not every week. In his March 2021 letter of intent, he stated that he intended to \nparticipate in counseling to modify his alcohol consumption, but admitted at his hearing, \nover a year later, that he had not followed through. He then provided another letter of \nintent, now stating he would abstain from alcohol consumption and attend counseling. \nApplicant tacitly acknowledges his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, but has not \nprovided sufficient evidence of his actions to overcome his problem. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) \nand 23(c) do not apply \nApplicant completed the court-ordered DUI treatment program, but his prognosis \nwas only good if he had a support group and fair without one. His testified that his mother, \nwho is an alcoholic and continues to drink and a friend are his support group. There were \nno specific recommendations provided by SW as far as aftercare, only that it was free if \nApplicant chose to participate. AG \u00b6 23(d) has some application because he has \ncompleted a treatment program. I am unable to find that he has an established pattern of \nmodified consumption. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply. \nApplicant continues to abuse alcohol despite the negative impact it has had on his \nemployment, friendships, and relationships. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I cannot find that future questionable behavior is \nunlikely to recur. Despite the serious and potentially devastating impact his alcohol abuse \nmight have on his future, both professionally and personally, Applicant has not made a \nserious commitment to change. I have considered that he has not had an alcohol-related \noffense since 2017, but this alone is not enough to mitigate the security issues raised by \nhis alcohol consumption. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed) focuses on whether the \nalcohol abuse was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is \nrecent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period \nof time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse to include his multiple \nincidents at work; incidents away from work; habitual drinking; diagnosis of Alcohol \nDependent, in remission; court-ordered treatment; opportunity to attend counseling free \nof charge; multiple declarations that he modified his drinking habits after each incident; \nmultiple declarations that he was seeking counseling; and his most recent declaration \nthat he would abstain from drinking.

(ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \nThe evidence is insufficient to conclude that Applicant has changed his behavior. \nHe has not taken the necessary steps to address his problem with alcohol, despite \nrepeatedly promising to do so. I cannot find that there are changed circumstances or that \nhe has demonstrated successful rehabilitation. I have considered that he has not had an \nalcohol-related incident since his DUI arrest and that is some mitigation, but it is \ninsufficient to conclude that his behavior was infrequent, happened under unusual \ncircumstances and is unlikely to recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe evidence supports the negative impact that alcohol has had on Applicant\u2019s \nwork and life. Of grave concern are the risks he takes when he consumes alcohol, such \nas having sex with a foreign national, while on assignment in a foreign country after he \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nhad over indulged in alcohol, and consuming alcohol while caring for his son.

While there is a true and correct copy of the SOR in the \nhearing office file, the copy of the SOR that was mailed to Applicant (and which he mailed \nback, with an answer to each allegation noted in the margin) erroneously contained the \nname of a different applicant. The language of each allegation in the SOR copy he \nreceived is identical to the correct copy of the SOR in the file, and to which the parties \nreferred at the hearing. To rectify the error, I amended the Answer by changing the name \nin the caption so it referred to Applicant (as the caption of this decision does), and not to \nsomeone else. This was done without objection, and no substantive allegations were \naffected. (Tr. 13-15) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.o, with a narrative explanation.

(Tr. 44) He estimated that he earned about $59,000 in \nincome in 2021, and estimated a similar income in 2020. (Tr. 30-32, 43-44) \nApplicant said he incurred debts through schooling and a repossessed auto he \ncould not afford when he left the Navy. (Tr. 28-29) He also had other debts that he thought \nwere resolved when he left, and incurred more debts after his income dropped in civilian \nlife. (Tr. 84-85) His wife is largely a homemaker caring for their young children. \nApplicant acknowledged that when he was in the Navy, the DOD issued him a \nletter of intent (LOI) to deny his clearance, for financial reasons, in 2013. He was granted \na conditional clearance in 2014, contingent on documentation of monthly financial \nstatements to his command. He did not have to participate in formal credit counseling \nbeyond keeping his command informed of his financial plans. (Tr. 10, 33, 45-47) The LOI \nand the DOD\u2019s decision are not in the record. Applicant acknowledged that his financial \nplans and structure deviated after he was granted a clearance. He took out a car loan of \n$600 a month. (Tr. 47) \nWhile in the Navy, Applicant was arrested on a domestic battery charge after \nbecoming intoxicated, and received non-judicial punishment. (This offense was not \nalleged in the SOR and is not considered as disqualifying conduct). His wife was also \nsuffering from a difficult medical condition (unrelated to the domestic offense). Applicant \nsought guidance from a chaplain, and these factors prompted him to leave the Navy and \nreturn to civilian life. As noted, he was discharged honorably. (Tr. 47-48, 70-72, 85-86; \nAE K) \nIn addition to working full time, Applicant is also attending technical school full time \nto earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. (Tr. 29) His current schooling is \ncovered under the GI Bill. (Tr. 93-95) He works a flexible schedule so he can be home to \nattend school and help with child care. He has a long and lengthy commute to and from \nwork, to a different metropolitan area from where he lives. (Tr. 32-33) \nApplicant has a few thousand dollars in a 401k plan at work. (Tr. 50) He estimated \nthat during winter, with high heating bills, he incurs about $4,500 in monthly expenses. \nThis is also about what he earns each month including about $400 monthly from the GI \nBill. He generally breaks even financially, but has little to no money saved in his bank \naccount, and lives paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 50-52, 82, 88-89, 93-95) Applicant is \nworking off his other smaller debts, and does not want to incur new debt, while trying to \nprovide for his family. (Answer; Tr. 27-29, 81, 84) He wants to further his career and earn \nmore income, pay his debts, and buy a home. He loved sonar work in the Navy, and \nwants to be able to do similar work as a contractor. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant purchased a used car in May 2020.

It was incurred when Applicant \nlived in the neighboring state after he left the Navy. He believes the debt has been paid, \nbut is not certain. (Tr. 36, 55; GE 4 at 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,260) is an account placed for collection by a phone company. \nApplicant testified that earlier this year he negotiated a $500 settlement, to be paid at the \nend of March 2022. (Tr. 35-36, 56-58; GE 5 at 2) The record closed before this payment \nwas documented, but I consider it resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($369) is a car insurance bill placed for collection. It remains unpaid, \nthough Applicant has attempted to settle it. (Tr. 58-59; GE 5 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($841) is an unpaid lease from an apartment where Applicant lived \nwhen he was in the Navy. He disputed the bill, since he thought his living expenses in the \nNavy were covered, but says his wife told him he still owes it. He now intends to pay the \ndebt. (Tr. 59-61; GE 4 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,672) is a bill placed for collection. Applicant admitted the debt but \nis unsure what it is for, though it might be a cell phone bill. He has attempted to learn\nmore. It remains unpaid, though at $3,462, less than alleged. (Tr. 61-62; GE 5 at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($4,679), 1.g ($5,606), and 1.h ($4,994) are federal student loan debts \nplaced for collection. They were delinquent as of December 2020. (GE 4 at 3) Applicant \nmade several monthly $5 payments on his student loans in 2020 and 2021, through a six-\nmonth loan rehabilitation program. His federal student loans are now consolidated and in \ndeferment or forbearance because he is in school. (AE D, AE G, AE H, AE I, AE J; Tr. \n37-41. 62-66) In addition, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security \n(CARES) Act, the Biden Administration has extended the COVID pandemic relief \nprogram, under which federal student loan payments are deferred, through August 2022.  \nApplicant estimated that he has about $15,000 to $20,000 in student loans from \nhis undergraduate education prior to joining the Navy. (Tr. 38-41) This is confirmed by a \nrecent credit report. (GE 5 at 3) Applicant mistakenly believed he did not have to pay \nthem, or they were deferred, while he was in the Navy. He also did not make payments \non these loans after leaving the Navy. (Tr. 65-66) He said his current schooling is covered \nby the GI bill.

(Tr. 67-68; GE 5 at 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($26,044) is a charged-off account relating to an auto repossession. He \nbought the auto in 2016, when he was in the Navy, trading in his wife\u2019s car. Applicant said \nhe owed $17,000 when the vehicle was repossessed, and that, after it was sold at auction, \nhe owed $11,000. The Government\u2019s evidence indicates that he owes about $18,200 \nafter the resale. The debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 28, 34, 68-69; GE 5 at 2;)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($4.405) is a credit account that has been charged off. Applicant and \nhis wife used the account for personal expenses, like holidays and trips. He also used the \naccount for a loan on a motorcycle that he bought in 2017, right before he left the Navy. \n(Tr. 69-73) He sold the motorcycle but GE 5 indicates that for the account at SOR \u00b6 1.k, \nApplicant owed over $7,000, as of June 2021, and the debt remains outstanding. (Tr. 73-\n74; GE 5 at 3;) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($973) is an account that has been charged off. Applicant did not \nrecognize the debt, though it is listed on his credit reports.

Evidence shows that \nthe account has been charged off at $4,954. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 75-77)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($874) is an electricity bill placed for collection.

(GE 2 at 8) \nApplicant submitted proof that another, unalleged delinquent debt, to a military \ncredit card account, had been paid in April 2020.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern multiple debts, including student \nloans, an auto repossession, and other consumer and utility accounts, which became \ndelinquent both during and after Applicant\u2019s time in the Navy. The SOR debts are listed \non Applicant\u2019s credit reports and he admits them. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has numerous unresolved financial delinquencies. He had a difficult \ntransition to civilian life as he did not anticipate the financial impact of leaving the Navy \nand had difficulty finding steady employment with a decent income. Yet he also had \nfinancial issues while in the Navy, as evidenced by his acknowledgment of a prior financial \nSOR. His financial issues have continued for several years, and are ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \nFor similar reasons, AG \u00b6 20(b) has only limited application. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems began in the Navy due to spending beyond his means. His financial issues \nincreased after he left the Navy and he fell further behind on his debts, due to limited \nfinancial resources. However, as his debts began due to overspending, they are not \nlargely due to circumstances beyond his control. And even assuming that conditions like \nhis underemployment were largely beyond his control, he did not establish that he has \nacted responsibly to address and resolve his delinquencies. \nApplicant has pursued some credit counseling, both online and through the VA. \nBut he has not provided sufficient evidence that his debts are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans are from a prior period of education. They became \ndelinquent like most of his other debts, in similar circumstances. Applicant made small \npayments in 2020, as required, to rehabilitate his student loan debts before the CARES \nAct took effect, and his loans are now deferred and no longer past due. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies \nto his student loans, but otherwise, AG \u00b6 20(d) has little application. While he has made \nsome efforts to contact his creditors and negotiate settlements or other repayments, he \ndid not provide enough evidence to support a finding that he has made a good-faith effort \nto rectify his financial issues. To do that, he needs to establish more of a track record of \nsteady payments towards his debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a history of financial instability, \ngoing back to his days in the Navy. Applicant\u2019s debts will remain a security concern until \nhe shows a documented track record of good-faith efforts to resolve them. This is not to \nsay that he cannot become eligible for access to classified information in the future if he \naddresses his debts responsibly and becomes more financially stable. But the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. He and his wife have been married since 2002. They have two teenage sons. Applicant graduated from high school in 1991 and joined the Navy. He served in the Navy on active duty from 1992-2001; he then joined the U.S. Army Reserve for about a year. He then returned to active duty with the Navy and served from 2003-2013 when he retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2001. (GE 10; Tr. 17, 28, 32-35, 82) After leaving the Navy, Applicant worked part-time and was then hired as a security officer for another government agency (AGA). He worked there from 2013 to February 2018, when he was terminated for failing to report a traffic accident. (GE 1 at 16-17) 2 Applicant was on patrol and pulled out into traffic. He heard a thump, looked back, and saw a motorcyclist on the ground. He returned to the scene and asked the driver what had happened. The other driver said Applicant pulled in front of him. Applicant did not agree with that, but did not argue. The other driver was not injured. Applicant saw the driver\u2019s backpack, and thought he was in college and concluded, or assumed, that the driver did no",

Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 28, 2021, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On June \n29, 2021, Department Counsel amended the SOR, adding three allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.j, and 1.k) under Guideline F.

On April 5, 2022, DOHA issued \na notice scheduling the hearing for May 25, 2022, to occur by video teleconference \nthrough an online platform. On May 24, 2022, during a conference call with the parties, \nApplicant indicated that he was not prepared to proceed with the hearing the next day. \nThe hearing was continued for good cause shown until June 8, 2022. (Tr. 7) An amended \nnotice of hearing was duly issued. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Applicant appeared on video through his cell \nphone, while sitting in his car. While this was unusual, I note that I had opportunity at all \ntimes to see and hear him, and no audio-visual difficulties were evident. He had the \nhearing exhibits available to him. Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s Exhibits \n(GE) 1-10. Applicant testified and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-F. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 23, 2022. \nI held the post-hearing record open until June 29, 2022, to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional information. He timely submitted 64 pages of documents \nwith exhibit labels as noted here. The exhibits are identified as AE H through AE V (there \nis no AE G) and described as follows: AE H (2017 Tax documents); AE I (regarding home \nimprovement); AE J (GE 6, GE 7, GE 8 with updates in margin notes); AE K (2022 \nperformance award); AE L (performance evaluation 2016-17); AE M (mortgage \nmodification 2017); AE N, AE O, AE P (military retirement pay, discharge, disability); AE \nQ, AE R (reference letters); AE S (paystubs from contractor C); AE T (paystubs from \nemployer U); AE U (computer company employer paystubs); and AE V (updated SOR \nresponse as of June 28, 2022). All of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits (AE H-AE V) are \nadmitted without objection.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.i, and 1.k, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.h and \n1.k, each with a brief explanation. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He and his wife have been married since 2002. They \nhave two teenage sons. Applicant graduated from high school in 1991 and joined the \nNavy. He served in the Navy on active duty from 1992-2001; he then joined the U.S. Army \nReserve for about a year. He then returned to active duty with the Navy and served from \n2003-2013 when he retired as a petty officer first class (E-6). He earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2001. (GE 10; Tr. 17, 28, 32-35, 82)  \nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant worked part-time and was then hired as a security \nofficer for another government agency (AGA). He worked there from 2013 to February \n2018, when he was terminated for failing to report a traffic accident.

He heard a thump, looked back, \nand saw a motorcyclist on the ground. He returned to the scene and asked the driver \nwhat had happened. The other driver said Applicant pulled in front of him. Applicant did \nnot agree with that, but did not argue. The other driver was not injured. Applicant saw the \ndriver\u2019s backpack, and thought he was in college and concluded, or assumed, that the \ndriver did not have enough money to afford to pay for the damage, so he offered to pay \nfor some of the damage, including to the motorcycle\u2019s headlight. After a while the driver \nreported the incident to Applicant\u2019s employer, the AGA. Applicant was terminated \nbecause he failed to report the incident, which occurred while he was on duty. Applicant \nsaid he understood that the offer to pay the other driver looked like a cover up, but that \nwas not his intention. \u201cI just felt bad for him,\u201d he said. Applicant considered contesting his \ntermination but did not have the financial means to hire legal counsel to do so. (Tr. 35-\n49, 62-63) \nApplicant was briefly unemployed after he was fired, but then found work as a \nsecurity manager for $16 an hour. (AE T) This was a significant decrease from his prior \nsalary of $88,000 a year with the AGA. (Tr. 41, 64, 112; GE 1) In about January 2019, he \nbegan working security with another contractor, making an annual salary in the mid-\n$40,000s. He was promoted in mid-2020, and his annual salary rose to the mid $70,000s. \n(Tr. 112-114)  \nSince January 2022, Applicant has worked as an information technology (IT) \nconsultant for a government contractor. He earns $30.77 an hour in that job, which is full \ntime. (AE U) He recently began working in security at another contractor job, for which he \nalso needs a clearance. He earns $21 an hour in that job, working 20-25 hours a week. \nHe holds a clearance now and also held a clearance in the Navy. (Tr. 12, 42-43, 112-113; \nAE S) \nApplicant also receives $1,452 a month in retirement pay. He also is a 100% \nservice-connected disabled veteran. He receives disability pay of $3,746, recently \nincreased from $2,800 per month. (AE N, AE O, AE P; Tr. 46-51) \nApplicant testified that he first encountered financial trouble while at his last duty \nstation in the military, because he was not making enough money. (Tr. 34; GE 10) He \nfiled for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 in 2010, and it was discharged in 2014. \n(GE 3; Tr. 30, 44) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant began getting phone calls from creditors in 2017 \nHe then lost income after he was terminated by the AGA and took a significant pay cut in \nhis next job. This led him to fall behind on his debts. He acknowledged that he did not \nmonitor his online bill-paying and income stream. (Tr. 29-30, 43-45, 57-61) His mortgage \npayment also increased from $2,400 to $2,600 per month and he could not meet his \nfinancial responsibilities. (Tr. 67-69; Answer; AE A) In 2017, he was offered a mortgage \nmodification, with monthly payments of $2,416. (AE M) \nOn his SCA, Applicant listed debt consolidation and various debts.

(Tr. 65-66) In January 2019, Applicant again filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection. He declared assets of $933,000 and liabilities of $535,000, monthly income of \n$6,807 and monthly expenses of $5,581. (GE 2 at 12) Applicant participated in credit \ncounseling during the bankruptcy process, as required. The bankruptcy was dismissed in \nOctober 2019 for failure to make payments. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 30) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He indicated \nthat he and his wife could not afford the bankruptcy plan payments of $2,000. The \nbankruptcy trustee also noted that Applicant had unfiled federal income tax returns. (Tr. \n68; GE 2 at 60) \nApplicant acknowledged that during this period, from about August 2019 to \nNovember 2021, he and his family did not pay their mortgage. Due to a federal \nmoratorium on evictions, the family remained in the home. (Tr. 69-70) In November 2021, \nthey moved into a rental property. (Tr. 30. 69-70) Applicant asserted that the home they \nowned was foreclosed on, but he did not owe anything to the mortgage company because \nhe surrendered the house. (Tr. 103) Applicant has been current on his rental payments \nof $2,300 a month since December 2021, including a $4,400 security deposit. (AE E) \nIn January 2022, Applicant cashed out his 401k retirement (about $11,000) to \naddress his debts. He said he has between $400 and $700 at the end of each month after \npaying the household expenses. He has little to no savings currently. He tries to keep a \nbudget but does not have a formal one. He did pursue credit counseling and budgeting \nfrom Navy Relief. He was advised to declare bankruptcy, which he did in 2019. He said \nhis financial issues were generally attributable to falling behind on his bills trying to provide \nfor his family. (Tr. 51-55) Applicant hopes to be debt free by the end of 2023. (Tr. 31, 101) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($35,850) is a student loan account placed for collection. (GE 8, 9) The \nloans date back to at least 2001, when he earned his associate\u2019s degree, and were \ndelinquent by 2004, when he owed almost $21,000 in past-due student loans. (GE 10; \nTr. 86) They became delinquent again in about 2014. He thought they were covered in \nhis bankruptcy discharge but they were not. He said he made partial payments until about \n2018 when he lost his job. Applicant made $5 monthly payments from January 2021 to \nMay 2021 so he could be considered for deferred payment. (Tr. 82-89) The student loan \nis now with a different creditor, and payments are deferred until June 2022. (Answer; GE \n6; AE A; Tr. 77, 107-109) He will soon be required to pay $108 per month. (AE V) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($10,071) is a home improvement account, opened in 2015, now placed \nfor collection. He now owes $10,359 (GE 6, 7, 8, 9) He has a payment plan in place for \n$200 monthly payments, to start in July 2022. He says he owes only $2,100. (Answer; Tr. \n27, 89-92; AE A, AE I, AE V) Applicant mistakenly relies on AE I to conclude that he owes \nonly $2,150 on this delinquent debt; however, AE I relates to a different home \nimprovement company. They are different accounts, and SOR \u00b6 1.d is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($4,026) is a charged-off debt to a bank. (GE 6, 7, 8, 9) Applicant said \nhe called the creditor in January or February 2022 and made a few payments before then. \nHe has a payment plan in place for $250 a month starting July 2022 and the total amount \nowed is $3,772.

(GE \n6, 8, 9) Applicant set up a payment plan to pay off the two accounts and said they were \npaid off in January 2022. He provided no receipts but credit reports show a zero balance. \n(Answer; AE A, AE V; Tr. 93) These accounts are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($263) is a medical debt placed for collection. (GE 8) The account has \nbeen paid. (AE C; Tr. 95-96) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($5,778) and SOR 1.j. ($2,877) are two judgments filed entered against \nApplicant in favor of an HOA, in 2020 and 2016 respectively. (GE 4; GE 5) Applicant \nindicated that he initiated a payment plan to resolve both HOA judgments in April 2022. \n(AE A) He paid $1,000 in April 2022 and $200 in May 2022 (AE D) Applicant asserts it is \none debt, not two, and believes he owes around $7,000 total. (Tr. 96-101) His post-\nhearing documentation did not include any additional payments since May 2022. (AE V) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k concerns Applicant\u2019s 2017 federal income tax return, unfiled as of the \ndate of the SOR amendment. Applicant knew that tax returns are usually due by April 15 \nof the following year. (Tr. 70-71) His 2017 tax returns were unfiled at the time he filed his \n2019 bankruptcy, as noted. Applicant and his wife take their tax returns to a nationally \nknown tax preparer. They did not alert them that he was late on his tax filing. (Tr. 79) \nApplicant did not file the returns on time (by April 2018) because of his recent \ntermination (February 2018). (Tr. 75) He said he filed his 2017 returns in April 2020. (Tr. \n72-74) Post-hearing documentation from his tax preparer shows that his 2017 state and \nfederal returns were prepared at that time. Applicant owed $4,145 in federal income taxes \nand $114 in state income taxes for tax year 2017. (AE H at 18) There is no evidence that \nApplicant has paid or is paying these delinquent taxes. He said he had no other unfiled \nreturns and no other delinquent federal or state taxes. (Tr. 70-82) \nAccording to his 2019 bankruptcy petition, Applicant has several other debts, some \nof which remain unpaid and unresolved, since the bankruptcy was dismissed. Applicant \nasserted that he had paid some, and did not recognize others. The bankruptcy petition \nwas filed jointly with his wife. (Tr. 101-107; GE 2) \nApplicant was recognized in February 2020 with an award at work. (AE K) He \nachieved excellence or exceeded expectations in an earlier performance evaluation, from \n2016-2017. (AE L) Applicant\u2019s references attest to his reliability, professional judgment, \nhis value as an asset to his employer, and to the importance he places on his family. (AE \nQ, AE R) \nApplicant understands the security significance of his financial history of late \npayments due to mismanagement and loss of employment. He is working to address his \ndebts. He has reduced his spending, set a budget, and set up repayment plans. He takes \npride in his prior military service and wants to continue to serve the country.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Applicant has had prior bankruptcies, subsequent financial delinquencies, and \na past-due tax return. The following AGs are applicable:  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added), the \nDOHA Appeal Board set forth why failure to file tax returns is a security concern: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant has a long history of financial instability and mismanagement, going back \nto his days in the Navy. He has resolved some of his debts, but most of his delinquencies \nremain ongoing and unresolved. His student loans go back almost 20 years, and remain \nlargely unaddressed. The fact that they are now in deferment is not enough to eliminate \nthe fact that they have been delinquent for years in the past. He has not established that \nhis debts are due to circumstances that are unlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on \nhis judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has had some recent unemployment and decreased income. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore has some application. However, his financial delinquencies predate those \ncircumstances. Applicant is credited with working two jobs in an effort to pay his debts \nand rehabilitate his finances. Some of his debts have been paid, but others remain largely \nunaddressed. Applicant has settlement offers and payment plans for some of his debts \nbut these debt-resolution efforts are recent, and he has not established enough of a track \nrecord of steady payments towards them to warrant full credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d). \nApplicant participated in some credit counseling during the bankruptcy process. \nHe has taken some steps to limit his expenses, such as moving into a rental home. \nHowever, he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that his debts are being \nresolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. \nApplicant denied the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.h and established that they have been \npaid and resolved. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(e) apply to them.  \nApplicant failed to file his 2017 federal income tax return on time as required. That \nreturn was due in April 2018, shortly after he was terminated from his job with the AGA. \nThe return was likely filed by his tax preparer in April 2020, though this is not clear from \nthe record. This is the only past-due tax return alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s documents \nindicate that as of April 2020, he owed about $4,100 in past-due federal taxes for 2017, \nand about $100 in state taxes as well. The past-due taxes are not alleged in the SOR, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbut can be considered in weighing mitigation. Applicant did not provide sufficient \ninformation for full application of AG \u00b6 20(g). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is a retired, disabled veteran, with a long career in the defense industry. \nI credit this positive evidence in Applicant\u2019s favor. But he also has a long history of \nfinancial issues, going back to his time in the Navy. He has filed for bankruptcy protection \ntwice, and was unable to meet the payment plan for the second bankruptcy. He did not \npay his mortgage for about two years before moving into a rental home. He has numerous \nold and unresolved past-due debts, and he has yet to implement a reasonable plan to \naddress them. Applicant needs to establish a consistent track record of financial stability \nin order to mitigate the financial security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate financial \nsecurity concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.
