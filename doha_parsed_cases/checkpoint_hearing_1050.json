Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 18, 2016. On \nFebruary 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nB. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n\n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 25, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 18, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on April 23, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor June 12, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibit (GX) 1 was \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the \ntestimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record \nopen until July 17, 2019, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through T, which were admitted without objection.   \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 25, 2019. \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout India. The request and supporting documents are attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HX) I. I kept the record open to enable Department Counsel to expand her request \nfor administrative notice, and she timely submitted HX II. I took administrative notice as \nrequested by Department Counsel. On my own motion, I took administrative notice of the \nfacts recited in HX III. The facts administratively noticed are set out below in my findings \nof fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old systems analyst employed by a defense contractor since \nMarch 2016. He was born and educated in India. He entered the United States in \nFebruary 2008 to accept a job offer from a U.S.-based company. He became a U.S. \ncitizen in June 2015. In February 2011, he married a naturalized U.S. citizen, who is \nemployed as a business analyst and manager for a U.S.-based corporation. (Tr. 29.) He \nand his wife have a five-year-old child. He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant testified that his immigration to the United States was the culmination of \na long-cherished dream that he held since childhood. As a child, he was captivated by \nbooks and television programs about the United States. As he grew older, he was \n\u201cexposed to the different challenges in the Indian society, widespread poverty, lack of \neducation, superstitions, corruption in government and law enforcement, class systems, \ngeneral indifference towards human life, lack of respect for human life, bad infrastructure \n[and] limited opportunities.\u201d (Tr. 20-21.) He and his wife have immersed themselves in \nstudying the history, culture, and government of the United States. (Tr. 24.) He grew up \nin a lower middle-class family in India, and is grateful for the quality of life he and his \nfamily now enjoy in the United States. (Tr. 24.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens and residents of India. His mother has \nnever worked outside the home. (Tr. 33.) His father was a traffic controller for the Indian \nrailways, and he passed away in April 2019. (Tr. 34.) He received a pension upon \nretirement, and Applicant\u2019s mother now receives the pension. (Tr.38.) \n\n \n \nApplicant has two brothers. One is a citizen and resident of India serving as a \ncolonel in the Indian Army as an infantry officer. This brother expects to retire from the \nIndian Army in April 2020, when he qualifies for his pension. Applicant talks to him by \ntelephone every other week. (Tr. 36-37.)  \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s other brother is a citizen of India working in the United States as a \nguest worker sponsored by a U.S. company. He has applied for a green card and intends \nto remain in the United States. (Tr. 31.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is not employed outside the home. She is married to a \npediatrician in private practice in India. (Tr. 26.) She and her husband have been \nsponsored for immigration to the United States by Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law. Applicant \ntalks to his sister by telephone weekly. (Tr. 32, 36-37.) \n \n \nApplicant owns two condominiums and a parcel of undeveloped land in India. (Tr. \n39.) They were purchased as investment properties. (Tr. 44.) He signed the purchase \ncontracts for the two condominiums in 2007, purchasing one for about $30,000 and the \nother for about $25,000. Both were under construction at the time. He completed the \npayments for both condominiums in October 2010, at which time he was given titles for \nthe property. The two condominiums are each rented for about $150 per month, which is \ndeposited directly into his mother\u2019s bank account. (Tr. 40-43.) In April 2015, he purchased \na tract of undeveloped land in India for about $43,000. He testified that his only sources \nof income for the past 11 years have been from the United States, except for the small \nrental income from his investment properties, which is paid directly to his mother. (Tr. 25.) \nApplicant and his siblings have an inheritance interest in their parents\u2019 home, which is \nworth about $100,000. (Tr. 44.) \n \n \nIn a post-hearing submission Applicant stated that he intends to sell the two \ncondominiums in India. The sales will require his presence in India, and he plans to travel \nto India in November or December 2019 to complete the sales. (AX U.) \n \n \nApplicant purchased his family home in the United States in December 2016 for \nabout $307,000. (AX H.) His balance on the mortgage loan is about $138,705. (AX I.) He \nalso owns two condominiums in the United States that are rental properties. He \npurchased them in 2015 for $115,000 and $55,000. (AX J; AX L.) His net rental income \nfrom the rental properties is about $800 per month. He also purchased a parcel of \nresidential land in the United States for about $3,000, as an investment. (AX K; AX P.) \nThere are no unpaid mortgage loans in these investment properties. (Tr. 45-46.) In \nSeptember 2017, he purchased seven parcels of undeveloped land in the United States \nfor $245,000, borrowing $196,000 to make the purchase. (AX O.) He has about $70,700 \nin retirement accounts. (AX Q; AX R; AX S.) He owns one car worth about $15,000 on \nwhich there is no loan. (AX T.) He estimates that he and his wife have about $100,000 in \ncash and other assets. (Tr. 47.)  \n \n\n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by his employer. He was promoted to \u201csystems \nengineer\u201d after 14 years of experience, instead of the 20 years of experience that is \nusually required. (Tr. 19.) His performance is evaluated on a four-point system: (1) below \nexpectations; (2) meets expectations; (3) exceeds expectations; and (4) far exceeds \nexpectations. His evaluations for 2016, 2017, and 2018 rated him as exceeding \nexpectations. (AX B; AX C; AX D.) He was the \u201cEmployee of the Quarter\u201d for the 4th \nquarter of 2016, and the \u201cRookie of the Year for 2016. (AX E; AX F.) \n4 \n \n \n \nThe Republic of India is a federal parliamentary republic. Its government consists \nof a president, prime minister, bicameral legislature, and a supreme court. Observers of \nrecent elections considered them fair and free despite isolated instances of violence. India \nand the United States share interests in global security, stability, and economic prosperity. \nThe United States supports India\u2019s emergence as a leading global power and a vital \npartner. In 2018, the United States and India affirmed India\u2019s designation as a major \ndefense partner of the United States and agreed to expand defense and security \ncooperation. Indian governmental agencies, private companies, and individuals are \nfrequently involved in the illegal transfer of sensitive data and dual-use equipment to \nIndia. Several anti-Western terrorist groups are active in India. India experiences terrorist \nattacks, including those by Pakistan-based terrorist organizations. Human-rights issues \ninclude widespread corruption; and lack of criminal investigations or accountability for \nrape, domestic violence, dowry-related deaths, and honor killings. A lack of accountability \nat all levels of government contributes to widespread impunity and discrimination based \non religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, and caste or tribe. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s father, mother, and sister are citizens and \nresidents of India (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c); that one of his two brothers is a citizen and resident \nof India currently serving in the Indian military (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that he owns two apartments \nin India worth about $130,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that he owns land in India worth about \n$43,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \n\n \n6 \n \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided). \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government.  \n \n \nWhen foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. \n01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). Applicant\u2019s family ties to his mother, sister, and \na brother who is a senior officer in the Indian Army; his substantial investments in real \nestate in India; India\u2019s involvement in economic espionage; widespread corruption in the \nIndian government; and the vulnerability of his family members to terrorist attacks are \nsufficient to establish the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) and the potential for a \nconflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant is close to his mother, sister, and brother. \nAlthough India is a friendly country, it is involved in economic espionage, has serious \nhuman-rights problems, and is vulnerable to terrorism. \n \n\n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant has lived and worked in the United States since \nFebruary 2008. He has been a U.S. citizen since June 2015. He is married to a U.S. \ncitizen and his child is a U.S. citizen. He has immersed himself in the history and culture \nof the United States, and he is deeply grateful for the lifestyle he and his family enjoy in \nthe United States. One of his brothers works in the United States and is seeking \npermanent U.S. residence. His sister and her husband have applied for immigration to \nthe United States. His other brother is a senior officer in the Indian Army, but he is a \ncombat soldier and is not involved in governmental policy-making, development of \nsophisticated technology, military intelligence, or industrial development. I am satisfied \nthat Applicant will resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant has not overcome the presumption that his \ncontacts with his immediate family members are not casual. See ISCR Case No. 00-0484 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) is established. The value of Applicant\u2019s investments in India is greatly \noutweighed by his assets in the United States. He has no emotional attachment to the \ninvestment properties, and he gives the small rental income from his Indian investments \nto his mother. He is in the process of divesting himself of his Indian investments.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, and \npersuasive at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by family ties and financial \ninvestments in India. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 50-year-old logistics auditor employed by a defense contractor since April 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1987 to June 2014 and retired as a chief petty officer. He was unemployed from June 2014 to April 2015.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 15, 2017. On \nMarch 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 12, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 1, 2019, and \nthe case was assigned to me on July 23, 2019. On August 7, 2019, the Defense Office of \n\n \n2 \n \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nAugust 28, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through N, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on September 9, 2019. \n \nJurisdiction \n \n \nAt the hearing Applicant testified that he had \u201cresigned\u201d from his job with a defense \ncontractor on June 22, 2019, because he could not enter his workplace without a \nclearance. He testified that his employer offered him another position, but he \u201cjust walked \naway\u201d and was unemployed. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that he had been offered another \njob, contingent on obtaining a security clearance. (Tr. 31.) The Directive \u00b6 4.4 states that \nthe adjudication process \u201cshall cease upon termination of the applicant\u2019s need for access \nto classified information,\u201d except in cases where the hearing has commenced, a \nclearance decision has been issued, or the applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended \nand the applicant provided a written request that the case continue. See ISCR Case No. \n05-04831 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006). \n \nApplicant\u2019s clearance was not suspended. It expired due to the lapse of more than \ntwo years after he retired from the Navy. See ISCR Case No. 15-02480 (A.J. Sep. 19, \n2016 at 7-8) (explaining differences between active, current, and expired security \nclearances). As of the date of the hearing, the Joint Personnel Adjudications System \n(JPAS) reflected that Applicant was being sponsored for a clearance by the contractor \nwho hired him in April 2019. On September 17, 2019, three weeks after the hearing, JPAS \nstill reflected that he was being sponsored by the same company. (Hearing Exhibit I.) \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s decision to \u201cresign,\u201d he remains on the employer\u2019s records, \napparently in an unpaid leave status, and his sponsor will reinstate him if he receives a \nsecurity clearance. He also has another employment offer contingent on obtaining a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that DOHA has jurisdiction to complete the adjudication of \nhis application for a security clearance. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, explaining that \nsome of the debts had been satisfied or were being satisfied. His admissions in his answer \nand at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old logistics auditor employed by a defense contractor since \nApril 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1987 to June 2014 \nand retired as a chief petty officer. He was unemployed from June 2014 to April 2015. He \nworked for a ride-sharing company from April 2015 until he was hired by his current \nemployer. (GX 2 at 3.) He held a security clearance while he was on active duty in the \nNavy. (Tr. 27.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant married in March 1992 and he has two children. He obtained an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2010, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011, and a master\u2019s degree in 2012. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 32 delinquent debts totaling about $80,000. The debts are \nreflected in three credit reports and court records reflecting judgments entered against \nApplicant. (GX 3-6.) Applicant disclosed three delinquent debts, including the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.l, when he submitted his SCA, and he declared his intention to \u201cschedule new \nmonthly payments on all [his] credit cards to have them all paid off in 2018.\u201d (GX 1 at 30-\n34.) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2018, he was confronted \nwith numerous delinquent debts. He claimed to be resolving several of them but provided \nno documentation of his claims. (GX 2 at 5-9.) The evidence concerning the debts and \njudgments alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: debt to electronics and appliance store referred for collection of \n$5,449. In November 2017, a judgment was entered against Applicant for this debt. (GX \n6 at 4.) In his SOR answer, he promised to pay this debt by December 2019. It is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card debt for $568. Applicant settled this debt in August 2019 \n(AX F.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: home-improvement debt referred for collection of $3,438. A default \njudgment was entered against Applicant for this debt in January 2019. (GX 6 at 1.) In his \nSOR answer, he promised to pay this debt by November 2019. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card debt for $1,525. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he promised \nto pay this debt by September 2019. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f: medical debts for $143 and $123. In Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer, he stated that these debts were paid in March 2019. He submitted no \ndocumentation of payment. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: department store debt for $1,414. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he \npromised to pay this debt by December 2019. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j: collection accounts for $1,197; $161; and $317. \nApplicant paid these debts in August 2019. (AX C, D, and E.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n: debts to the same bank for $1,240; $7,536; and \n$1,045. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he promised to resolve these debts in September \n2019, December 2019, and March 2020. He submitted evidence that he made payments \non two other debts to this creditor in November 2018 and August 2019. (AX L and M.) \nHowever, he submitted no evidence of payments or payment agreements for the debts \nalleged in the SOR, which are not resolved.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: debt to furniture store for $4,088. This debt was reduced to judgment \nin March 2017. (GX 6 at 5.) Applicant paid it in July 2019. (AX A; Tr. 33-34.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: credit-card debt for $2,259. In December 2017, a default judgment \nwas entered against Applicant for this debt. (GX 6 at 2.) In his SOR answer, he promised \nto pay this debt by September 2019. He made a payment agreement on August 22, 2019 \n(six days before the hearing) and promised to make payments in August, September, and \nOctober 2019. He submitted no evidence of payments. The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: debt to credit union for $4,126. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he stated \nthat he had a payment agreement for monthly $84 payments. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence of payments or a payment agreement. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q and 1.ff: debt to credit union for about $12,000. In Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer and at the hearing, he stated that these debts were duplicates and that he was \npaying $162 per month. He submitted no documentation of payments or a payment \nagreement. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r: debt to credit union for $6,093. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he stated \nthat he settled this debt for $2,498 and was paying $150 per month. He submitted no \ndocumentary evidence of payments or a payment agreement. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.s: charge-account debt for $3,331. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he \npromised to pay this debt by December 2019. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.t: department-store debt referred for collection of $1,224. Applicant \nsettled this debt in February 2019. (AX H.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.w-1.y, 1.aa, and 1.cc: credit-card accounts issued by the same \nbank for $3,483; $1,394; $3,333; $3,345; $795; and $1,048. Applicant paid these debts \nin June 2019. (AX N.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v and 1.z: credit-card accounts issued by the same bank delinquent \nfor $2,234 and $3,052. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he promised to resolve these debts \nby May 2019. They are not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.bb: office-supply store debt for $179. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he \npromised to resolve this debt by May 2019. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.dd: charge-account debt for $512. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he \npromised to resolve this debt by December 2019. It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.ee: past-due payments on time share for $1,080. In Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer, he stated that he was \u201cworking on settlement amount.\u201d He submitted no evidence \nof negotiations, payments, or a payment agreement. It is not resolved. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He purchased a luxury sports car for \n$68,000 in 2012. He purchased the time share alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee in 2014 and has \nnever used it. He incurred federal and state tax debts for 2015 and 2016 by making early \nwithdrawals from his 401k account for \u201cstuff around the house.\u201d His federal tax debt was \nabout $8,000 and his state tax debt was about $2000. He resolved the tax debts through \npayment agreements. (GX 2 at 9.)  \n \nApplicant has not sought or received financial counseling. He declined an offer \nfrom his employer to reassign him to a job not requiring a security clearance. However, \nhe has made some progress in righting his financial ship. He paid off the mortgage loan \non his home in June 2018, making more funds available to pay off his debts. (Tr. 55.) In \nJanuary 2019, he resolved several debts, not alleged in the SOR, to two insurance \ncompanies, a discount department store, an electronics store, and a bank. (AX G and I \nthrough M.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, recent, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment after his retirement \nfrom the Navy and his underemployment from April 2015 to April 2017 were conditions \nbeyond his control. However, he has not acted responsibly. He disclosed several \ndelinquent debts in his SCA, attributed them to unemployment, and indicated that he was \nin the process of resolving them. He was confronted with his delinquent debts when he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in April 2018, but his first significant action to \nresolve his debts was in June 2018, ten months after he found employment, when he paid \noff his mortgage loan. Six months elapsed before his next significant step, when he paid \noff several delinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant declined an offer of reassignment from his current employer in June \n2019, choosing unemployment over a less desirable job. He has not sought or received \nfinancial counseling. Most of his activity to resolve his debts occurred after he received \nthe SOR. \u201cA person who begins to address concerns only after having been placed on \nnotice that his or her access is in jeopardy may lack the willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 15-03696 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019, citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h-1.j, 1.l, 1.t, 1.u, \n1.w-1.y, 1.aa, and 1.cc, which have been resolved. Although Applicant claimed he was \nmaking payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.r, and 1.ff and had paid the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established because he submitted no \n\n \n8 \n \ndocumentary evidence to support his claim. When an applicant claims to have resolved \ncertain debts, he or she is expected to present documentary evidence supporting those \nclaims. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.s, and 1.dd, \nwhich Applicant promised to pay by a future date. A promise to pay a delinquent debt in \nthe future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR \nCase No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s long and \nhonorable service in the U.S. Navy, during which time he held a security clearance without \nincident. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.g, 1.k, 1.m-1.s, 1.v, 1.z,\n1.bb, and 1.dd-1.ff:   \n \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs. 1.b, 1.h-1.j, 1.l, 1.t, 1.u, 1.w-1.y, \n1.aa, and 1.cc:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant is 53 years old and widowed. She has a 29-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. She has a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. (Tr. 24-26) Applicant worked for federal contractors from 2005 until 2013. She was then unemployed until 2016, when she obtained a position with another federal contractor. She worked for that contractor until May 2018 when her contract ended. She is unemployed now and attending technical school to obtain certifications she needs to qualify for a federal contract with the employer for whom she recently worked and is sponsoring her for a security clearance. She did volunteer work and odd jobs during the times she was unemployed. From December 2018 until February 2019, she had a temporary position. She is receiving unemployment benefits and periodic financial assistance through friends. (Tr. 27-37, 64, 74) Applicant held security clearances while employed with some federal contractors.

National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 12, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on March 27, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On July 8, 2019, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On July 10, 2019, DOHA \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nissued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for August 13, 2019. The case was heard as \nscheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into \nevidence. They were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, but did not offer any \nexhibits. The record remained open until August 30, 2019, to give Applicant an \nopportunity to submit evidence. She timely submitted four group exhibits that I marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 4. Department Counsel had no objection to these \ndocuments, and they are admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August \n30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except SOR \u00b6 \n1.h, which she denied. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings.  \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and widowed. She has a 29-year-old daughter from a \nprevious relationship. She has a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. (Tr. 24-26) Applicant \nworked for federal contractors from 2005 until 2013. She was then unemployed until 2016, \nwhen she obtained a position with another federal contractor. She worked for that \ncontractor until May 2018 when her contract ended. She is unemployed now and \nattending technical school to obtain certifications she needs to qualify for a federal \ncontract with the employer for whom she recently worked and is sponsoring her for a \nsecurity clearance. She did volunteer work and odd jobs during the times she was \nunemployed. From December 2018 until February 2019, she had a temporary position. \nShe is receiving unemployment benefits and periodic financial assistance through friends. \n(Tr. 27-37, 64, 74)  \n \n \nApplicant held security clearances while employed with some federal contractors. \nShe thinks she obtained her first clearance in 1991 or 1992. (Tr. 69) She has gone through \nthe security clearance investigation process several times. (Tr. 70) \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to the following factors: financial \nmismanagement for many years; caring for her ill mother for five years until she died in \n2009; and long periods of unemployment. (Tr. 31-33) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from January 2019 and February 2018, the \nSOR alleged two income tax issues from 2011 and 2012, and seven debts that became \ndelinquent between 2013 and 2017 and total $9,877. The status of each tax issue or debt \nis as follows: \n \n  \n \n(1.a) Applicant has not filed Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. She \nsaid she had been unable to obtain the necessary documents that were in a storage unit \nshe lost because she was unable to pay storage fees in 2013. She said she was working \non the issue with an accountant. She submitted a document from the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS), dated July 19, 2018, which lists information about her wages and income \nfor 2011. (Tr. 38-39; Answer; AE 4) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n(1.b) Applicant has not filed state income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. She said \nshe has been unable to obtain the necessary documents that were in a storage unit she \nlost because she was unable to pay storage fees in 2013. She said she was working on \nthe issue with an accountant. She thinks she may owe her state about $400 for 2011 and \n2012. (Tr. 39-40, 43-44; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n \n(1.c through 1.i) None of these alleged debts are resolved, including six that are \nless than $720. (Tr. 52, 79; Answer)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that she filed her 2018 Federal income tax returns and was \nscheduled to receive a refund for that year from the IRS and state. She said she filed her \n2016 and 2017 tax returns on time. She received a refund for 2017 from the IRS and \nstate. She stated she did not file returns for 2013, 2014 and 2015 because she was not \nworking those years and did not have enough income. (Tr. 42-46; AE 4)  \n \n \nApplicant owes approximately $80,000 in student loans. She said the loans were \nin deferred status for the past couple years up to August 1, 2019. She said she was paying \nthem while she was employed. She stated they are now in forbearance until November \n2019. (Tr. 47-49; AE 3)  \n \n \nApplicant enrolled in a debt-consolidation plan in August 2016. At that time, her \nunpaid debts totaled $87,868; and included $75,646 in student loans, and the debts \nalleged in the SOR. She made a few monthly payments of $330 in 2016 on the plan, and \nthen stopped in 2017 because she was not working. She resumed in January 2018 and \nmade payments until July 2018, when she no longer had enough money. She has not \nmade payments since then. (Tr. 50-52; AE 2) She participated in credit counseling when \nenrolled in the debt-consolidation plan. (Tr. 78) \n \n \nApplicant has not received a paycheck since February 2019. One month ago, she \nstarted receiving $358 a week in unemployment, and is entitled to receive a total of \n$10,000. (Tr. 72) She did not submit a written budget. She said she pays $470 for rent, \n$200 for a car loan, $250 for car insurance, and $80 for a cell phone each month. She \nalso pays for gas, food, and medical insurance. (Tr. 55-61) In January 2019, a friend \npurchased a $35,000 to $40,000 car for her, of which she is responsible for about $7,000 \n($200 a month). (Tr. 54-55, 73) This is the second time she has received unemployment \nbenefits. (Tr. 75)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of inability to satisfy debts that began in 2013 and continues \nto the present. She failed to file Federal and state income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out conditions that could potentially mitigate those \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been ongoing for five or more years and her \nunfiled tax returns for 2011 and 2012 have been delinquent for about seven years. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. Applicant has encountered periods of unemployment, which may \nhave been circumstances beyond her control. However, she also admitted that she has \npoorly managed her finances, which was a circumstance within her control. She \nattempted to resolve delinquent debts beginning in 2016 through a debt-consolidation \nplan, but was unable to make the payments after a period of time due to the loss of her \njob in July 2018. She contacted the IRS and an accountant about her unfiled 2011 and \n2012 Federal and state income tax returns in July 2018, but they remain unfiled. The \nevidence establishes some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nApplicant received credit or financial counseling from a debt-consolidation \ncompany in 2016. However, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that her unfiled \nincome tax returns or delinquent debts are under control. The evidence does not establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). In 2016, she initiated a good-faith effort to resolve delinquent \ndebts through monthly payments, but was unable to maintain those payments after she \nbecame unemployed. She established some mitigation as to her delinquent consumer \ndebts under AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant\u2019s Federal and state income tax returns for 2011 and \n2012 are not filed despite the fact that she has had ample time to do so. The evidence \ndoes not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent and educated woman, who has worked for federal \ncontractors and held security clearances over the years. She is familiar with the security \ninvestigative process, including its inquiry into one\u2019s financial problems, having gone \nthrough it periodically. While she candidly admitted that she has unfiled tax returns for \n2011 and 2012, waiting more than six years to file income tax returns raises questions \nabout her judgment. She also failed to demonstrate that she has taken sufficient steps to \ncontact creditors and work out a resolution for her delinquent debts when she became \nunable to pay them. She has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. The record evidence leaves me with doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \nreliability and suitability for a security clearance at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n        Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \n \n        Against Applicant \n \n \n         \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant has significant debts and multiple bankruptcy filings. Based \nupon the record as a whole, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960); DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), \nas amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), \nfor all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 10, 2019, admitting eight of the 21 SOR \nallegations, admitting in part and denying in part seven allegations, and denying the \nremaining six allegations. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge of the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On June 18, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 21, 2019, scheduling the \nhearing on July 24, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered seven \ndocuments, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. Applicant offered \nfive documents, which I marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E. I kept the record \nopen until August 7, 2019, to give Applicant the opportunity to submit additional exhibits. \nOn August 6-7, 2019, he emailed five additional exhibits, which I have marked as AE F \nthrough J. All exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. DOHA received \nthe transcript on August 5, 2019 (Tr.). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response in the findings of \nfact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 1, his security clearance \napplication, dated September 9, 2017, (SCA) unless otherwise indicated by a \nparenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 49, works for a U.S. Government contractor as a program management \nprinciple. He has been employed by his security clearance sponsor since 2008, when he \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He also entered into a master\u2019s program in 2011 and earned \nhis degree in 2015. He has held a security clearance since 2008. The DOD CAF\u2019s action \nwas based upon Applicant\u2019s financial problems arising out of his divorce and related child-\ncustody issues.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in 2004. He and his wife have two children, and she has a \nchild from a prior relationship. Applicant\u2019s wife filed for divorce in 2011. The divorce was \nfinalized in 2013. After the divorce, Applicant fathered a child with another woman. \n \n \nApplicant had joint custody of their children with his ex-wife until 2016. He filed for \nfull custody of the children due to the behavior of his ex-wife. This began a lengthy court \nbattle that Applicant eventually lost. In December 2016, his ex-wife was awarded sole \nlegal custody of their two children and his rights were limited to visitation every other \nweekend. His child support payments increased from $300 to $2,200 per month, which \ncaused him financial hardship. He also incurred significant legal expenses and other costs \nrelated to the custody dispute. After he lost his joint custodial rights, he was ordered by \nthe court to pay his wife\u2019s legal expenses. The dispute with his ex-wife is ongoing three \nyears later.  \n \n \nOn four or more occasions, the civil divorce court found Applicant to be in contempt \nof its orders. The court also ordered Applicant to be jailed for two days for contempt. The \n\n3 \n \norder regarding contempt states that this penalty was imposed due to Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission of false income information and documentation, but Applicant insists he was \nonly jailed because he could not afford to pay the court-ordered legal fees. (Tr. 27-29, 39-\n40, 42, 44, 46, 81-82.; GE 5 at 1, 12; AE B at 32, 34-44, 45, 48-51, 54) \n \n \nApplicant borrowed significant amounts of money to pay the expenses of his \nunsuccessful attempt to gain full custody of his children, even though he was making \nabout $120,000 per year, and with a second job in 2017, he made an additional $40,000 \nin that year. This custody dispute occurred while he was also paying for graduate school \nwith borrowed funds. At the same time that he was incurring these new debts, he also \nretained his home on which he had a mortgage in excess of $400,000. He testified that \nhe did not want to sell his home because he wanted it for his children. He defaulted on \nboth the first and second mortgages, and the lender sued for foreclosure. He also \ndefaulted on a number of loans that he used to finance his expenses related to his custody \ndispute. In May 2019, Applicant sold his house and paid off his first mortgage and a \nsecond mortgage of about $40,000 with the sales proceeds. (Tr. 25, 38-39; GE 7 at 3; \nGE 4; AE C at 9-10.) \n \n \nApplicant tried to work with a debt-consolidation company in 2015 and 2016. At \nthat time, he stopped paying his bills, assuming they would be paid by the debt \nconsolidator. The company negotiated a settlement of one of his debts, but Applicant \nlearned that the company was paying itself substantial fees leaving insufficient monies to \nfund the settlement. He ceased paying the company in 2016. After being ordered to pay \nhis wife\u2019s legal fees in late 2017, he opted for what he referred to at the hearing as a new \n\u201cmitigation strategy.\u201d In January 2018, he filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 13 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), but two of his creditors, his ex-wife and her attorney objected. For reasons \nthat Applicant could not clearly explain, that stopped the proceeding, and it was \nadministratively dismissed when he did not pursue the case. (Tr. 28-35, 57; AE G; AE H.) \n \n \nIn July 2018, Applicant refiled under Chapter 13 with the same result. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nHe submitted after the hearing evidence that he had filed a new bankruptcy petition on \nAugust 7, 2019, this time under Chapter 7 seeking a full discharge of his debts. He \ntestified at the hearing that he was contemplating taking this step, but he could not explain \nwhy such a petition would not face the same obstacles that halted his prior two petitions. \nHe also testified that in filing for bankruptcy relief, he was not intending to alter his court-\nordered obligations to pay his ex-wife and her attorney, but he could not explain why they \nsought to prevent him from pursuing his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 28-30, 32-33, 36, 41-43; \nAE F.) \n \n \nThe 19 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR total more than $700,000, the largest \nof which was his mortgage and second mortgage. Applicant submitted no documentary \nevidence listing the debts covered by his latest bankruptcy petition. (SOR response; AE \nF.) \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted the following six delinquent debts, which \ntotal about $100,000: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Debt owed to lender placed for collection in the amount of \n$13,509. Applicant borrowed $15,000 from this lender in January 2016 to pay his bills \nduring the period of his financial distress caused by his 2013 divorce and subsequent \nchild-custody dispute. He defaulted on the loan in about January 2017 due to the ongoing \ncosts associated with his lengthy divorce proceeding. Aside from his attempts to seek \nrelief from this debt under Chapter 13, he has done nothing to pay the debt. The same is \ntrue with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, discussed below. (GE 2 at \n8-9; Tr. 49-51.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Debt owed to a lender charged off in the amount of $32,143. \nApplicant borrowed $35,000 from this lender in February 2015 to pay his bills during a \nperiod of financial distress caused by his divorce. He defaulted on the loan in about June \n2016. He has not resolved this debt, but following discussions with the creditor, he has \nlearned that he must initially pay $115 per month for a period to qualify for a settlement \nto resolve the debt. He has not made any payments. (Tr. 50; GE 2 at 6; AE I.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Debt owed to a lender charged off in the amount of $27,105. \nApplicant borrowed $30,000 from this lender in July 2015 and defaulted in May 2016. (Tr. \n50; GE 2 at 6-7; AE J.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: Debt owed to computer manufacturer placed for collection in the \namount of $1,443. Applicant purchased computer equipment on credit in 2015 and \ndefaulted in July 2016. (Tr. 56-57; GE 2 at 9; GE 7 at 4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: Debt owed to a lender placed for collection in the amount of \n$15,473. Applicant did not disclose this debt in his SCA, and it was not discussed in his \nFebruary 2018 background interview. He listed the debt in his July 2018 Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition. He testified that this debt is one of his student loans, which he paid \nfor a period and then stopped paying. (Tr. 59-62; SOR response; GE 4 at 37.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: Debt owed to a credit union on a credit-card account in the \namount of $25,886. Applicant did not disclose this debt in his SCA, and it was not \ndiscussed in his February 2018 background interview. He listed the debt in his July 2018 \nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition. He testified that he has contacted the credit union but \nhas not agreed to a payment plan nor has he made any payments. (Tr. 62-64; SOR \nresponse; GE 4 at 37.) \n \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted five debts and one other allegation \u201cin \npart.\u201d These matters are: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h: Two credit-card accounts placed for collection in the \namounts of $20,945 and $11,072, respectively. In both cases, the credit-card issuers \nsued Applicant and obtained judgments, which were enforced for a period by way of \n\n5 \n \ngarnishment. Applicant testified that the garnishments ceased at some point, though he \nacknowledged that much of the debts remain unpaid. He could not explain why the \ngarnishments ceased, but it is likely the result of Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filings. These \ndebts remain unpaid, though the amounts due may have been somewhat reduced unless \ninterest and collection expenses actually increased the amounts of the debts. (Tr. 51-52.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p: First and second mortgage accounts listed in \nApplicant\u2019s July 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. Applicant and his ex-wife \nbought a residence in April 2009. In connection with his separation and divorce, he \nrefinanced the mortgage loan in the amount of $407,500. He also borrowed or had a line \nof credit in the amount of $50,000 from the same lender that was secured by a second \nmortgage. He defaulted on both loans in late 2017. The lender instituted mortgage \nforeclosure proceedings. He hoped that his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings in 2018 would \nhalt the foreclosure on his home or give him the opportunity to renegotiate the repayment \nterms of the loans. Before the foreclosure was completed, Applicant sold the home in May \n2019, and the proceeds were sufficient to satisfy both loans. Applicant introduced a \ndocument from the lender evidencing that the first mortgage was paid in full. He also \nprovided a current credit report that reflected that the second mortgage was also satisfied. \n(Tr. 65-68, 93; AE D at 1, 3, 17-19; GE 2 at 10.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q: Debt owed to Applicant\u2019s ex-wife in the amount of $19,762. In his \nSOR response, Applicant admitted that he owes this debt, which is for his ex-wife\u2019s legal \nfees, plus interest on the debt. The civil court had ordered that the debt be paid through \na wage garnishment in monthly installments of $1,000. This payment is in addition to the \nwage garnishment for his ongoing child support payments, plus $500 per month for \nsanctions. He testified that the debt was not actually for a delinquency. The debt \nrepresents monies accruing during the interval between when his ex-wife requested \nincreased child support payments and when the court actually awarded her the increase. \nApplicant claims this debt is now about $16,000, plus interest, but he failed to provide any \ndocumentation reflecting the remaining balance. (Tr. 44-45, 47-48, 68-69; AE B at 45-47, \n53-54.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.u: Court ruling holding Applicant in contempt for failure to make \nrequired payments and ordering him to serve two days in jail with a 60-day \nsuspended sentence. Following hearings in February and April 2018, the civil court \nfound that Applicant had failed to make required payments and had been deceptive in his \ndiscovery responses and testimony and had \u201cfabricated tax returns.\u201d Applicant conceded \nat the hearing that he was found in contempt and ordered to be jailed for two days in \n2018, but he insisted that the contempt was solely due to his inability to pay the legal fees \nof his ex-wife, as required by the court\u2019s order. In making this argument, he admitted that \nhe had failed to make the required payments. (Tr. 76-84; GE 5; AE B.) \n \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant denied the following six remaining debts:  \n \n \nApplicant claimed to have paid only one of these debts, and the amount of the debt \nwas $133. (SOR \u00b6 1.n.) He provided no documentary evidence of the payment. He \n\n6 \n \nasserted that he paid off a car loan with a voluntary repossession, again without any \ndocumentary evidence that there was no deficiency debt claimed by the lender. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.t.) He claimed that a loan was repaid as part of his debt-consolidation effort, though he \ntestified that this debt was not resolved because the consolidation company paid itself a \nfee and the lender would not accept the reduced amount of the previously negotiated \nsettlement amount. (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) In his SOR response, he denied the three other debts \nclaiming he was unaware of them and had never heard of the alleged creditor. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.k, 1.r, 1.s.) In his background interview, he admitted that he was aware of the unpaid \nmedical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. He also admitted at the hearing that he had made no \ninquiry into the two largest alleged debts for $29,142 (SOR \u00b6 1.r) and $32,143 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.s) and creditors, although they were listed in his July 2018 bankruptcy petition. He \nbelieves they may be duplicates of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and \u00b6 1.e, respectively, \nbut he cannot say for sure since he has not investigated either debt. (Tr. 37, 52-54, 59, \n64, 70-72, 74-76; GE 2 at 7; GE 4 at 33, 39.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he received financial counseling from the debt-consolidation \ncompany, but it is unclear from the record whether the counseling was from a reliable and \nqualified source. He also provided evidence of having completed the bankruptcy \nrequirement of counseling as part of one of his Chapter 13 petitions. He may have also \nreceived counseling from his bankruptcy attorney, but there was no evidence as to what \nthe attorney may have advised, and the results of the two petitions filed in 2018 raise \nquestions about the advice and whether Applicant followed it. (Tr. 85-86; AE E.) \n \n \nThe contempt citations issued by the civil divorce court are relevant to the issue of \ncharacter. Applicant insists, however, that that his problems with the court were limited to \nhis inability to pay everything he was required to pay in a timely manner.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n8 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response and testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d).   \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debts which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) have not been \nestablished. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and frequent, making them likely to \nrecur and casting doubts about his judgment and reliability. His divorce and perhaps his \nchild-custody dispute can be considered as beyond his control, but there is little evidence \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances. His mitigation strategies were \nunsuccessful, starting with a failed attempt to consolidate debts that were simply too large \n\n9 \n \nto be repaid in a reasonable period of time and then followed by two bankruptcy filings in \na short time with no clear explanation as to why he did not complete the proceedings. \nThere is no reason to believe that his third bankruptcy filing, this time under Chapter 7, is \nany more likely to be successful than the prior two. He did sell his residence and pay off \nhis two largest debts, but the size and number of the remaining debts are significant. \n \nApplicant claims that he received financial counseling from the debt-consolidation \ncompany, but there is no evidence in the record that the source of the counseling was \nlegitimate and credible or that the counseling contributed in any significant way to a \nresolution of Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Applicant was required to take counseling \ncourses with his bankruptcy filings. Significantly, there is no clear indication that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) has \nbeen partially established. \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR, with the exception of \nhis mortgage loans following the sale of his home, which was the subject of a pending \nforeclosure. A Chapter 7 discharge of his debts in bankruptcy cannot be considered a \ngood-faith effort to resolve his debts. With the exception of the two mortgage loans, AG \u00b6 \n20(d) has not been established.  \n \nEven the debts Applicant disputed were not legitimately disputed or documented \nand in two cases, were not even investigated as to whether they were legitimate or just \nduplicates of other debts alleged in the SOR. One of those debts, however, (SOR \u00b6 1.s) \nis for the exact same amount as SOR \u00b6 1.e, which he admitted in his SOR response. It is \nreasonable to assume that SOR \u00b6 1.s alleges a duplicate debt. With that exception, AG \n\u00b6 20(e) has not been established with respect to the SOR allegations Applicant has \ndenied. \n \nApplicant\u2019s case for mitigation is simply that he got into legal difficulties with his \nchild-custody dispute, and he could not afford to remedy his problem. In the absence of \nsatisfactory evidence that he exercised sound judgment in addressing his personal legal \nproblem and then his resulting financial problems, he has not mitigated the security issues \nabout his trustworthiness and reliability. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n10 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nMy analysis of the Guideline F mitigating conditions addresses many of the above \nfactors. I have considered the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s financial situation and the fact \nthat many of his debts arose out of his efforts to do what he thought was best for his \nchildren. A mature, responsible individual, however, must also act in accordance with his \nfinancial capabilities. It is apparent from the divorce court orders in the record that \nApplicant had significant problems complying with the orders, particularly with respect to \npayments to his ex-wife and her attorney. Even more concerning is that his substantial \nindebtedness to a number of other creditors supports a conclusion that his financial \nproblems will continue for the foreseeable future. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o - 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q - 1.t: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR identifies three delinquent debt allegations under the financial considerations guideline. The delinquent debts total approximately $28,103. Applicant admitted the first allegation (SOR 1.a, delinquent car debt). He denied the second allegation (SOR 1.b, personal loan) and the third allegation (1.c, child support arrears). He attached an undated statement containing explanations for the delinquent accounts. Concerning SOR 1.a, he provided documentation that the installment loan had been discharged in his former wife\u2019s bankruptcy. He provided proof that he paid the SOR 1.b debt in February 2018. According to his documentation dated June 2018, his child support arrears were eliminated after a negotiation conference with the child\u2019s mother. Applicant is 32 years old and is separated from his third wife. He has a seven- year-old son who lives with one of his former wives in state Y. He served in the U.S. Army from August 2008 until his honorable medical discharge in August 2014. Applicant has been living and working as a field service representative in state Y since September 2016.

His largest delinquent debt, for which he is jointly \nliable, is an installment account that became delinquent in September 2015. His \ncomplete payoff of the personal loan debt of $2,219 is insufficient to overcome the \nnegative evidence under the guideline for financial considerations. Eligibility for security \nclearance access is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 22, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (Item 4) to retain a security clearance required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. He provided a summary interview (PSI) (Item 5) to \nan investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on October 5, 2017. \nDOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 11, 2019, \ndetailing security reasons under the financial considerations guideline (Guideline F) for \ndenial of his security clearance application. The action was taken under Executive \n\n \n  2 \n \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs).  \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on March 4, 2019. He \nelected to have his case decided on a written record instead of a hearing. (Item 3) The \nGovernment sent a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), the Government\u2019s \nevidence in support of the allegations in the SOR, to Applicant on April 2, 2019. \nApplicant received the FORM on April 10, 2019. The Government advised Applicant \nthat he could either file objections, furnish explanations, submit additional material, or \ntake advantage of all three options within 30 days of receiving the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on May 10, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) received no response from Applicant. DOHA assigned the case file to me on \nJune 14, 2019. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \n \nIn a footnote at the bottom of the second page of the FORM, Department \nCounsel advised Applicant that the PSI (Item 5) would be excluded from evidence if he \nobjected to the exhibit. Alternatively, Department Counsel advised him that he could \ncorrect, update, or modify the exhibit to improve its clarity or accuracy. Applicant did not \nobject, and the exhibit was admitted into evidence. See, E3.1.20. of DOD Directive \n5220.6, page 52.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR identifies three delinquent debt allegations under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. The delinquent debts total approximately $28,103. Applicant \nadmitted the first allegation (SOR 1.a, delinquent car debt). He denied the second \nallegation (SOR 1.b, personal loan) and the third allegation (1.c, child support arrears). \nHe attached an undated statement containing explanations for the delinquent accounts. \nConcerning SOR 1.a, he provided documentation that the installment loan had been \ndischarged in his former wife\u2019s bankruptcy. He provided proof that he paid the SOR 1.b \ndebt in February 2018. According to his documentation dated June 2018, his child \nsupport arrears were eliminated after a negotiation conference with the child\u2019s mother.   \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and is separated from his third wife. He has a seven-\nyear-old son who lives with one of his former wives in state Y. He served in the U.S. \nArmy from August 2008 until his honorable medical discharge in August 2014. Applicant \nhas been living and working as a field service representative in state Y since September \n2016. In February 2019, he was living and working in state Y when he signed for \ndocumentation from DOD regarding his security clearance eligibility. From July 2015 to \n\n \n  3 \n \nSeptember 2016, Applicant was living and working as a mechanic in another country for \na company headquartered in state U. Applicant has never possessed a security \nclearance. (Item 1 at 7-23, 33; Item 5 at 4-7) \n \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Applicant and his former wife jointly signed an installment loan \ncontract to purchase a truck in November 2013. Both of their signatures on the \ninstallment loan meant that they were jointly liable for a failure to make regular \npayments on the loan. When his former wife announced that she did not want the truck \nanymore, Applicant called the dealer to have the truck repossessed. The last monthly \npayment made on the truck was in September 2015. The debt was charged off in \nDecember 2015. Applicant had made no attempt to pay off the debt, but intended to \nhandle the installment account in 2018. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed that he \nwas no longer liable for debt because it was discharged in his wife\u2019s Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Had he and his former wife filed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy jointly, or had he \nbeen removed from joint liability through a court action like a divorce decree, then he \nwould no longer be responsible for the debt. Applicant is still liable for the debt and the \ncreditor can pursue collection efforts against him as the joint account holder. (Item 5 at \n9-10, 14; Item 6 at 5: Item 7 at 1; answer to SOR, attached documentation) \n \n \nSOR 1.b. \u2013 Applicant opened an unsecured personal loan account in April 2013. \nHis last payment on the account was in October 2014, and the account was charged off \nin April 2015. Applicant provided documentation indicating that he satisfied the account \non February 27, 2018. (Answer to SOR, attached documentation) \n \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 The allegation reads that Applicant is indebted to the state of Y in the \namount of $6,054 for child support arrears. He explained that the arrears occurred when \nhe was unemployed in November 2016. His wages were garnished for payment. He \nsubmitted incomplete court documentation entitled \u201cChild Support Review Order.\u201d That \ndocumentation contains 17 pages, but Applicant only attached three pages with his \nanswer. The order indicates that on March 22, 2018 (time stamped on June 7, 2018) \nApplicant\u2019s arrears were eliminated after a negotiation conference. Missing from the \norder is information explaining the reason why the arrears were canceled. Except for \nApplicant\u2019s claims, there is no documented information of the current status of \nApplicant\u2019s child and medical support. (Item 5 at 12; answer to SOR, attached \ndocumentation) \n \n \nAlthough Applicant told the OPM investigator in October 2017 that he intended to \nenroll in a debt consolidation plan, but he provided no information that he pursued the \nplan. (Item 5 at 9) In addition, Applicant provided no information about whether he has \nhad any kind of financial counseling or has taken steps to improve his overall finances.  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, are applied together with common sense and the general \n\n \n  4 \n \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial \ndistress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nThe credit reports (Item 6, item 7) show that when the SOR was issued in \nFebruary 2019, Applicant owed $28,103. The accounts became delinquent between \nOctober 2014 and April 2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n  5 \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply as Applicant is still responsible for SOR 1.a debt. \nWhile his child support arrears were eliminated March 2018, he provided no reason for \nthe cancellation and no information explaining the current status of his child support \nobligations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides some mitigation for the child support arrears (SOR 1.c) \nbecause Applicant was unemployed for an unidentified period around November 2016. \nHowever, the record shows no unforeseen event in Applicant\u2019s life that was a primary or \ncontributing factor for the repossession of the SOR 1.a vehicle, or why he did not \nassume the payments based on his joint liability. He acted responsibly to pay off the \nSOR 1.b personal loan, but he provided no information about why he was excused from \npaying child support arrears. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply only in part. AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply because there is no evidence to infer that the arrearage was eliminated \nbecause it was disputed by Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines of financial \nconsiderations in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n  6 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and separated with a seven-year-old son. He received \nan honorable medical discharge from the U.S. Army in August 2014. He has worked at \nhis current job as a field service representative since November 2016. \n \n \nWeighing against the favorable evidence is Applicant\u2019s adverse security record \nshowing that he accumulated $28,103 in delinquent debt between October 2014 and \nApril 2017. To his credit, he satisfied the personal loan more than a year before the \nSOR was issued. But he has done nothing to resolve his joint liability for the installment \ncar loan. Though documentation shows that Applicant\u2019s child support arrearage was \nwithdrawn in March 2018, Applicant furnished no documented up-to-date information on \nhis child support. He decided not to respond to the FORM which he received on April \n10, 2019. Having weighed and balanced all the evidence under the specific conditions \nin light of the record as a whole, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n\n \n  7 \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n10/21/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \n \nDue to relocating for his employment, Applicant experienced a brief period of \nfinancial instability. However, he mitigated the financial concern by acting responsibly \nunder the circumstances and by reaching resolutions for all of the SOR debts. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on July 21, 2016. On \nFebruary 1, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 1, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 3, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me on April 11, 2019. On June 7, 2019, the Defense Office \n\n \n2\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nJune 27, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 6 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, and I \nadmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D. I left the record open until July 11, 2019, \nto enable Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E through \nAX G. On October 2, 2019, I reopened the record, without objection, and Applicant \nsubmitted AX H and AX I. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had four delinquent consumer accounts totaling \n$26,521. Applicant admits SOR \u00b6 1.b, a $3,062 credit-card debt, but denies the other \nthree allegations. The debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from \nMay 2019, December 2018, and October 2016. (GX 6; GX 5; GX 4.)  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old staff engineer currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since December 1999, and periodically employed by the same defense \ncontractor from 1989 until 1996. Applicant received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1988. He \nand his current wife married in 2012. He was previously married from 1991 until 2010. He \nhas three children and three step-children, none of whom reside with Applicant and his \nwife. He received his first security clearance in 1989. (GX 1; Tr. 38.)  \n \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s employer offered him a lateral transfer to a facility in another \nstate. Applicant thought the transfer would offer him greater opportunities within his \nemployment, as well as afford him a better cost-of-living. In March 2015, Applicant listed \nhis house for sale. He accepted the offer in April 2015 and moved to another state, where \nhe rented a house. Although his daughter resided in his house in his previous state of \nresidence, Applicant retained responsibility for paying the mortgage loan and the utilities \nwhile the house was on the market. The house sold in November 2015. (AX A; Tr. 20-\n22.) \n \nAfter relocating, Applicant was required to purchase household furnishings for his \nnew home. Due to the outlay of paying rent, furnishing his new home, and maintaining a \nmortgage and utilities on his previous home for a period of eight months, Applicant \namassed significant credit-card debt which became delinquent. Applicant purchased the \nhome he had been renting in November 2015 after the sale of his prior home. The assets \nfrom the sale were used for the purchase of the new home, and did not go toward reducing \nApplicant\u2019s credit-card debt. (Tr. 22-23.) Applicant has not had any delinquencies on \neither of his mortgage loans. (GX 4; GX 5.)  \n \nConcerned about his delinquent accounts, Applicant responded to an \nadvertisement for a debt-consolidation company (DCC) and entered an agreement with \nthe DCC in June 2016. The DCC instructed Applicant not to make any payments to or \nhave any contact with any of his creditors. Applicant was required to pay $600 into an \nescrow account at a specific bank which charged transactional fees. The DCC was \n\n \n3\nauthorized to withdraw Applicant\u2019s escrowed funds to cover fees and pay settlements on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. (Tr. 44-47.)  \n \nThe four SOR debts and one additional debt were the outstanding accounts that \nApplicant contracted with the DCC to resolve. The DCC settled the non-SOR debt. Based \non information that Applicant received from the DCC, he also thought that the DCC had \nsettled the $3,062 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1b in September 2017, and was \nworking to resolve the other three SOR debts. (AX G; Tr. 23-25.) The four SOR debts \nwent to collection between July and November 2016. (GX 5.)  \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant learned that despite his $600 monthly payments into \nthe escrow account, the DCC had resolved only the one non-SOR account, and his \nremaining balance in escrow was $300. Applicant terminated his relationship with the \nDCC and awaited contact by the remaining creditors. (AX A; Tr. 24-25.) Applicant accepts \nresponsibility for the debts that he incurred and states that it is his obligation to repay or \notherwise resolve these accounts. (Tr. 32-33.) \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant received an IRS Form 1099-C cancellation of debt for \nthe $4,821 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He properly filed the document and \nmade the appropriate adjustments when filing his 2018 tax return. (AX A.) This debt is \nresolved. \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant was contacted by the creditor of the $1,770 credit-card \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and offered a settlement agreement. Applicant settled this debt \nin full on March 31, 2019. (AX A.) Applicant was also contacted in March 2019 by the \ncreditor of the $3,062 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He entered a six-month \nsettlement agreement which was settled in full in September 2019. (AX A; AX B; Tr. 27.) \nThese two debts are resolved. \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant was served with a subpoena by the collection creditor \nfor the $16,868 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant retained an attorney who \nbegan settlement negotiations with the creditor. The parties signed a final stipulation for \nsettlement on October 2, 2019. Applicant agreed to pay $1,200 at $100 a month with the \nfinal payment being due on October 1, 2020. (AX I.) This debt is being resolved. \n \nApplicant\u2019s four coworkers, one of whom has also managed Applicant over the \npast four years, and another who was mentored by Applicant, who are aware of the SOR \nallegations, collectively highly recommend Applicant for security clearance stating that he \nis honest, trustworthy, and professional. (AX F.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit history dating back to 1989 shows consistent repayment of credit \ncards, vehicle loans, and mortgages. The only delinquent accounts are those that arose \nas a result of Applicant\u2019s relocation and the associated expenses. (AX 4; AX 6.) Applicant \nlives within his means, has not incurred any recent delinquent debts, and is able to \nmaintain his ongoing financial obligations. He maintains a budget on a spreadsheet, and \nhe and his wife sit down weekly to manage their accounts. (Tr. 35.) He has approximately \n\n \n4\n$9,000 in his combined checking and savings accounts and is entitled to a pension from \nhis employer. He has a monthly remainder of approximately $1,000. (Tr. 31.) Applicant \nwas candid, sincere, and credible during his testimony. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n\n \n5\n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n The record evidence establishes that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(c): a history \nof not meeting financial obligations applies. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n\n \n6\nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s past financial problems arose under unique circumstances that were \nlargely beyond his control. Specifically, Applicant incurred unanticipated expenses after \nrelocating for his employment due to being unable to sell his home for eight months. \nDuring that period, Applicant was responsible for the expenses of two households, one \nof which required new furnishings. Applicant overspent on his credit cards and the \naccounts became delinquent. Applicant acted responsibly by contracting with the DCC in \nan effort to repay or otherwise resolve the delinquent accounts. Upon learning that the \nDCC was not acting in good faith, Applicant terminated its services and waited for contact \nfrom his creditors. Immediately upon contact, Applicant fully settled one SOR debt and \nentered into a repayment agreement for another, which has since been fully resolved. He \nproperly filed and adjusted his tax returns to reflect the cancellation of another SOR debt. \nUpon receiving a subpoena from the remaining SOR creditor, Applicant hired an attorney \nwho successfully settled the account on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Applicant entered a settlement \nagreement for this account for $100 a month for one year, which is well within Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial capacity to repay.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \n \nApplicant has a strong credit history dating back to 1989, and this brief, past period \nof delinquencies is not reflective of Applicant\u2019s overall ability to effectively manage his \nfinances. Applicant accepts responsibility for his past financial difficulties and has reached \nresolution for all of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties did not arise under \ncircumstances that suggest reckless or irresponsible behavior. He lives within his means, \nand he and his wife maintain a budget. Applicant\u2019s past financial difficulties do not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He has made a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts and has established a plan to resolve the \nremaining SOR debt within his means. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, \nan administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by \n\n \n7\nconsidering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis and \nhave considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \ncircumstances. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on May 8, 2019. \n\n2 \nHe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 5. Applicant did not submit a timely response. \nThere were no objections filed by Applicant, and all Items are admitted into evidence. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 24, 2019.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 26 years old. He graduated from high school in 2011, and college in \n2017, with a bachelor\u2019s degree. He began working for a federal contactor in April 2017. \nHe has cohabitated since April 2017. (Item 3) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2017. In \nit he disclosed illegal drug use. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator \nin May 2018 and provided additional information about his illegal drug use. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant used marijuana from June 2011 to February 2017. He primarily used it in \nhis home, but also socially with college friends. It made him feel like he was having an \n\u201cout-of-body\u201d experience. He used it about 1,000 times. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant disclosed that he used Ecstasy from June 2012 to November 2015, on \nabout 19 occasions. He was introduced to it by a friend and felt peer pressure to try it. He \nagreed to do so. He did not consider it a bad experience and continued to use it quarterly \nat music festivals. Except for his first use, where his friend gave him the drug for free, he \nreimbursed the people who sold him the drug.1 (Items 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant used Psilocybin Mushrooms on about four occasions from November \n2011 to March 2015. Each use was at his apartment with a friend. It made him feel \nintrospective. He considered his use random and experimental. He never purchased it. \nHis friend would bring it to him. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant used LSD once in March 2013, with a friend. His friend supplied the drug. \nApplicant had minor hallucinations, and said his use was experimental. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant also disclosed that from December 2012 to December 2016, he \npurchased marijuana, usually from a friend, on a monthly basis. He noted that this was \nthe only way for him to obtain the drug. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant stated in his SCA, during his background interview, and in his answer to \nthe SOR that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He stated he no longer \n1 Applicant stated he would reimburse the person who provided Ecstasy to him. This is tantamount to \npurchasing it. I have not considered this conduct for disqualifying purposes, but may consider it when \nmaking a credibility determination, in applying mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhas contact with college peers with whom he used illegal drugs. He saw no value in \ncontinuing to use illegal drugs and does not want to risk losing his job or being arrested. \nHe stated he has never been dependent on any illegal drugs. He has never tested positive \nfor illegal drugs. He did not indicate how many drug tests he may have taken and if they \nwere randomly given. Applicant also stated that he has never felt addicted to any illegal \ndrug and has never received any form of counseling or treatment for using illegal drugs. \n(Items 3, 4, 5) \n \n \nIn his SCA, Applicant stated:  \n \nMarijuana was used voluntarily and with variable frequency over the time \nperiod listed above. At some periods, marijuana was frequently used, at \nother periods, only occasional use. Additionally there were many periods of \nabstinence (ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months) during the time frame listed \nabove. These periods of abstinence were all voluntary and for the purpose \nof not developing a habit of use (retaining control). At no point during the \ntime period listed, was any treatment advised or signs of addiction present. \nUse was for enjoyment with peers (similar to the widely accepted use of \nalcohol) and periods of abstinence were attained with ease. (Item 4) \n \nHe further stated in the SCA the following: \n \nIt should be noted that all of the above use was voluntary, purely for \npersonal enjoyment, and never once were any addictive or withdrawal signs \npresent. Use was never under persuasion or coercion. Motivation for use \nwas to increase quality of life by attaining differing perspectives. It has been \nstated, for each substance, the intent to permanently discontinue use. \nAdditionally, use was during very experimental period in life (college) and \nno such use has occurred since leaving that environment. Also that no \nproblems (financial, legal, mental, health, etc.) has ever occurred during any \nuse nor did use interfere with any aspects of life (school, job, social, etc.). \n(Item 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\n \n4 \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \n \n \n \nApplicant illegally used the following substances: marijuana about 1,000 times \nfrom June 2011 to about February 2017; Ecstasy from June 2011 to about November \n2015 about 19 times; hallucinogenic mushrooms about four times from November 2011 \nto March 2015; and LSD one time in March 2013. He purchased marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about December 2011 to about December 2016. The evidence \nestablishes the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \nApplicant was a regular drug abuser from 2011 to 2017. He honestly disclosed his \nillegal drug use in his SCA and background interview. He stated he would not use illegal \ndrugs in the future because he sees no value in continuing to use them and does not want \nto risk losing his job or being arrested. He said he last used illegal drugs in February 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use was ongoing from 2011 to 2017 and not infrequent. He was \naware that the repeated use of marijuana, Ecstasy, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and LSD \nover the course of at least six years was voluntarily illegal, and had the potential to \njeopardize his future. It appears that his knowledge of those consequences was not a \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndeterrent. He willingly made a choice to repeatedly break the law by buying and using \nillegal drugs. His use of illegal drugs was beyond youthful indiscretion and \nexperimentation. Based on Applicant\u2019s past history of marijuana and other illegal drug \nuse, and without corroborating evidence from a duly qualified medical professional and a \nfavorable diagnosis, as further discussed below, I find that future use is likely to recur. His \nconduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \nApplicant acknowledged his illegal drug use. He stated that he no longer uses \nillegal drugs; has disassociated himself from drug using associates and contacts; has \nchanged his environment; and provided a statement of intent to abstain all drug \ninvolvement. Although he asserts the above, he failed to provide corroborating evidence \nof actions he has taken to overcome his drug involvement. He stated he has not used \nillegal drugs since 2017. He stated he has not failed a drug test, but did not provide \nevidence that he participated in random drug testing, or if he did, he did not provide the \nresults. He stated he has moved and does not associate with his friends from college who \nuse drugs. He failed to provide evidence about whether he has returned to where he \nformerly lived or plans to visit in the future; whether any of his college friends have visited \nhim; whether any of his new friends use illegal drugs; whether he used illegal drugs in the \npast with the person with whom he cohabites; whether the person he cohabitates with \nuses illegal drugs; whether he was required to take a drug test prior to employment and \nthe results; and whether his employer has a drug testing program and how many tests he \nmay have participated in and the results. There is insufficient evidence for the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 26(b). \n \nApplicant stated in his SCA and answer to the SOR that \u201cat no point during the \ntime period listed, was any treatment advised or signs of addiction present.\u201d He further \nstated: \u201cAlso that no problems (financial, legal, mental, health, etc.) has ever occurred \nduring any use nor did use interfere with any aspects of life (school, job, social, etc.).\u201d \nApplicant failed to provide corroborating evidence as to who specifically evaluated and \nconcluded that he did not need treatment and had no signs of addiction, or that his \nconsistent and extensive drug use did not interfere with any aspects of his life. He did not \nprovide evidence that he was ever evaluated by a duly qualified medical professional. He \ndid not provide evidence that he has participated in a drug treatment program. AG \u00b6 26(d) \ndoes not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 26 years old. He has an extensive history of using illegal drugs from \n2011 to 2017. He admitted to using marijuana approximately 1,000 times and Ecstasy 19 \ntimes. He illegally purchased marijuana and Ecstasy. Applicant stated that he has \nabstained from illegal drug use since February 2017 and does not intend to use them in \nthe future. Other than his personal assertions, he did not provide corroborating evidence \nto support his claim that he does not have a drug problem. Applicant has not met his \nburden of persuasion. His six-year use and misuse of illegal substances reflects a long \npattern of failing to comply with rules and regulations.  The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file his 2011-2017 federal and state taxes as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). I have incorporated his admissions in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 1, his security clearance application (SCA), dated February 9, 2018, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant, 64, works as a senior engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked continuously since at least 1995, with two periods of unemployment, one in 2015 and a second shorter period in 2017. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1978. From 1979 to 1994, he held a secret clearance while working for a defense contractor. He has applied for a clearance in connection with his current position, which he has held since October 2017. He is married and has two adult children. In his February 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had not filed his federal and state income tax returns since 2010. He wrote that he believed that he has adequate withholding to pay his tax liabilities and was \u201cin the process of gathering the required information to file the appropriate tax forms and seeking the services of a tax service/accountant to help catchup.\u201d He blamed his delay on missing paperwork.

Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax returns from 2011 to 2017 \nas required. Based upon the record as a whole, his evidence was insufficient to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his extensive tax filing delinquencies. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 2, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) setting forth two allegations \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nOn April 24, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting both allegations in \nthe SOR and providing additional comments regarding mitigating circumstances. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On July 17, 2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on September 6, 2019, scheduling the hearing on September 25, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented three \nproposed exhibits, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant \noffered three proposed exhibits, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nC. I kept the record open until October 28, 2019, to give Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence. On that date, he wrote to provide details on what steps he \nhas taken to prepare his delinquent tax returns and to request 45 additional days to \ncomplete his tax returns. I informed Applicant that the record was closed. I marked that \nemail as AE D, and I marked the Government\u2019s Exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit 1. All \nexhibits were admitted without objection. I received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October \n11, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file his 2011-2017 federal \nand state taxes as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). I have incorporated his admissions in \nmy findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 1, his security \nclearance application (SCA), dated February 9, 2018, unless otherwise indicated by a \nparenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 64, works as a senior engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked \ncontinuously since at least 1995, with two periods of unemployment, one in 2015 and a \nsecond shorter period in 2017. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1978. From 1979 to \n1994, he held a secret clearance while working for a defense contractor. He has applied \nfor a clearance in connection with his current position, which he has held since October \n2017. He is married and has two adult children.  \n \n \nIn his February 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had not filed his federal and \nstate income tax returns since 2010. He wrote that he believed that he has adequate \nwithholding to pay his tax liabilities and was \u201cin the process of gathering the required \ninformation to file the appropriate tax forms and seeking the services of a tax \nservice/accountant to help catchup.\u201d He blamed his delay on missing paperwork. At that \ntime, his 2017 tax returns were not yet due. (GE 1 at 34.) \n \n \nIn his April 26, 2018 background interview, Applicant again blamed his delinquency \non missing paperwork. He told the investigator that he planned to hire a CPA by the end \nof May 2018 and has a goal of completing all of his returns by July 2018. He said that he \nhad not dealt with this issue because of \u201canxiety and time.\u201d He also said that he did not \nbelieve that he owes any back taxes. In his February 28, 2019 response to DOHA\u2019s \n\n3 \n \ninterrogatories, Applicant disclosed that he has not filed his 2018 federal or state income \ntax returns. He also wrote that he was \u201ccurrently working CPA (sic) and submitting back \ntax forms. Federal 2011 has been filed and working on 2012 and other years.\u201d He \nindicated that the 2011 tax returns were filed on February 28, 2019, the date of his \nresponse. At the hearing, he submitted a letter from the IRS covering tax year 2011 \nshowing that he was due a refund of $28,283. (GE 2 at 4, 5, 9; AE A.) \n \n \nIn his April 24, 2019 SOR response, Applicant wrote that he and his wife had \ndifficulty filing returns for his wife\u2019s business. He indicated that he needed those returns \nto file his income tax returns. Since 2011, they have not been able \u201cto catch up.\u201d He wrote \nthat he expects to file his returns within the next two to three months. Applicant received \nnotice of his September 25, 2019 hearing on September 6, 2019. He appeared at the \nhearing without having filed any additional tax returns. As noted, I left the record open for \nan additional month to give Applicant the opportunity to take whatever steps he desired \nto take. After that month, his response was that he needed an additional 45 days to work \nwith his tax preparation firm to complete the delinquent tax returns. He commented that \nhe was \u201cactively working\u201d on the details necessary for the preparation of his tax forms. \nUnder the circumstances, I declined to grant Applicant\u2019s request closed the record, but I \nadmitted his email into the record as evidence of the status of his efforts as of the close \nof the record. (App. Ex. D at 1-2.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted at the hearing two photographs depicting his tax records in \nplastic boxes with each year carefully labeled. He testified the tax firm that prepared his \n2011 tax returns was the same firm he and his wife used prior to 2010. He offered no \nexplanation as to why they did not continue with that tax preparation service in the years \nfollowing 2010. He stated further that he would like to have everything filed by the end of \nthe year and could probably complete his 2012 returns in a week or at least within the \nnext 30 days. He testified that he felt anxious preparing the documentation needed to fill \nout his tax forms. He could not explain why that was such a problem if he believed he \nwould receive tax refunds. (AE C; Tr. 8-17, 29.) \n \n \nApplicant presented information regarding his background and his charitable work. \nHe is a member of one or more boards of charitable organizations. He has also spent \nsignificant periods taken caring of his sick, elderly parents before they died. He provided \nassurances that in every other part of his life, he follows the rules. (Tr. 21-23, 43.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \n\n4 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response, testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying condition under this \nguideline for the two SOR allegations: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d) and 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \n. . . as required.\u201d)  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent, frequent, and was \nnot in response to any unusual circumstances. Since submitting his SCA in August 2018, \nApplicant has only filed his federal and state tax returns for one year, 2011. Due to the \n\n6 \n \ninstant security clearance process, and in particular his hearing, Applicant is beginning to \ntake his tax filing responsibilities more seriously, and the evidence reflects that he will \nlikely file the delinquent returns in the next few months, and possibly sooner. His pattern \nof behavior, however, starting in 2012 when his 2011 tax returns were due to be filed, \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. To the extent that his parent\u2019s illnesses and deaths \nmay have contributed to Applicant\u2019s problems preparing his taxes, these problems did not \ninterfere with his pursuit of a successful career. He just did not prioritize his taxes due to \nhis anxiety about collecting the necessary paperwork. In any event, he did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is also not established. Applicant has been informing the Government \nsince he submitted his SCA that he was working on his taxes with a CPA. He has made \nno arrangements with the IRS or his state tax authorities to schedule the filing of his taxes \nto bring himself into compliance. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. I have taken into \nconsideration Applicant\u2019s age, maturity, important position as a government contractor, \nand the absence of any significant reason for his failure to file his tax returns since he \nsubmitted his SCA, let alone back when they were originally due.  \n \n\n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to address the security concerns \nraised by his mistakes and errors in judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all of the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his pattern of serious tax filing delinquencies. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 28, 2016. On \nFebruary 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 20, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On June 28, 2019, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on July 10, 2019, \n\n \n2 \n \nand did not respond. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 6 \nare admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included documents that are \nmarked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. The case \nwas assigned to me on September 12, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), his \nSCA (Item 3), and a summary of his security clearance interview (SI) (Item 6). Item 6 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Item 6. The Government included in the FORM a \nprominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 6 on \nthe ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not \nraise any objection to Item 6 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to \nthe FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 6 \ncould be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, including a \ncopy of Item 6. He did not respond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item 6. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He separated from his wife of 27 years in December \n2015, and divorced on a date not specified in the record. They have three adult children. \nHe honorably served in the U.S. Army from 1983 through 1989. He earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1987. He was previously granted a DOD security clearance in \n1988.  \n \nApplicant has been employed by the same defense contractor since January \n2008, except for a period between March 2015 and July 2016 when he was separated \ndue to a reduction in force (RIF). He received severance pay of an unspecified amount, \nwhich he used for support during the RIF. Since April 2015, Applicant has also worked \npart time as a self-employed contractor (which after July 2016 consisted of working \nremotely outside of his full-time employment hours). (SOR Answer at 3; Item 3 at 12-13; \nItem 6 at 7)  \n \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent credit-card debts totaling $63,736 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n\u2013 1.e), and that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose any of them on his SCA (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). Applicant admitted each of the alleged debts, but denied any deliberate intent to \nfalsify his SCA. Two accounts were charged-off by Creditor 1 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), and \nthree by Creditor 2 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e).  \n \nApplicant resolved two of the three debts owed to Creditor 2 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e) in November 2018. While he proffered documents asserting that he resolved all \nthree debts owed to Creditor 2 (AE B, C, F), the account numbers referenced therein \ndid not match those listed on the credit reports. Thus, it was unclear to which SOR debt \neach document related. However, the Government conceded that the two resolved \ndebts were SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($8,061) and 1.e ($7,815), and that SOR \u00b6 1.c remained \nunresolved. (FORM at 2-3)  \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s three unresolved debts total $47,860, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($24,820 \nowed to Creditor 1), 1.b ($13,799 owed to Creditor 1), and 1.c ($9,241 owed to Creditor \n2). In July 2018, Creditor 2 offered to settle the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The record \ndid not specify who wrote \u201cPaid\u201d on the copy of that offer (AE D), nor was any other \ncorroborating documentation provided. In December 2018, Applicant finalized an \nagreement with Creditor 1 to repay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Under the terms of \nthat agreement, he was obligated to pay $7,000 via monthly payments of $200 between \nDecember 2019 and October 2021. (AE A). He did not provide proof of any completed \npayments. In February 2019, he was in the process of negotiating a settlement with \nCreditor 1 for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the current status of which was not \nspecified. (AE E).  \n \nApplicant certified his \u201cno\u201d response to whether he had any financial \ndelinquencies on his SCA in July 2016. His certification included that \u201cmy statements on \nthis form . . . are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and \nare made in good faith.\u201d He was interviewed in August 2017 in connection with his \nsecurity-clearance investigation to discuss, among other things, the contents of his \nSCA. \n \nApplicant made inconsistent statements about his financial issues throughout his \nAugust 2017 SI. Initially, Applicant stated that he was financially stable and able to pay \nhis bills, and maintained that there were no issues with his finances. After being \nconfronted at the end of the interview, he acknowledged eight delinquent accounts, \nincluding the five alleged in the SOR. He claimed that he did not list them on his SCA \nbecause he did not find out that they were delinquent until after he submitted it in July \n2016. By September 2016, three of the alleged debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e) were in \ncollection status and delinquent at least 180 days, and the other two (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.b) \nwere delinquent at least 90 days. (Item 6 at 9-10; Item 5 at 6, 8 and 13; FORM at 3) \n \nDuring the initial discussion about his specific delinquent debts, Applicant \naverred that each of them were current as of the date of the SI. He later admitted that \nthey were not, in fact, current because his divorce attorney advised him not to pay them \nuntil the divorce was finalized (which had not yet occurred). While the Government \nargued the inconsistencies among Applicant\u2019s various SI statements, its falsification \nallegation in the SOR pertained only to the SCA not the SI. As such, it will be \nconsidered only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. (Item 6 at 9-10; \nFORM at 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer (including February and March 2019 letters, and two \nApril 2019 emails) also contained inconsistent statements about when he first knew \nabout his financial indebtedness. In the February letter, he attributed his financial \nindebtedness to his period of unemployment between March 2015 and July 2016, his \ndivorce proceedings, and the fact that he had two children in college. He stated that, \nduring that time, he incurred \u201ca significant amount of debt\u201d in order to support himself \nand his family. He asserted that he had been working to settle his debts since he \nregained employment in August 2016. Although the date of his divorce is not otherwise \n\n \n4 \n \nspecified in the record, he referred to his \u201cex-wife\u201d in the February letter, which \npresumes that his divorce had been finalized by then.  \n \nIn the March letter, Applicant repeated the aforementioned facts of his February \nletter and added a comment about the falsification allegation: that he did not have \nknowledge of the debts alleged in the SOR until 2018. In the first April email, he stated \nthat, at the time he completed his SCA in 2016, he had no knowledge of the credit-card \ndebts caused by his divorce. Without specifying a date, he stated that his debts had \n\u201crecently surface[d]\u201d when he was contacted by a collection agency. He averred that his \nfinancial record was \u201cimpeccable and in great standing\u201d until his divorce. In the second \nApril email, he reiterated that he had \u201cno knowledge of financial delinquency\u201d at the time \nhe completed his SCA, and that he learned of his delinquencies after being contacted \nby a collection agency \u201cafter [his] divorce.\u201d \n \nThe record did not enumerate either the income that Applicant earned from his \nfull-time and part-time employment, or his expenses (besides the $2,500 per month he \npaid or has been paying over an unspecified period for alimony and housing), during the \nrelevant period immediately preceding his unemployment through present. (Item 6 at 7). \nThe Government identified the areas in which Applicant failed to provide documentary \nevidence to support his mitigation case. He was also advised of the opportunity to \nsubmit that evidence in his FORM response. He did not respond to the FORM. (FORM \nat 2-3) \n \n       Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n\n \n6 \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has substantial delinquent debts that remain unresolved. He failed to \ndemonstrate that he acted responsibly to address them. He regained employment in \nAugust 2016 and, during his unemployment period, had access to severance pay and \npossibly income from his part-time employment. Applicant is credited with resolving the \ntwo smallest SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) and for initiating actions to resolve the \nother three, especially since he tackled four of them well before issuance of the SOR.  \n \nExacerbated by his failure to respond to the FORM, the record contains \ninsufficient detail and documentation about his ongoing efforts and ability to repay the \nremaining debts. The fact that \u201cPaid\u201d was handwritten on the copy of the settlement \noffer for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. was not sufficient to establish that Applicant \neither accepted the offer or paid the debt. Because he did not provide sufficient proof, I \nam also unable to conclude that he has either resolved or is making payments towards \nresolution of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \nApplicant failed to establish a meaningful track record of regular and timely \npayments or otherwise demonstrate that: 1) he will follow through with repaying his \nremaining debts, 2) he is currently managing his finances responsibly, and 3) his \nfinancial indebtedness is not likely to recur. Thus, I cannot conclude that Applicant has \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of his SCA, the following \ndisqualifying condition under this guideline could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an Appellant\u2019s state \nof mind at the time of the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, \n2004). An applicant\u2019s level of education and experience are relevant to determining \nwhether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance application \nwas deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) \n \nApplicant consistently asserted that he was not aware of the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR until after he completed the SCA. However, he made contradicting \nstatements to explain when he initially became aware of the debts. Those \ninconsistencies significantly undermined his credibility. His lack of candor during the SI \n\n \n8 \n \nsuggests that he was aware of the potentially negative impact his financial indebtedness \ncould have on his security clearance. I find substantial evidence of an intent on the part \nof the Applicant to falsify his SCA. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \n \nNeither of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in \nrequesting a security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the \nhonesty of the applicant. Beginning with an applicant\u2019s responses in the application, \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a \ncompelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. \nThat compelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in \nbeing able to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to \nthe government in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002) \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his known financial indebtedness on his SCA was \nsecurity significant. His subsequent inconsistencies and lack of candor during the SI \nand in his SOR answer undercut mitigation. I have doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n9 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his financial indebtedness and deliberate falsification of his SCA. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 5, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on May 8, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 2, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled on October 30, 2019.  \n \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which \nwere admitted without objection. Additionally, Department Counsel stipulated that two of \nApplicant\u2019s documents that were not offered into evidence contained the information \nthat Department Counsel read into the record.  \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iraq. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer for about two years. He is married but separated. He has three \nchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 30; GE 1-3) \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents.

His wife did not \nstay and moved back to Iraq with their two youngest children in 2010. Their oldest child \nbecame a U.S. citizen. When Applicant accepted his current job, he knew he would be \nworking overseas and unable to care for his oldest child. He took his oldest child back to \nIraq in 2017 to stay with his parents. (Tr. at 30-31, 36-37, 57-59; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1-3) \n \n \nWith the exception of his oldest child who is a U.S. citizen living in Iraq, all of \nApplicant\u2019s family, including his parents, wife, children, seven siblings, and their families \nare citizens and residents of Iraq. The husband of one of his sisters is an officer in the \nIraqi military. The husband of another sister is a police officer and employee of the \nMinistry of Defense. Applicant credibly testified that his family in Iraq could not be used \nto coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. (Tr. at 39-40, 51-73; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \n \nApplicant submitted documents and letters from members of the U.S. military \nattesting to his outstanding service as a linguist and cultural advisor in support of \ncombat operations. He is praised for his bravery during combat patrols, professionalism, \ndedication to duty, and integrity. (AE A) One military member wrote of Applicant: \n \nBeing an only child myself, I have always judged my friends by the criteria \nthat I wanted in a brother. There have been some harrowing days during \nour tour, and through it all, there was one man who stood up and \nanswered the call every time it went out. His bravery, professionalism, and \nmoral character were the exact things I would want in a sibling. (AE A) \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, wife, two of his children, seven siblings, and their families \nare citizens and residents of Iraq. His oldest child is a U.S. citizen living in Iraq. The \nhusband of one of his sisters is an officer in the Iraqi military. The husband of another \nsister is a police officer and employee of the Ministry of Defense. The potential for \nterrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and it \ncontinues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable:  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \n\n \n5 \n \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The \nAppeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, \nunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist and cultural advisor \nfor the U.S. military in Iraq from about 2005 to 2009, which earned him a special \nimmigrant visa. U.S. military personnel who worked with him praised his service. I find \nthat Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him high praise from U.S. \nmilitary personnel. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of \naction in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable \nresult for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n20, 2007). The complicated state of affairs in Iraq places a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his family members in Iraq do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. He has met that burden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Applicant responded to the SOR on April 15, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 12, \n2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non June 20, 2019, scheduling the hearing for July 25, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nadmitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation.

He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in July 2007 as a \nmeans to keep his house from foreclosure. The petition listed $293,000 owed on a \nmortgage loan; $40,000 for an auto loan on a sport utility vehicle (SUV), and $6,500 in \nunsecured claims. The bankruptcy was dismissed in September 2007. (Tr. at 13-14, 26-\n30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6) \n \n \nApplicant did not pay all of his federal and state income taxes when they were \ndue. In April 2018, he estimated that he owed the IRS $20,000. He indicated post-\nhearing that he has been in contact with the IRS, who informed him that he owed more \nthan $60,000.

He wrote that the state has yet to send him \nany forms, and he is \u201cstill reaching out to them.\u201d (Tr. at 14-20, 33-35; GE 1-3; AE B, C, \nE-G) \n \n \nApplicant did not pay his mortgage loan. Credit reports from January 2018, \nJanuary 2019, and April 2019 listed the loan as $75,780 past due and in foreclosure, \nwith a balance of $323,324, and a date of last action of May 2015. He lost his home to \nforeclosure. There is no evidence that the house has been sold or if there is a deficiency \non the loan after a sale.

He stopped paying \nthe loan on the sports car at some point. The car was not repossessed. He maintained \nthe car at a friend\u2019s house, at least in part so that the creditor could not repossess it. A \nJanuary 2018 credit report listed the charged-off loan for the sports car with a $12,433 \nbalance. Applicant settled and paid the debt in about August 2018. He sold the car after \nthe lien was released. He also stopped paying the loan for the SUV, and it was \nrepossessed.

The debts are listed on a \nJanuary 2018 credit report with dates of last action on the accounts listed as December \n2011 and January 2012. Applicant denied owing the debts, and they are not listed on \nthe 2019 credit reports. (Tr. at 41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5; AE E-G) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $150,000. Except for the six months of \nunemployment in 2015, he has been consistently employed with annual salaries in \nexcess of $100,000. He received financial counseling while he was in the military. He \nasks to retain his security clearance so that he can keep his job and pay his taxes. (Tr. \nat 23-27, 42; AE B) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including bankruptcy, unpaid taxes, \nand delinquent debts. Except for about six months of unemployment, he was \n\n \n5 \n \nconsistently employed, with annual income in excess of $100,000. He bought a $50,000 \nsports car, but failed to pay all of his taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2002 divorce, high child support \npayments, the loss of his job in 2015, and the subsequent six months of unemployment. \nThose conditions were beyond his control. His tax issues were not beyond his control. \n \n \nApplicant bought a sports car for about $50,000 in 2010 and an SUV in 2011 for \nabout $71,000. The car payments for the two vehicles would have been difficult to \nmaintain if he actually paid them, but he stopped paying both loans, as well as his \nmortgage loan. He maintained the sports car at a friend\u2019s house, at least in part so that \nthe creditor could not repossess it. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in 2007 is mitigated, as are \nthe two small debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. The loan for the sports car was \nsettled and paid, and the mortgage loan was apparently resolved by foreclosure. Those \nallegations are also mitigated. However, Applicant owes the IRS more than $60,000 and \nhis state more than $111,000. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018).  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to pay his taxes. His tax issues are \nrecent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid federal and state taxes are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service. However, he owes more than $170,000 in federal and state income \ntaxes. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not refute or mitigate the resulting \nfinancial security concerns, or the personal conduct security concerns related to his failure \nto disclose requested financial information. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 1, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on April 20, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. On July 22, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On July 26, 2019, DOHA issued \na Notice of Hearing setting the case for August 15, 2019. The case was heard as \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nscheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 into \nevidence. Applicant testified. He did not offer any exhibits. All exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 23, 2019 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and denied the \nremaining allegations in SOR \u00b6 1. He denied the two allegations in SOR \u00b6 2. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old and has been married since 1983. He and his wife have \ntwo adult children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1987. In July 2017, he started a \nposition with a defense contractor. Prior to this employment, he had been self-employed \nsince 2012. Before starting his business, he was a contractor for different companies and   \nalso experienced periods of unemployment. (Tr. 21-27; GE 1) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from August 2017 and January 2019, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the SOR alleged four delinquent commercial debts, and stated \nfour additional allegations related to his unfiled Federal and state income tax returns and \nunpaid Federal tax liens. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) The status of those financial matters \nis as follows: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: The $28,865 second mortgage debt has been delinquent and charged \noff since March 2014. Applicant has no intention to resolve it until he sells the house at a \nfuture date. (Tr. 31-33; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: This $947 credit card debt became delinquent in August 2016. \nApplicant said he settled it for $521 and paid it in March 2019. (Tr. 33-35) This allegation \nis resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: This charged-off $453 credit card debt became delinquent in 2016. \nApplicant disputes the charge, but provided no evidence substantiating a basis for the \ndispute. (Tr. 35-37: GE 3; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: The $280 collection account for an unpaid phone bill became \ndelinquent in 2017. Applicant said he disputes this charge and has no intention of paying \nit, but provided no substantiation. (Tr. 37-39; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant has not filed his Federal and state income tax returns since \n1992. He stated that he declined to file them because he does not consent to being taxed \non his labor, such as a payroll tax; hence, he believes he is not legally required to file the \nthe returns. (Tr. 40-45; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Applicant has not paid the $38,215 Federal income tax lien entered \nagainst him in October 2018. Applicant does not intend to pay the debt because he does \nnot believe he has a legal obligation to pay taxes on his labor, unless he consents to the \ntax. (Tr. 45-46; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: Applicant has not paid the $61,297 Federal income tax lien entered \nagainst him in October 2005. He does not intend to pay the debt because he does not \nbelieve he has a legal obligation to pay taxes on his labor, unless he consents to the tax. \n(Tr. 45-46; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: Applicant has not paid the $351,636 Federal income tax lien entered \nagainst him in April 2004. He does not intend to pay the debt because he does not believe \nhe has a legal obligation to pay taxes on his labor, unless he consents to the tax. This \nlarge lien is partially attributable to capital gains he earned in the early 2000s, in addition \nto income from employment. (Tr. 45-46, 58-60; Answer) This allegation is unresolved. \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2 alleges Applicant deliberately denied and failed to disclose his failure to \nfile his tax returns and his tax liens on his August 2017 security clearance application \n(SCA). In that SCA, he denied that he had not filed Federal and state income tax returns \nsince 1992, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant asserted that he did not falsify his SCA \nabout this issue because he did not believe he was legally required to file tax returns, as \nhe did not consent to being taxed on employment income. (Tr. 48-49; GE 2; Answer) \n \n \nIn his August 2017 SCA, Applicant also denied that tax liens had been placed on \nhis property for tax years 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He did not disclose that he \nwas indebted to the United States for Federal income taxes in the total amount of \n$451,148 for the Federal tax liens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. He has since denied \nthat he deliberately failed to disclose that information. He stated that he was unaware of \nthe unpaid taxes and liens. He claimed that he ignored notices he and his wife received \nrelating to them. He asserted that he is not required to file returns or pay taxes on any \npayroll money he received over the years. (Tr. 47-51; GE 2; Answer) \n \n \nApplicant did not pay income taxes from 1992 until 2001. At that time, he was \npurchasing a home and in order to obtain a mortgage, he paid the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) $6,500 to resolve a tax lien and purchase a house. (Tr. 52) In March 2019, \nhe said he mistakenly paid the IRS about $2,500 from his salary because he did not fill \nout his W-2 Form correctly and failed to claim he was exempt from paying taxes. Other \nthan those two instances, 2001 and 2019, he has not paid Federal or state income taxes \nsince 1992. (Tr. 53-55)                         \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of deliberate failure to file required Federal and state \nincome tax returns, beginning in 1992 and continuing to the present. He failed to pay large \nFederal income liens that were entered against him in 2018, 2005, and 2004. He also \nfailed to resolve three delinquent commercial debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nsignificant security concerns under the above disqualifying conditions.   \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out conditions that could potentially mitigate the \nresulting financial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has not resolved his outstanding debts that became delinquent between \n2014 and 2017. He has not filed Federal and state income tax returns since 1992 (other \nthan in 2001 and 2019), or paid his outstanding 2018, 2005, and 2004 tax liens. He has \nno intention to pay or resolve these tax obligations, or other delinquent debts. His failure \nto do so casts doubt on his judgment. There is no evidence to establish mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies and refusal to responsibly manage his \ntaxes and other delinquent debts have been within his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has not participated in credit or financial counseling, and there is no evidence \nthat the financial concerns alleged in the SOR are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \n \nOther than paying off one credit card debt, Applicant has not made good-faith \nefforts to responsibly resolve his delinquent debts and tax issues. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \nprovide mitigation. Applicant stated he will not pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.d because he disputes them. He did not submit evidence to document a valid basis for \nthose disputes, or other attempts to resolve those debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant has no intention to file his delinquent Federal and state income tax returns or \npay any of his outstanding tax liens. There is no evidence to establish mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(g). \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant contends that he denied, and failed to disclose, information about his \nunfiled tax returns or report the tax liens filed against him because he believes he does \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nnot have a legal obligation to do so since he has not consented to the payroll tax. He \nacknowledged that he ignored notices sent to his home from taxing entities pertinent to \nthose issues. Regardless of whether he believes he is not legally responsible for filing \nreturns or paying taxes, he knew he had outstanding Federal and state tax issues, which \nhe was required to disclose in his August 2017 SCA. He deliberately omitted that \ninformation in his SCA. His attempted justification for not providing the information is not \npersuasive. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying condition.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides two conditions that could mitigate that security concerns under \nthis guideline: \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant failed to fully and frankly answer questions on his SCA about not filing \nhis tax returns and having tax liens entered against him. He did not provide credible \nevidence that his false responses on his SCA were based on the advice of reputable legal \ncounsel, tax professionals, or any other person with professional responsibilities for \nadvising or instructing persons on security clearance processes. His false statements \nregarding his tax issues and outstanding debts cast serious doubt on his fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. He did not establish mitigation under the above conditions. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent and articulate 57-year-old man, who has been working \nfor his current employer since July 2017. Despite becoming aware of the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns regarding an applicant\u2019s history of tax compliance and delinquent debts \nwhen he submitted his SCA in August 2017, Applicant took no action to address his 27-\nyear history of non-compliance or to resolve his $451,148 tax debt. Although he \nrepeatedly asserted that he is not required to file tax returns or pay taxes on income \nderived from his labor, and that he has no intention to do so, he provided no credible \nevidence from the IRS or a state revenue agency that his position is legally supportable \nor that he is exempt from income tax laws and obligations. His decision to falsify \nrequested information about those matters in his SCA was deliberate.  \n   \nAt this time, Applicant has not established a record of responsibly following tax \nlaws and managing related financial obligations. His long history of non-compliance with \na fundamental legal obligation to file and pay taxes, beginning in 1992, is significant. The \nDOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016).  \n   \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1: Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n    \n                  Against Applicant \n \n           \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n       For Applicant \n \n \n           \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1:h:  \n       Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2: Guideline E:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n    \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 58 years old and single. She is a high school graduate and has worked for her current employer since 2012. She has never held a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Tr. 15-16.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has failed to meet her financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations (1.a and 1.b), with attachments and explanations. 1.a. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her Federal tax returns in a timely manner for tax years 2010 through 2017. 1.b. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her state tax returns in a timely manner for at least tax years 2010 through 2017. In Section 26 of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) she admitted that she had not filed Federal or state taxes for tax years 2010 through 2016.

She did not submit evidence to show that any of the returns have now been filed. \nResulting security concerns were not mitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \n \nStatement of Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 19, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) On February 19, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, with attachments, on February 22, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. (Answer.) The Government was \nready to proceed on May 14, 2019. The case was assigned to me on May 21, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 20, \n2019, scheduling the hearing for July 30, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 7, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 58 years old and single. She is a high school graduate and has worked \nfor her current employer since 2012. She has never held a security clearance. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Tr. 15-16.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has failed to meet her financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations (1.a and 1.b), with attachments and \nexplanations.  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her Federal tax returns in a timely \nmanner for tax years 2010 through 2017.  \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her state tax returns in a timely \nmanner for at least tax years 2010 through 2017.  \n \n \nIn Section 26 of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) she admitted that she \nhad not filed Federal or state taxes for tax years 2010 through 2016. Asked for the reason \nshe stated, \u201cThe normal withholding/tax credits from previous years would adequately \nsatisfy the taxes owed,\u201d and, \u201cI have always insured that the normal withholding would \nadequately satisfy the taxes owed.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on May 9, 2018. During that interview Applicant was asked about \nher failure to file Federal or state tax returns from 2010 to 2016. The report stated: \nThe subject [Applicant] has not filed for her federal or state taxes since 2010 \nout of stupidity and feels embarrassed by it. The subject also hasn\u2019t filed \nbecause she believes she has gotten a refund each year and figured it \nwould all balance out. Regardless, the subject intends on filing within the \nnext few months and settling anything she might owe to include [any] \npenalty or fine. In the meantime, the subject has been gathering paperwork \nto prepare and has also contacted the IRS to request her transcripts for \neach year. (Government Exhibit 2 at 3.) \nInterrogatories were propounded to Applicant by DOHA on August 3, 2018. \nApplicant responded to them on December 18, 2018. Her response included IRS \ntranscripts from the tax years 2010 to 2017. The transcripts for tax years 2010 and 2013 \nthrough 2017 state, \u201cRequested data not found.\u201d  The transcripts for tax years 2011 and \n2012 do not show any information as to Applicant\u2019s income, or tax information. In \nDecember 2012 Applicant was sent an inquiry by the IRS as to why she had not filed her \n2011 tax return. She wrote in her Answer, \u201cState . . .  did not provide any data since \nreturns were not filed and money was not owed.\u201d (Government Exhibit 3.)  \nIn her Answer and at the hearing, Applicant argued that she did not have to file a \ntax return because she was owed a refund. In her Answer Applicant set out for each tax \nyear what she purported to be her income, the standard deduction, her taxable income, \nthe tax withheld, and any proposed refund she was owed. She did this for both the Federal \nincome taxes and her state income taxes. Applicant was unemployed in 2011 and 2012 \nand did not have any income information for those years. She stated that she wanted to \nhave complete information for all tax years before filing her tax returns. Applicant did not \nprovide pay stubs, W-2 forms or other documentation to support her statements as to her \nFederal or state income taxes. (Tr. 16-29.) \nIn addition, Applicant relied on a statement from the IRS website, \u201cThere\u2019s no \npenalty for failure to file if you\u2019re due a refund.\u201d (Internal Revenue Service, Topic 153 \nWhat to Do if You Haven\u2019t Filed Your Return, https://www.irs.gov /taxtopics/tc153 (last \nupdated Aug. 1, 2019). However, Applicant was reminded that the law states all persons \nwhose income is above the standard deduction must file a tax return. (Internal Revenue \nService, Publication 501; Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information; Filing \nRequirements for Most Taxpayers 3, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf (accessed \nSeptember 24, 2019). (Tr. 26-27.) \nWhen pressed, Applicant admitted that her conduct did not show good judgment. \nShe admitted to feeling \u201cstuck,\u201d and unable to move forward in filing her tax returns. (Tr. \n29.) \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state tax returns, as required, for at least \neight years. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \ncondition, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant did not file eight years of Federal and state income tax returns. In \naddition, at the hearing she showed no intention of filing them in the foreseeable future. \nShe has known for at least two years of the Government\u2019s concern, yet has taken no \nsteps to resolve that concern. It may be true that Applicant was owed refunds for the \naffected tax years, but that does not obviate the requirement that she file tax returns. In \naddition, she failed to present any evidence that the argument she made with regard to \nher Federal returns also applied to her state returns. The conduct is current and \ncontinuing. There is no evidence that Applicant failed to file the tax returns due to \ncircumstances beyond her control. Her unwillingness to abide by income tax rules and \nregulations that apply to all cast doubt on her reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant did \nnot mitigate her tax issues. Guideline F is found against Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that she would file her tax returns in the near future. The \npotential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the evidence \ncreates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. She failed to meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 22, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines H and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 13, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 30, 2019. The evidence \n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 2-3 (Item 1 includes pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on June 3, \n2019. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not file any objections nor submit any \nadditional evidence. Items 2-3 are admitted into evidence without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on July 18, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR, except SOR \u00b6 \n1.d, which alleged that Applicant intended \u201cto continue using marijuana in the future.\u201d I \nadopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He is single, never married, with no children. He has \nworked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since May 2008. He received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2008. (Item 2)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from \napproximately June 2002 to July 2018; that he purchased marijuana during the same \ntimeframe; that he used marijuana from July 2017 to July 2018, while granted access to \nclassified information; and that he intended to continue using marijuana in the future. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) The SOR also cross-alleged the same conduct under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. (SOR \u00b6 2.a)  \n \n \nApplicant listed his marijuana use in his security clearance application (SCA) \ncompleted in March 2017. He described this use from June 2002 to February 2015. \nDuring college, he used approximately three to five times a week; from 2009 to 2013, he \nused three to five times a month; in 2014, he used four to six times; and he claimed he \nlast used in February 2015. During his background investigation interview in August \n2018, he described two uses in October 2017; two unspecified times of use; and his \nclaimed last use in August 2018. He also admitted that he would continue using \nmarijuana recreationally unless he is required to stop. He continues to associate with \nfriends who use marijuana. He purchased marijuana from local dispensaries. He has \nnot participated in drug treatment or counseling. (Items 2-3) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he admitted using marijuana while being granted \naccess to classified information. He also modified his response regarding his future use \nof marijuana. He further stated he will only use marijuana in the future when it becomes \nlegal under federal law and-or it becomes necessary and prescribed by a physician. He \nthen further qualified this answer by saying that he would abstain from marijuana use as \nlong as it was prohibited under the Guidelines. Responding to the Guideline E \nallegation, Applicant admitted his questionable judgment by using marijuana, but stated \nthat he was ignorant about the difference between federal law and state law (where \nmarijuana use is legal). He also pointed out that he was candid and honest about his \nmarijuana use. (SOR answer)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three conditions are potentially applicable in this case, to wit: \n \n(a) any substance misuse;    \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and   \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana on multiple occasions between 2002 \nand 2018. He also used marijuana after being granted access to classified information. I \nfind that the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was frequent and, given his 16-year-pattern of use, \nhis claimed abstinence beginning in February 2018 is not sufficiently attenuated to be \nconsidered remote. Even more troubling than his frequent use was his use after he was \ngiven access to classified information. He has vacillated about whether he intends to \nuse marijuana in the future. Therefore, it is difficult to lend credence to his recently \nstated intention not to use in the future. He did not provide a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from all future illegal drug use, which acknowledged any future misuse would \nbe grounds for revocation of his security clearance. Applicant\u2019s short abstention is \ninsufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. His history of marijuana use, and \nhis use while holding a security clearance casts doubt upon his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not fully apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nNo specific Guideline E disqualifying condition applies, however, Applicant\u2019s \nfrequent use of marijuana from 2002 to 2018 while holding a security clearance \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndemonstrates questionable behavior and raises questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nHis frequent drug use was not minor. His actions create doubt about his overall \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment, and ultimately on his worthiness to hold \na security clearance. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that he used marijuana \nregularly for approximately 16 years and as recently as July 2018. He also used \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H \nand Guideline E.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs    1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph      2.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

He included some documents with his answer. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 45 years old. He has a high school education. He has been married since 1999. He and his wife have two grown children and a 17-year-old. He briefly served in the Air Force in 1994, before being medically discharged. Since at least 2006, Applicant has been employed as a designer and engineer, at or near shipyards along the coastal United States, in the defense industry or otherwise. Though he listed no periods of unemployment in his SCA, his background interview reflects that Applicant was unemployed between August and October 2009; from January to May 2012; from May to July 2013; and from November to December 2013.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 16, 2016. \nOn February 27, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within \nthe DOD as of June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2019, and elected a decision on the \nwritten record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n\n \n2 \n \n \n(DOHA), in lieu of a hearing. He included some documents with his Answer, and they are \nincluded in the record. On April 8, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 7. Applicant received the FORM on April 17, 2019. He was afforded 30 days after \nreceiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR and the answer (Items 1 \nand 2) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 14, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, \nall with brief explanations. He included some documents with his answer. His admissions \nand explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. He has a high school education. He has been married \nsince 1999. He and his wife have two grown children and a 17-year-old. He briefly served \nin the Air Force in 1994, before being medically discharged.  \n \n \nSince at least 2006, Applicant has been employed as a designer and engineer, at \nor near shipyards along the coastal United States, in the defense industry or otherwise. \nThough he listed no periods of unemployment in his SCA, his background interview \nreflects that Applicant was unemployed between August and October 2009; from January \nto May 2012; from May to July 2013; and from November to December 2013. (Item 4 at \n4-6) There is nothing to indicate that Applicant ever left a job due to his own misconduct \nor poor performance. Applicant has worked for his current employer, and sponsor for a \nclearance, since August 2016. There is no indication that he has ever held a clearance \nbefore. (Item 3) \n \n \nThe five SOR debts are established by credit reports in the record, from January \n2017 and September 2018. (Items 6, 7) In January 2018, in response to an interrogatory \nfrom the DOD CAF about several debts (including the SOR debts), Applicant says one \nhas been paid, one is to be paid, and that he is not responsible for the others, so he has \nrequested that they be removed from his credit report. (Item 5) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an account that has been charged off in the amount of $41,887. The \ndebt is for a home equity account Applicant opened in 2006. He admits the account but \ndisputes the amount owed. He said he fell behind on payments for about six months after \nhe was laid off from a job. He said he told the creditor about his situation, and made partial \npayments for a time, but then \u201clost track of payments and my records.\u201d He did not believe \nthat his payments were being properly applied. (Answer, Item 4) He disputed the account \nwith credit bureaus. He provided documentation with his answer that the account has \nbeen deleted from his credit report. (Answer) He provided no documentation from the \ncreditor showing any payments towards the debt, or that the creditor regards the account \nas resolved.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($824) and 1.c ($144) are past-due medical debts. Applicant denied \nthe debts and provided proof that they have been paid. (Answer) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,190) is a past-due debt to a phone company. Applicant admitted \nthe debt and provided an excerpt from his credit report documenting that he disputed the \naccount with credit bureaus and that it had been deleted from his credit report. (Answer) \nHe provided no documentation from the creditor showing any payments towards the debt, \nor that the creditor regards the account as resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a charged-off account related to a timeshare, for $11,619. Applicant \nadmits the debt. Applicant fell behind on the account after a job loss. (Answer; Item 4) He \nasserted that the timeshare had been sold by the creditor, and that he was not responsible \nfor the debt. (Answer) He provided no corroborating documentation. He provided no \ndocumentation from the creditor showing any payments towards the debt, or that the \ncreditor regards the account as resolved. \n \nApplicant provided no documents concerning his current financial situation, such \nas his assets, or monthly income and expenses.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe SOR debts incurred long ago when Applicant fell behind on payments after a \njob loss. They therefore occurred due to circumstances beyond his control. However, \nApplicant did not establish that he did much other than to dispute the debts with credit \nbureaus.  \n \nSome of the debts have been removed from credit reports after he disputed them, \nbut the mere fact that a debt has been removed from a credit report is not enough to \nestablish that the debt is resolved, or that any payments towards the debt have been \nmade. ISCR 17-00729 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2019) Applicant did not meet his burden to \nestablish that he acted responsibly to resolve them, or that he undertook good-faith efforts \nto do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply, except as to the two small medical debts, \nwhich are resolved. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to establish that his debts do not \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nApplicant also provided no documents concerning his current financial situation, such as \nhis assets, income, or expenses, evidence which might show his ability to resolve his \ndebts, or to avoid future financial trouble. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant has had past-due debts for several years. He did not make a reasonable \neffort to resolve them. He has failed to meet his burden of establishing that his financial \nissues are in the past, or that he is resolving them responsibly. The record evidence \ntherefore leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

She did not meet her burden in this case. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Adjudicative Guideline F \n(financial considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on July 31, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on August \n7, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM, and identified as Items 1 \n\n \n2 \n \nthrough 6, is admitted without objection.  The case was assigned to me on October 22, \n2019. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. Based on my review of the documentary \nevidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the financial concerns. \n                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a and 1.b and \ndenied 1.c and 1.d. (Item 1) She is 64 years old. She never married and has no \nchildren. (Item 3)  Applicant completed a security clearance (SCA) application in March \n2018.  Applicant obtained a technical diploma in June 2016 and has attended some \ncollege courses on-line. She has worked for her current employer as a voice technician \nsince 2018. (Item 2) She reported that she had a security clearance at one time but \ndoes not remember the date. \n \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.d alleged failure to timely file state and Federal income tax \nreturns from 2013 through at least 2017; a delinquent charged-off account in the \namount of $8,326; and a charged-off account in the amount of $5,070. (Item 1)  \n \n \nApplicant explained that she attributes the debts to a reduction in force from her \ncompany due to the end of a contract. (Item 4) She worked for that company for nine \nyears. Applicant worked abroad from 2008 until 2013. (Item 3) She could not find \nemployment and decided to return to school to upgrade her technical skills. During the \ntime from March 2015 through December 2017 while unemployed, Applicant used her \nsavings. (Item 2) However, at one point she deleted her savings by 2016, and continued \nher course work. She began to use credit cards to pay for the remaining year of her \ntraining. Applicant collected unemployment benefits in the approximate amount of \n$19,544 in 2015 and $15,400 in 2017. (Item 6) \n \n \nApplicant lived with her parents to reduce her expenses but could not find a job. \nHer two credit cards became delinquent. She made diligent efforts to resolve the \noutstanding accounts. In 2018, when she became employed, she began to resolve the \ntwo credit card debts. She submitted documentation that with respect to the charged-off \naccount in SOR 1.c, in the amount of $8,326. She arranged a payment plan in 2018, \nhas made eleven payments ($300 a month) and has 4 remaining payments. (Item 2) \nApplicant settled the charged-off credit card in the amount of $5,070 for $1,500 and \nsubmitted a letter that confirmed the account was settled in February 2019. (Item 2) \nApplicant also paid some non-SOR debts. (Item 5) \n \n \nRegarding her failure to file the Federal and state income tax returns, Applicant \nexplained that she moved several times or lost or misplaced documents which she \nneeded to file tax returns. She stated that she is working to retrieve the missing \ninformation. She claims that she does not owe any outstanding taxes. Applicant also \nexplained that she had every intention of filing the taxes last year, but she became \ncritically ill and disabled for several months. (Item 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, and 1.b, Applicant disclosed on her SCA that she did not file her \nstate income tax returns from 2013 to 2017. However, she has filed her state income \ntax return in 2014. (Item 4) She failed to file the Federal income tax returns for tax years \n2014 through at least 2017. At the close of the record, the 2015 -2017 income tax \nreturns were not filed. (Item 2)  Applicant was unemployed and had no income for 2016, \nso she did not file that year. She further explained that she was living and working \nabroad and has moved several times and did not have access to her tax documents. \n(Item 4) \n \n \nThere is no information in the record concerning applicant\u2019s income or budget. \nShe was unemployed but began employment in 2018. There is no information \nconcerning financial counseling. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by credit reports establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \n19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d) \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant admitted and her tax transcripts confirm that she failed to timely file her \nfederal and state income tax returns, as required by law. In 2017, she filed the required \nincome tax return for 2014. Applicant\u2019s 2015-2017 income tax returns still have not been \nfiled. Her reasoning for not filing was living and working abroad for a number a years, \nwith many changes in residences and not having tax documents. This explanation is not \nacceptable. She was unemployed for several years but AG 20(a) and 20(b) are not fully \napplicable because she still has not filed all income tax returns as required by law. Her \nintentions to file in the future is insufficient and not mitigating. \n \nApplicant\u2019s two charged-off credit cards are under control. One has been settled \nand the other account has a few payments left to be resolved. Her unemployment for a \nnumber of years was the reason for the delinquent credit cards. AG 20(b) and 20(d) \npartially apply. Applicant paid other non SOR debts and she has not incurred any new \ndebt. However, I do not find for Applicant due to the unfiled income tax returns. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n6 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant encountered unemployment. She used her savings and unemployment \nbenefits but still incurred delinquent debt. When she began working in 2018, she began \nto resolve the delinquent accounts. One account is now settled, and the other account \nhas four remaining payments. However, her judgment with respect to the filing of \nincome tax returns for 2013, 2015, and 2017 provides doubts despite her intention and \ncommitment to file them. On balance, Applicant did not produce information sufficient to \nmitigate the security concerns about her finances.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with some questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance at this time. Because protection of the \ninterests of national security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining \ndoubts must be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/10/2019 \nDecision \n \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 26, 2017. \nOn February 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented \nby the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on June 28, 2019.  Applicant received the FORM on July 8, \n2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM and identified as Items 1 \n\n2 \n \nthrough 5, is admitted without objection. Applicant provided a response to the FORM, \nwhich is marked as AX A, with attachments. The case was assigned to me on August 26, \n2019. Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He reported no military \nservice.  He is separated and in the process of divorcing his wife. He has two adult \nchildren and one adult stepchild.  Applicant has not held a security clearance and is \nsponsored by the defense contractor with whom he has been employed since April 2017. \n(Item 3) He disclosed his financial issues on his security clearance application. \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.t that Applicant failed to file, as required, Federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016, and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 \nand 2016. (Items 2-5) The SOR also alleges delinquent debts in the amount of \napproximately $38,900. Applicant admitted the allegations listed in the SOR, with the \nexception of allegations 1.h, 1.l, and 1.o totaling approximately $4,877. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant provided various reasons for not filing his income tax returns, to include, \nthat he had no ability to pay and had a low income in 2016. (Item 2) He noted that he \nwould be filing the 2015 and 2016 taxes pending divorce requirements. He blamed \nunderemployment and unemployment for the accumulation of delinquent debts. In \naddition, as an only child, Applicant cared for his ill mother who died in July 2017.  (Item \n2) \n \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s 2017 SCA, he stated that could not file his taxes due to \nunemployment. He noted that he had delinquent debts. (Item 3) In his answer, Applicant \nstated that his general approach to \u201cfinancial recovery\u201d was to see what property \ndistribution income he would have pending the outcome of his divorce. He also pension \nfund money of about $38,000 that he would use when the divorce is final. However, he \nalso noted that the attorney fees in the amount of $3,000 to $5,000 prevent him from \nresolving his debts on his credit report. (Item 2) He has not set up any payment plans for \nhis unresolved debts. He explained that he is paying back money to friends who have \nhelped support him financially over the years. \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the FORM and provided updated information, dated June \n2019, regarding a court stipulation concerning ancillary matters concerning a divorce. He \nalso provided correspondence from his divorce attorney concerning various unresolved \nmatters in the divorce proceeding. He finally stated that he believes his wife executed  \ntwo mortgages fraudulently in his name and perhaps credit debts as well. Applicant stated \nthat in about  six to eight months he would be in a position  to know what his true debts \nare. He will seek legal counsel about possible fraud. He believes that after the divorce \n\n3 \n \nsettlement he will have money to address his delinquent debts and that the amount of \ndebt should be much smaller. (AX A, with attachments) \n \n \nApplicant submitted information concerning his pension benefits, income for 2017, \nand a 2018 performance evaluation that relects his work exceeds standards. (Item 2) \nThere is no information in the record concerning  financial counseling, or use of a budget. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n4 \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and other documentation in the record reflect non-filing of \nFederal and state income tax returns for years 2015 and 2016. Three disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline are established: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \n \n\n5 \n \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant provided various reasons for not filing his 2015 and 2016 Federal and \nstate income tax returns. He admitted that his delinquent debts were the result of \nunemployment, underemployment, separation and divorce, and the illness of his mother \nwho died in July 2017. Since he is uncertain of his financial situation pending the outcome \nof the final divorce, he has not resolved any of the alleged debts. Applicant\u2019s debts \nresulted from some circumstances beyond his control, but he has not resolved any of his \nfinancial issues and is currently unsure what he will be able to afford and when that might \nbe. He surmised that in six to eight months he would be in a better position. Applicant did \nnot articulate a good-faith reason as to why he has been unable to file his outstanding tax \nreturns. He did not report any financial counseling. He provided no evidence of any \npayments or a specific plan for repayment of his delinquent debts. He has been with his \ncurrent employer since 2017. In response to the FORM, Applicant submitted \ncorrespondence from his attorney and a court stipulation regarding ancillary matters \nconcerning the divorce settlement. He also alluded to possible fraud on the part of his \nwife when she fraudulently opened mortgages and credit obligations in his name. On his \n2017 SCA, he noted the failure to file and his debts. Applicant has not furnished \ndocumentary evidence that he has addressed any of the financial concerns. He has not \nmet his burden of proof.  None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n6 \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has never held a security clearance. He has worked for a number of \nyears as a contractor, but he was unemployed in 2016. Applicant is separated and in the \nprocess of divorcing his wife. He admitted that he has no specific plan at this point in time \nto resolve his financial issues due to the unknown outcome of the final divorce. He \nresponded to the FORM and admitted that he did not file his Federal or state income tax \nreturns for the years in question. He has been employed since 2017. Applicant noted that \nhe has large attorney fees to pay and cannot pay his debts. He repeatedly failed to fulfill \nhis legal obligations, as required by law. I find that he has not demonstrated good \njudgment or reliability.   \n \n \nThe record does not provide sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns \nin this case. Applicant provided various reasons for incurring the delinquent debts, but he \nhas not acted reasonably in this case. He gave no real reason for not filing the tax returns.  \nApplicant has not has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with explanations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at his present job in November 2017. He is a standardization and evaluations assistant. He served in the Air National Guard from 1984 to 2015, attaining the grade of master sergeant (E-7). He has a high school diploma. He has been married three times (1990- 1997; 1998-2005; 2016-present) and has three adult children. (Item 3) The SOR alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2019; that he owed delinquent federal taxes for 2015 ($1,713) and 2016 ($5,019); and that he accumulated 25 delinquent debts (mortgage debts, credit card debt, consumer debts, medical debt; and various other debt) totaling approximately $52,791. The debts were listed in credit reports from March 2018 and January 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.bb). (Items 1, 6-7) Applicant pointed out in his statement to a defense investigator that his financial troubles mounted when he accepted an overseas job, which paid about $25,000 less than what he was earning. Additionally, his wife was unable to secure employment at the overseas location in her skill area and settled on taking a lesser-paying job. These decisions were voluntarily made by Applicant because he wanted to experience living overseas with his wife. (Items 2, 4 (August 2018 subject ",

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n12/11/2019 \nDecision \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 25, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 11, 2019. The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-7 (Items 1-2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on \n\n \n2 \n \nSeptember 16, 2019. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections, but \nsubmitted exhibits (AE) A-D. Items 3-7 and AE A-D are admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on November 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with explanations. \nAfter a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in November 2017. He is a standardization and evaluations assistant. \nHe served in the Air National Guard from 1984 to 2015, attaining the grade of master \nsergeant (E-7). He has a high school diploma. He has been married three times (1990-\n1997; 1998-2005; 2016-present) and has three adult children. (Item 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2019; that \nhe owed delinquent federal taxes for 2015 ($1,713) and 2016 ($5,019); and that he \naccumulated 25 delinquent debts (mortgage debts, credit card debt, consumer debts, \nmedical debt; and various other debt) totaling approximately $52,791. The debts were \nlisted in credit reports from March 2018 and January 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.bb). (Items \n1, 6-7) \n \n \nApplicant pointed out in his statement to a defense investigator that his financial \ntroubles mounted when he accepted an overseas job, which paid about $25,000 less \nthan what he was earning. Additionally, his wife was unable to secure employment at \nthe overseas location in her skill area and settled on taking a lesser-paying job. These \ndecisions were voluntarily made by Applicant because he wanted to experience living \noverseas with his wife. (Items 2, 4 (August 2018 subject interview)) \n \n \nApplicant stopped paying a home improvement loan in approximately October \n2017, when he took the overseas job. His credit reports show that several other debts \nbecame delinquent around this time. He contacted several creditors about payment \nplans, but he could not afford the payments they were seeking. In September 2017, he \nsigned an agreement with an attorney to pursue bankruptcy proceedings. The record is \nsilent as to any further dealings with that attorney. In April 2019, Applicant used a \ndifferent attorney to file a Chapter 7 petition. All the SOR debts were included in the \nbankruptcy. The debts were discharged in August 2019, except that Applicant\u2019s 2015 \nand 2016 federal tax debts were not discharged and his mortgage on his residence \nremained enforceable. (Items 2, 4-7; AE B) \n \n \nApplicant claims that his 2015 federal tax debt was either paid with his 2018 tax \nrefund or \u201ccharged-off\u201d through bankruptcy. He failed to supply documentation \nsupporting either of these actions. He claims to be making $200 monthly payments on \nhis 2016 federal tax debt, but again failed to supply supporting documentation. \nApplicant supplied documentation showing that in May 2019, he listed his home for sale \n\n \n3 \n \nwith a realtor in an attempt to execute a short sale of the property. There is no evidence \nshowing the result of this attempted sale. Applicant completed the required bankruptcy \nfinancial counseling course. He disclosed to a defense investigator that his net monthly \nincome is approximately $5,343, with expenses of approximately $4,550, leaving a \nremainder of approximately $800. (Items 2, 4)  \n \n \nApplicant provided a recommendation letter from his current supervisor who is a \nretired Air Force officer. His supervisor recommends that Applicant retain his security \nclearance citing his overall excellent duty performance and his observed \ntrustworthiness. (AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n4 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant accumulated 25 delinquent debts, which he resolved through Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, and he failed to pay his 2015-2016 federal taxes. I find all the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and were resolved by a discharge in bankruptcy. He \nfailed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to take a lower paying job because he wanted the \nopportunity to work overseas is not a condition beyond his control. His wife\u2019s inability to \ngain employment in her chosen field and thereby having to take a lower paying position \nis a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, he did not act responsibly by failing \nto take any action to resolve his debts until he filed for bankruptcy protection in April \n2019. Overall, the record evidence does not support that Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \n \nApplicant completed his required bankruptcy financial counseling. Given the \nrecency of Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, it is too soon to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. Although bankruptcy is a legally \npermissible way to rid one of debts, it does not equate to putting forth good-faith efforts \nto pay or resolve the debts in the security context. Applicant failed to document any \npayments or agreements to the IRS concerning his unpaid 2015-2016 taxes. AG \u00b6 20(c) \npartially applies, but 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, his federal contractor service, his \nsupervisor\u2019s recommendation, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness. \nHowever, I also considered that he has made insufficient efforts to resolve his debts, \nbesides availing himself of bankruptcy protection. He has not established a meaningful \ntrack record of debt management, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his \nfuture debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.)   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.bb  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old information technology support technician, sponsored by a defense contractor since January 2019. He will begin working for the contractor only if he receives a security clearance. He graduated from high school in 1997 and has completed some college credits. He is single and has no children. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1998, and was discharged in 2001 with a general discharge under honorable conditions. Applicant held a security clearance from 1998 to 2016. The SOR alleges Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2005, and 2007 to 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he failed to timely file federal income tax returns for 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2013 to 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and he is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax years 2010 totaling $30,252 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); 2011 totaling $47,295 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); 2015 totaling $15,317 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and 2016 totaling $13,075 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to not filing his 2007 tax return when due, but stated that he filed his 2007 to 2012 tax returns in 2013. Applicant admitted that tax returns for 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2013 to 2015 were not filed when due, with explanations. Finally, Applicant admitted having federal tax debts for tax years 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016, but stated that he has entered into a monthly installment repayment plan with the IRS and has made payments since November 2017.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) were \nrevised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. Applicant answered the SOR on April \n30, 2019, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 8, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 19, 2019, scheduling the \n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for September 10, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, containing several tax-payment documents and \ncharacter letters. AE A was admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old information technology support technician, sponsored \nby a defense contractor since January 2019. He will begin working for the contractor only \nif he receives a security clearance. He graduated from high school in 1997 and has \ncompleted some college credits. He is single and has no children. Applicant enlisted in \nthe U.S. Air Force in 1998, and was discharged in 2001 with a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. Applicant held a security clearance from 1998 to 2016. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years \n2005, and 2007 to 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he failed to timely file federal income tax returns for \n2006, 2010, 2011, and 2013 to 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and he is indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for delinquent taxes for tax years 2010 totaling $30,252 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); 2011 \ntotaling $47,295 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); 2015 totaling $15,317 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and 2016 totaling \n$13,075 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to not filing his 2007 tax return when \ndue, but stated that he filed his 2007 to 2012 tax returns in 2013. Applicant admitted that \ntax returns for 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2013 to 2015 were not filed when due, with \nexplanations. Finally, Applicant admitted having federal tax debts for tax years 2010, \n2011, 2015, and 2016, but stated that he has entered into a monthly installment \nrepayment plan with the IRS and has made payments since November 2017. \n \nApplicant deployed overseas as a civilian contractor to: Qatar from 2003 to 2005; \nKuwait from 2005-2009; Spain (on a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) contract) \nfrom 2009 to 2012; and Afghanistan from 2014 to 2017. He contends that he was entitled \nto delay his federal income tax filings and payments while he was deployed to a \u201ccombat \nzone,\u201d and did not have to file tax returns or make tax payments until 180 days after his \nlast day in the combat zone, with additional adjustments based on the date he entered \nthe combat zone. It is generally understood that this IRS rule applies to certain civilian \ncontractors working in support of U.S. military operations in \u201ccombat zones.\u201d Qatar, \nKuwait, and Afghanistan are considered \u201ccombat zones\u201d for purposes of the IRS rule.  \n \nApplicant did not provide documentary evidence showing that this IRS provision \napplied to his particular deployments, the specific dates that his tax returns would have \nbeen due under the rule, or whether he filed applicable tax returns within the allowable \nperiod. Assuming the rule applied to Applicant\u2019s last qualifying deployment to Kuwait in \n2009, it appears he would have been required to file his \u201cdelayed\u201d federal income tax \nreturns, and pay taxes owed, within the 180-day deadline after leaving Kuwait. Although \nApplicant never filed his 2005 federal income tax return, he filed his 2006 tax return in \n\n \n3 \n \nNovember 2010, which may have been within the filing deadline (and paid the tax owed \nover the phone in June and December 2007 after receiving an IRS notice and speaking \nwith an IRS employee on the phone). His tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2012 were filed \nin 2013 after returning from Spain. It appears that these tax return filings were outside the \n\u201ccombat zone\u201d exclusion period permitted by the rule as there is no evidence that work \nfor NATO in Spain qualifies for the \u201ccombat zone\u201d or other exclusion. \n \nApplicant deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 and returned in 2017, and filed tax \nreturns for 2013 to 2016, in 2017. Again, he may have filed within the IRS \u201ccombat zone\u201d \nexclusion rule, but did not make that clear in testimony or evidence submitted. Of note, \nApplicant\u2019s IRS transcripts for tax years 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2015 show penalties were \nassessed, inter alia, for filing tax returns after their normal due dates. (GE 3) \n \nIn 2006, Applicant called the IRS from Kuwait to ask about when he was required \nto file tax returns. In testimony, he relayed a vague recollection of the conversation, but \nrecalled that he had a 90 day extension and did not have to file a tax return until he \nreturned to the United States as long as he did not owe any tax. He claimed that he made \na rough estimate as to how much tax was being withheld from his pay, and what he might \nowe. He held the same understanding for tax years 2007 to 2009. When Applicant moved \nto Spain in 2009, he claimed that he was given conflicting information by a NATO official \nand the IRS, and said; \u201cI heard \u2013 more or less, I heard what I wanted to hear,\u201d that he had \na similar \u201ccombat zone\u201d exclusion delay while working in Spain under a NATO contract. \n(Tr. 40) Applicant took responsibility for not inquiring further, and acknowledged that he \nmade a mistake, partially due to depression after his father passed away in 2010, partially \nfrom ignorance, and because he \u201cstopped caring.\u201d (Tr. 41-42) While overseas, Applicant \ntraveled extensively for personal pleasure to several countries in Europe, the Middle East, \nand South America. \n \nApplicant hired a tax consultant in July 2013, who told him the IRS would only be \ninterested in the previous six years and not to be concerned with filing the tax year 2005 \nreturn as he did not owe anything that year. Applicant filed his tax year 2007 to 2012 \nreturns with that consultant. He hired another tax consulting group in 2017 who filed \nreturns for tax years 2013 to 2017. \n \nApplicant did not pay his federal income taxes when due, for tax years 2010, 2011, \n2015, and 2016. Applicant testified that he earned about $120,000 per year while in \nAfghanistan and had very low expenses. He noted that he helped family members with \nexpenses, but he could not account for how much money he gave away. He spent \nhundreds of thousands of dollars earned in Afghanistan on personal travel and hosting \nfriends. (Tr. 70-76) Applicant admitted that he did not properly plan to pay his tax \nobligations, and when he returned from Afghanistan in 2017, he used the savings he had \naccumulated to pay for his living expenses while seeking a job. (Tr. 67) As of October \n2018, he owed over $105,000 in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest. Applicant entered \ninto a payment plan with the IRS, and agreed to pay $75 per month, beginning in \nNovember 2017. He has made the required monthly payments. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s character letters note his integrity, honesty, work ethic, and positive \ncharacter traits. Applicant testified that he currently earns over $120,000 in pay and \nveteran\u2019s benefits, has about $12,000 in savings, and about $10,000 in a 401K retirement \nfund. He has not had any financial counseling since leaving active duty. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n\n \n5 \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidentiary record are sufficient to establish the \ndisqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n6 \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues arose from his work in combat zones from 2003 to 2009, \nand 2014 to 2017, which presumably allowed him to invoke an IRS rule allowing him to \ndelay the filing of tax returns and payment of taxes owed after leaving the combat zone. \nApplicant failed to file tax returns when due, and pay taxes when owed.  \n \nApplicant did not file his 2005 federal income tax return, and well after the deadline, \nhis tax consultant told him not to. He filed his 2006 tax return in November 2010, which \nmay have been within the filing deadline (and paid the tax owed over the phone in June \nand December 2007 after receiving an IRS notice and speaking with an IRS employee \non the phone). His tax returns for tax years 2007 to 2012 were filed in 2013 after returning \nfrom Spain, seemingly outside the \u201ccombat zone\u201d delay rule. He deployed to Afghanistan \nin 2014 and returned in 2017, and filed tax returns for 2013 to 2016, in 2017. Again, he \nmay have filed some of these within the IRS \u201ccombat zone\u201d delay rule, but did not make \nthat clear in testimony or evidence submitted. Of note, Applicant\u2019s IRS transcripts for tax \nyears 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2015 show penalties were assessed, inter alia, for filing tax \nreturns after the due dates. \n \nApplicant did not pay his federal income taxes when due, for tax years 2010, 2011, \n2015, and 2016. He entered into a repayment plan with the IRS in 2017, and has been \npaying $75 per month under that plan. As of October 2018, he owed over $105,000 in \nunpaid taxes, penalties, and interest. Although Applicant earned a substantial income \nwhile overseas, he spent his money on personal travel and entertainment, as well as \nhelping his family members, rather than paying his federal income taxes. He admitted \nthat he did not plan properly for his tax obligations, and when he returned from \n\n \n7 \n \nAfghanistan in 2017, he used the savings he had accumulated to pay living expenses \nwhile seeking a job.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held: \n \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of financial responsibility with regard to tax obligations shows a \nhistory of financial irresponsibility. His financial problems have been longstanding and \nremain a current concern. I am not convinced he has overcome his propensity to spend \nhis income on personal entertainment at the expense of his federal tax obligations.  \nApplicant has shown that he could have contacted the IRS, even while overseas, to \nrequest guidance, and he twice retained tax consultants to assist him. Applicant could \nhave sought knowledgeable guidance on filing tax returns while deployed, and after \nreturning from deployments, but chose to largely ignore the issue. I am not convinced that \nsimilar behavior will not recur, and he continues to carry a substantial debt to the IRS \ndespite some personal savings and substantial income.  \n \nOverall, I believe Applicant preferred to remain willfully ignorant of his tax \nobligations while enjoying extensive personal travel and spent the money he should have \nsaved to pay his taxes. Based on the record presented, I am unable to conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are under control or are unlikely to recur. Applicant is \ncredited for eventually filing all outstanding tax returns and entering into an IRS tax \nrepayment plan under AG \u00b6 20 (g). However, that mitigating credit does not eliminate the \nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s overall financial irresponsibility as it relates to \nfiling and paying federal income taxes when required. I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to voluntarily abide by \ngovernment rules and regulations. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \n\n \n8 \n \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s personal \ndifficulties and assignments overseas do not overcome his history of financial \nirresponsibility and willful ignorance of his federal tax obligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.f: \n \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On March 28, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.) The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 8, 2019.  He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.)  On \nMay 15, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on May 16, 2019, and received by him on an unknown date.  The \nFORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant failed to respond to the FORM. Applicant did not object to Items 1 \n\n \n2 \n \nthrough 6, and they are admitted into evidence, hereinafter referenced as Government \nExhibits 1 thorough 6.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 44 years old.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree.  He is employed with a \ndefense contractor as a Flight Systems Engineer.  He is applying for a security \nclearance in connection with his employment.  Applicant began working for his current \nemployer in January 2016.      \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR \nidentified eleven delinquent debts that have been charged off, placed for collection, and \na repossession, totaling approximately $160,000.  Applicant admits to each of the \ndelinquent accounts listed in the SOR, except allegation 1.b., which he claims is now a \ncurrent account.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated March 21, 2017; January 3, 2019; \nand May 9, 2019, confirm the indebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 4, \n5 and 6.)      \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy inactive reserves from February 1995 to March \n1998, when he received an Other than Honorable Discharge for testing positive for THC \nduring a drug screening.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial indebtedness.  He attributes his debts to an \nongoing divorce and his plans to file bankruptcy when his divorce becomes final.  \nApplicant provides no other details concerning why the indebtedness occurred, when \nthey will be resolved, or if he is capable of resolving them.  There is no evidence of \nexplanation or mitigation regarding the following allegations listed in the SOR. \n \nThese delinquent debts are listed in the SOR and remain owing:  \n \n1.a.  A delinquent debt owed to BMW FIN in the approximate amount of $46,568 \nfor the balance due on a vehicle that was repossessed remains owing.  Applicant failed \nto submit anything in response to the FORM, to show any ongoing payments being \nmade.  This account remains owing.  (Government Exhibit 6.)    \n \n \n1.b.  A delinquent debt owed to ED FIN/ESA is past due in the amount of $474 \nwith a total balance of $32,624. Applicant failed to submit anything in response to the \nFORM, to show any ongoing payments being made.  The account remains owing.    \n(Government Exhibit 6.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.c.

(Government Exhibit 6.)   \n \n \nThe record is void of evidence in mitigation.  Applicant has not explained how or \nwhy he fell behind on his financial obligations in the first place, accumulating over \n$160,000 in debt.  He has not provided any evidence in mitigation.  There is no \ndocumentary evidence to show that he has done anything to resolve his delinquent \n\n \n4 \n \ndebt.  There is nothing in the record to indicate when his financial situation will be \nresolved, and whether it is likely to recur.  There is insufficient documentation in the \nrecord to show that Applicant can control his finances and live within his means without \ndifficulty.  He remains excessively indebted.       \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nEvidence from his most recent credit report dated May 9, 2019, reveals that \nApplicant still has nine charge-off accounts, one repossession, and one collection \naccount.  He remains excessively indebted to the creditors listed in the SOR.  He has \nfailed to respond to the FORM, and did not provide any documentary evidence to show \nthat they are being resolved in any fashion.  He only mentions that he is currently in a \ndivorce and will file bankruptcy when his divorce is final.  This is insufficient and failed to \nprovide mitigation.  The record lacks appropriate documentation to substantiate the \ninformation he has provided.   The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has provided no explanation for the delinquent debts, specifically how \nor why he got into debt in the first place.  He also failed to provide evidence in mitigation \nto show that he is doing anything to resolve the debt.  Under the particular \ncircumstances here, Applicant has failed to establish that he has acted reasonably or \nresponsibly with respect to his debts.  As it stands, Applicant has done nothing as of yet \nto resolve his debts.  He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely.  Most importantly, it has not been demonstrated that his current financial \nproblems are under control.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  In the Government\u2019s FORM, Applicant was \ntold to provide documentary evidence in response to the FORM that supports the \napplicable mitigating conditions.   Applicant failed to respond.  There is insufficient \ndocumentation in the record to show that Applicant has made any effort to resolve or \n\n \n7 \n \nwork toward resolving his delinquent debt.  Accordingly, Applicant has not demonstrated \nthat he is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/29/2019 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an electronic questionnaires for investigations processing for \na public trust position (eQIP) on November 17, 2017. On March 26, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines H and E. The DOD \nCAF acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 22, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. On June 4, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a complete \ncopy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents identified \nas Items 1 through 9. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 10, 2019, and timely submitted \nhis response, to which the Government did not object. Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in \n\n \n2 \n \nthe case. Items 3 through 5 are admitted into evidence. Items 6 through 9 are discussed \nbelow. Applicant\u2019s FORM response included a copy of the FORM, which is already part \nof the record. He also submitted one new document, which is admitted into evidence as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A. I sua sponte took administrative notice of several documents, \nas discussed below, which are identified in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through \nVI. The case was assigned to me on August 7, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI sua sponte took administrative notice of the fact that the use and possession of \nmarijuana is a criminal violation of federal law. Relevant federal guidance, issued by the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) in May 2015 (HE I); by the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA) in August 2016 (HE II); by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) \nin January 2018 (HE III); by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2018 (HE IV); and by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in October 2014 \n(Item 9), make clear that marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under \nfederal law, that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by states, territories, and the \nDistrict of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, \nand that federal marijuana laws supersede state laws.  \n \nIn October 2014, the DNI advised that that \u201c[a]n individual\u2019s disregard of federal \nlaw concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant \nin national security determinations.\u201d (Item 9 at 2). \n \nIn August 2016, the DEA denied a petition to reschedule medical marijuana as a \nSchedule II controlled substance, on the following basis: \u201c[Marijuana] does not have a \ncurrently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, there is a lack of \naccepted safety for its use under medical supervision, and it has a high potential for \nabuse.\u201d As of August 2019, marijuana remained listed by the DEA as a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance. (HE II; HE V).  \n \nEffective as of December 2008, the state in which Applicant resides enacted a law \nallowing for the medical use of marijuana, subject to various administrative rules and \nregulations, including that the qualifying patient be issued and possess a state-issued \nregistry identification card. (HE VI).  \n \nBecause neither party provided the May 2015, August 2016, January 2018, nor \nFebruary 2018 memoranda, I sua sponte included them as HE I through IV, respectively. \nSimilarly, I sua sponte included relevant portions of the August 2019 DEA Schedule I \nlisting for marijuana and the state law, as HE V and VI, respectively. The January 2018 \nmemoranda rescinded the previous memoranda of the Office of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral (ODAG), dated October 2009, June 2011, and 2013. Accordingly, I have not \nconsidered Items 6 through 8. Because these sua sponte actions did not affect either the \nrelative positions of the parties or my decision, prior notice to the parties was not required. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted these findings of fact from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 2) and eQIP (Item 3).  \n \nApplicant, age 39, is unmarried without children. He received his high school \ndiploma in 1998 and bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He has been employed as an \nadministrator by a medical benefits provider since 2014. This is his first application for a \nposition of trust.  \n \nThe SOR alleged, under Guidelines H and E, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana from \nMay 2002 through present, and his intent to continue using it in the future. It also alleged \nthat he was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated and possession of \nmarijuana in November 2012. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant was \narrested and charged with arson in May 2004. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted to \neach of the Guideline H and E allegations.  \n \nApplicant has smoked marijuana daily since May 2002. In one eQIP answer, he \nacknowledged that his use was recreational. However, in another eQIP answer and \nthroughout the rest of the record, he maintained that his use was medicinal for the \npurpose of addressing sleep issues caused by another prescribed medication that he is \nrequired to take for an ongoing medical condition. He obtained a state-issued medical \nmarijuana card in March 2017 for that purpose. The card expired in April 2019. A copy of \nthat card is not in record. Before being issued the card, Applicant purchased marijuana \nillegally from an associate. He has friends who use marijuana, but he does not know \nwhether they also have state-issued cards. He intends to continue using marijuana. (AE \nA; Item 2; Item 3 at 32; Item 4 at 9). \n \nIn 2012, Applicant did not feel impaired and believed that he was okay to drive \nafter consuming alcohol. The facts and circumstances surrounding his consumption of \nalcohol or whether he used marijuana prior to driving are not specified in the record. The \nofficer who pulled him over for a broken headlight noticed that Applicant\u2019s eyes were red \nand gave him a breathalyzer, which registered a blood alcohol content of .10%. The officer \nalso found marijuana in Applicant\u2019s backpack, which was undisputed in the record. He \nwas arrested and charged with driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. \nIn 2013, he pled guilty to one lesser charge of operating while impaired, and the two initial \ncharges were dismissed. He was sentenced to 93 days in jail (suspended), probation for \n12 months, and fined $1,945. Applicant completed the terms of his sentence, which \nincluded mental health counseling and 50 hours of community service. Neither a \ndiagnosis nor prognosis stemming from that counseling was specified in the record. (Item \n2 at 27-29; Item 4 at 7-8; Item 5). \n \nApplicant leased a vehicle in his name for the benefit of his then boyfriend. After \nthey broke up, Applicant no longer wanted the vehicle because it reminded him of his ex-\nboyfriend. In late 2001, he conspired with another friend\u2019s boyfriend (X) to commit \ninsurance fraud. X agreed to steal the vehicle and set it on fire, while Applicant would \nreport the vehicle stolen and file an insurance claim. Although Applicant regretted his \n\n \n4 \n \nactions and realized his \u201cgrave mistake\u201d immediately upon receiving notice from the police \nstation of the theft and arson, he proceeded with the plan anyway because he was \u201cscared \nof the consequences.\u201d In late 2003, a detective contacted Applicant to advise him to \nobtain an attorney because X, who was in prison for another crime, had confessed to his \nconspiracy with Applicant. Applicant was charged with felony insurance fraud, to which \nhe pled guilty. In mid-2004, the court placed him in a diversion program, consisting of 12 \nmonths of probation, five days of community service, and $16,000 restitution. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed the program. (Item 2; Item 3 at 30-31; Item 4 at 8-9).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use never negatively impacted his work performance. His \ncurrent employer promoted him three times. Applicant acknowledged the \u201cgrave error\u201d of \nhis decision to commit insurance fraud. He attributed that decision to being \u201cvery \nimmature\u201d and \u201cvery young and stupid.\u201d He described his 2001-self as a \u201cna\u00efve\u201d 22 year \nold, who was \u201cstuck\u201d paying for a car that he could not afford after his then boyfriend had \n\u201ctalked [him] into leasing it\u201d for him. He understood then, and now, that what he did was \n\u201cterribly wrong\u201d and was \u201chappy to face the consequences so that [his] conscience would \nbe clear.\u201d He is now a \u201cgrown man\u201d who is \u201cresponsible\u201d and has \u201cbuilt a career.\u201d He has \nno intention of participating in insurance fraud or any criminal activities in the future. (AE \nA; Item 2; Item 4 at 5-6, and 9). \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his marijuana use and insurance fraud \u201ccould make \none question [his] moral character,\u201d but argued that a \u201cwhole-person assessment\u201d would \nreveal that those actions \u201chave not determined the course of [his] life\u201d and that he is \u201cby-\nand-large a law-abiding, upstanding citizen.\u201d He also stated the following with regard to \nhis marijuana use: \u201cI understand the denial of my application for [a position of trust] since \nmarijuana is still a federally illegally drug.\u201d (AE A). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions. The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \n(Directive, \u00a7 3.2). \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust to support a DOD \ncontract, an administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nin the AG. (Directive, Enclosure 2). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthe guidelines in a  commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable \ninformation, in arriving at a fair and impartial decision.  \n \nIn addition to the guidelines, the Directive sets forth procedures that must be \nfollowed in trustworthiness adjudications. The Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate burden of \n\n \n5 \n \npersuasion to establish their eligibility for a public trust position. (Directive, Enclosure 3, \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15). The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing marijuana use, expressed intent to continue using marijuana, \nand marijuana possession charge establishes the following disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n\n6 \n \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant has used marijuana daily since 2002 for an ongoing medical condition \nand recreationally. The state in which he resides has allowed medical marijuana use since \nDecember 2018 for individuals who obtain and possess a state-issued registry \nidentification card. Not only has Applicant used marijuana in contravention of federal law, \nbut he also violated state law for a significant period, including while he was not in \npossession of a valid card. Of particular significance is his continued use of marijuana \ndespite knowing that state laws permitting medical or other marijuana use do not alter the \nfederal prohibition or existing national security guidelines concerning marijuana use. \n \nArguably, Applicant\u2019s 2012 charge would lack security significance if viewed in \nisolation, especially given that it was dismissed by the court. However, together with his \nongoing marijuana use, it underscores a pattern of questionable judgment that also calls \ninto question his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use, marijuana possession charge, and insurance fraud \nestablish the general concern involving questionable judgment and unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The insurance fraud also establishes the following \nspecific disqualifying condition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n \n\n \n7 \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information   \n \nApplicant has not established either of the following potentially applicable   \nmitigating conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \n \nNot only did Applicant demonstrate an egregious error in judgment when he chose \nto commit insurance fraud in 2001, but he did not own up to it until years later and only \nafter he was caught. While he expressed sincere remorse about the incident, which is not \nlikely to recur, the gravity of the offense and his delayed atonement precludes mitigation, \nespecially because he has also chosen to continue using marijuana illegally. \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline H, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s behavior \ncontinues to cast doubt on his good judgment and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered his positive work \nperformance history, the years that have passed without criminal charges, and the \ncompelling medical reason underlying his ongoing marijuana use. However, after \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant \nhas not mitigated trustworthiness concerns raised by his marijuana use and insurance \nfraud. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 13, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on March 29, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non April 24, 2019, and reassigned to me on June 12, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled on August 15, 2019.  \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were \nadmitted without objection. \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout India. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained \nin the request. Without objection, I have also taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in a document from the U.S. Department of State titled U.S. Relations with \nIndia. The facts are summarized in the written request and documents and will not be \nrepeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that India is the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracy, works closely with the United States on many matters, shares common \nstrategic interests, and generally respects the rights of its citizens. But it also continues \nto have human rights problems; it has been victimized by terrorist attacks; and \nrestricted, dual-use technology has been illegally exported to India.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2012. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Indian university \nand a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university. He is married with two children. (Tr. at 38, \n44; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant was born in India to Indian parents. He came to the United States on a \nwork visa in 1999. He was granted permanent residence status (green card) in 2007, \nand he became a U.S. citizen in 2013. India does not permit dual citizenship, and he \nrenounced his Indian citizenship when he became a U.S. citizen. His wife is originally \nfrom India. His older child was born in India, and his younger child was born in the \nUnited States. His wife and children are U.S. citizens. (Tr. at 20, 35, 49; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, parents-in-law, brother-in-law, and some extended family \nmembers are citizens and residents of India. His father in his 80s; his mother and \nfather-in-law are in their 70s; and his mother-in-law is in her 60s. His father used to work \nfor the Indian agency responsible for taxes, but he has been retired for some time. His \nparents-in-law were farmers before they retired. His brother-in-law works for a U.S. \ncorporation. (Tr. at 26, 29, 33, 54-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nBefore he came to the United States, Applicant bought a share of a parcel of land \nin India with a friend for about $2,000. Applicant\u2019s share of the property has appreciated \nto about $75,000. Applicant anticipates that the local restrictions that have made it \ndifficult to sell the property will be lifted. He plans to sell the property when they are \nlifted. (Tr. at 55-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents\u2019 home was severely damaged by a natural disaster. Applicant \nhas sent them about $200,000 over several years to help them restore the home. He \nmaintained a bank account in India to make it easier to transfer funds to his parents and \nthe contractors working on their home. He had about $6,000 in the bank account at one \npoint, but now that the construction is complete, the balance is about $160. He does not \nknow whether his parents plan to leave the house to him as an inheritance. (Tr. at 25-\n30, 52-53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant maintains frequent contact with his family in India. He also regularly \nvisits them. He visited more often while his parents\u2019 home was under construction. (Tr. \nat 35, 50-51, 54; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant has considerable assets in the United States. He has owned his home \nin the United States since 2005. The current value of the home is about $290,000. He \nhas about $90,000 equity in the home, having refinanced the mortgage loan to help pay \nfor his children\u2019s education. He has about $385,000 in retirement accounts. (Tr. at 22-\n25; AE A, B) \n \n \nApplicant has no plan to move back to India. Education is important to him and \nhis family. His wife graduated from a U.S. university. His older child is in college with \nplans to obtain a PhD. His younger child is in high school and equally enthusiastic about \neducation. Applicant expressed his undivided allegiance to the United States, which he \nconsiders his home. He credibly testified that his family and any property in India could \nnot be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information, and that he \nwould report any attempt to do so. (Tr. at 21, 31-37, 60-62; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant has family members, including in-laws, who are citizens and residents \nof India. He has assets in India. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy, works closely \nwith the United States on many matters, shares common strategic interests, and \ngenerally respects the rights of its citizens. But it also continues to have human rights \nproblems; it has been victimized by terrorist attacks; and restricted, dual-use technology \nhas been illegally exported to India. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and financial interests \ncreate a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and through his wife. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to India. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. His wife and children live in the United States, \nbut he still has family in India, including his parents and in-laws. None of his immediate \nfamily members have any current direct connection to the Indian government. Applicant \nand his wife gave up their Indian citizenships when they became U.S. citizens. He has \nno plan to move back to India. He expressed his undivided allegiance to the United \nStates, which he considers his home. He credibly testified that his family and any \nproperty in India could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation, and that he would report any attempt to do so. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to India are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His closest family, life, home, majority of \nassets, and professional career are in the United States. I find that it is unlikely he will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States \nand the interests of India. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are \napplicable. Applicant\u2019s assets in India are small in comparison with his U.S. assets, and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure him. AG \u00b6 8(f) is \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n09/11/2019 \nDecision \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has important connections to family living in Yemen. Yemen is in the \nmidst of a conflict and is a dangerous environment. Foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 14, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn February 21, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue access \nto sensitive information for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \n\n \n2  \n                                                                                                                                              \nrevoked. Specifically, the SOR set forth trustworthiness concerns arising under \nGuideline B (foreign influence). \n \nOn March 22, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On June 13, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On June 20, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. On July 24, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for August 7, 2019. \n(HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference. Applicant \nwaived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of his hearing. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 11) \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits; Applicant provided \nsome clarifying information concerning the facts in GE 2; there were no objections; and \nall proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 17-21; GE 1-2) Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits at his hearing. (Tr. 12) On August 17, 2019, DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing. The record was held open until September 9, 2019, to provide \nApplicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. (Tr. 10-11) Applicant provided \nseven documents which were admitted without objection. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE \nG) \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence trustworthiness concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Yemen. \n(Tr. 21; HE 4) Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of those facts, \nand I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 21) Administrative or official notice is \nthe appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. \n16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice \nat ADP proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing \nfifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Portions of Department Counsel\u2019s \nadministrative notice request are quoted with minor changes and without quotation \nmarks and footnotes. \n \nThe facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of \nwitnesses, names of other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his \nfamily\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. (Tr. 13-14; HE 3) His admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n\n \n3  \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant is a 37-year-old manager and lead integration architect employed by a \ngovernment contractor. (Tr. 14-15, 22, 28; GE 1) He needs authorization for access to \nsensitive medical information to enable him to expand his audit responsibilities. (Tr. 28-\n29)  \n \nIn 1999, Applicant graduated from a high school in Yemen. (Tr. 6) From 2004 to \n2006, he worked for the U.S. Government in Yemen as an accounting assistant. (Tr. 7-8, \n24; AE D) He studied English before coming to the United States. (Tr. 22-23) In 2004, he \nemigrated from Yemen to the United States. (Tr. 7, 22) In 2006, he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in computer information systems from a U.S. university. (Tr. 6) In 2011, he \nreceived a master\u2019s degree in business administration from a U.S. university. (Tr. 6, 15) \nHe had a 3.52 grade point average (GPA) during his master\u2019s degree program. (AE A)  \n \nIn 2011, Applicant married a native-born U.S. citizen. (Tr. 8) His eight-year-old \ndaughter was born in the United States. (Tr. 8) His spouse does not work outside their \nhome. (Tr. 34) He has not served in the military of any country. (Tr. 7) In 2015, Applicant \nbecame a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 60) \n \nThe only time Applicant returned to Yemen was in 2012 for two or three weeks \nafter his mother died. (Tr. 20, 36) He went to Yemen to assist his family. (Tr. 20) \nApplicant does not own any property or have any financial accounts in Yemen. (Tr. 30, \n32) Applicant has a right to inherit some property from his father in Yemen when his \nfather dies. (Tr. 31) Applicant owns a house (with a mortgage) in the United States, and \nhe has a 401(k) and bank accounts in the United States. (Tr. 34-35)  \n \nThe SOR raises the following foreign influence trustworthiness concerns:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges and Applicant admits that his father is a citizen and resident of \nYemen, and the Yemen government employs or has recently employed him. (Tr. 44; HE \n3) Applicant is unsure whether his father is currently working for the Yemen government \nbecause of turmoil in the government. (Tr. 44) Applicant has sent about $1,000 annually \nfor the last two years to support his father in Yemen. (Tr. 37-39) In the last five years, his \nfather visited Applicant in the United States. (Tr. 42) His father held a significant elected \nposition in the Yemen government for several years. (Tr. 41, 45-46, 53) He is out of \npower now because the Houthis control the capital. (Tr. 46) His father remains prominent \nin Yemen. (Tr. 53-54) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d allege and Applicant admits that four of his brothers and three \nof his sisters are citizens and residents of Yemen, and the Yemen government employs \none of his brothers. (Tr. 47-48; HE 3) Applicant sends each of his brothers and sisters in \nYemen about $25 annually as a gift to show he cares for them. (Tr. 40) He has contacts \nwith his siblings on a weekly to quarterly basis by telephone. (GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges and Applicant admits one of his brothers is a citizen of Yemen \nand a resident of the United States. His older brother earned his bachelors, masters, and \nPh.D. degrees in the United States and is currently a professor at a U.S. university. (Tr. \n\n \n4  \n                                                                                                                                              \n26-27) In 2016, his older brother became a U.S. citizen through marriage. (Tr. 27-28; AE \nG) None of his sisters or their spouses are connected to the Yemen government. (Tr. 50) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges and Applicant admits one of his sisters is a citizen of Yemen \nand a resident of Germany. (Tr. 51; HE 3) He is unsure about whether she has become \na naturalized citizen of Germany. (Tr. 51-52) \n \nApplicant has contact with his father and siblings in Yemen through WhatsApp, a \ncomputer application that enables one to communicate with a group of people, including \nsending pictures and videos at the same time. (Tr. 47-48) Someone in his family group, \nwhich includes his family in Yemen, will normally send a message on WhatsApp about \nonce a week. (Tr. 49, 52) The messages are not detailed, and they are mostly greetings. \n(Tr. 48-50) He does not disclose work-related information to his family in Yemen. (Tr. 67)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was notified that he was on his university\u2019s Athletic Director\u2019s \nHonor Roll. (AE B) The Director of Applicant\u2019s language education program described \nApplicant as conscientious, diligent, helpful, motivated, and intelligent. (AE C; AE F) \nApplicant\u2019s manager described Applicant as trustworthy, honest, committed to his \nemployer, and professional. (AE E)  \n \nApplicant said he is loyal to and supports the United States. (Tr. 61, 63) He loves \nthe United States and will abide by U.S. laws and rules. (Tr. 63) He is and will continue \nto be a good U.S. citizen. (Tr. 61, 63) \n \nYemen \n \nThe Kingdom of Yemen (colloquially known as North Yemen) became \nindependent from the Ottoman Empire in 1918, and in 1962, became the Yemen Arab \nRepublic. The British withdrew in 1967 from what became the People\u2019s Republic of \nSouthern Yemen (colloquially known as South Yemen). The massive exodus of \nhundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two \ndecades of hostility between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the \nRepublic of Yemen in 1990.  \n \nPublic rallies in Sana\u2019a (Yemen\u2019s capital) starting in late January 2011 against \nthen President Ali Abdallah Salih, inspired by similar demonstrations in Tunisia and \nEgypt, slowly built momentum. In November 2011, Salih signed the Gulf Cooperation \nCounsel (GCC) Initiative to step down and to transfer some of his powers to Vice \nPresident Abd Rabuh Mansur Hadi.  \n \nHuthi rebels joined forces with Salih, culminating in a major offensive against \nmilitary units and rival tribes and enabling their forces to overrun the capital. In January \n2015, the Huthis surrounded the presidential palace. Hadi escaped to Oman, and then \nmoved to Saudi Arabia and asked the GCC to intervene. In March, Saudi Arabia \nassembled a coalition of Arab militaries and began airstrikes against the Huthis. Ground \n\n \n5  \n                                                                                                                                              \nfighting between Huthi-aligned forces and resistance groups backed by the Saudi-led \ncoalition continued.  \n \nAmid rising tensions between the Huthis and Salih, sporadic clashes erupted in \nmid-2017, and escalated into open fighting that ended when Huthi forces killed Salih in \nearly December 2017. In December 2018, the Huthis and Yemen Government \nparticipated in the first UN-brokered peace talks since 2016. In April 2019, Yemen\u2019s \nparliament convened for the first time since the conflict broke out.  \n \nThe United States Department of State has issued a Level 4: Do Not Travel \nWarning due to terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, kidnapping, and armed conflict. The \nState Department reports that terrorist groups continue to plot and conduct attacks in \nYemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, \ntransportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.  \n \nAdditionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, \ncriminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of western organizations \nmay be targeted for attack or kidnapping. No part of Yemen is immune to violence. \nCritical levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, \npersist throughout the country. The U.S. Embassy in Sana\u2019a suspended its operations \nin February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to \nU.S. citizens in Yemen.  \n \nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing \nVisa Waiver Program. Under the 2015 amendment, citizens of Yemen are ineligible to \ntravel or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. The \nexclusion of Yemen from waiver eligibility reflects the determination of the Secretary of \nHomeland Security that the presence of an individual in that country increases the \nlikelihood that the individual is a credible threat to the national security of the United \nStates; that a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country; or \nthat the county is a safe haven for terrorists.  \n \nThroughout 2017, al-Qa\u2019ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS-Yemen \ncontinued to exploit the political and security vacuum created by the ongoing conflict \nbetween the Yemen government and Houthi-forces. AQAP\u2019s area of influence has \nincreased since the onset of the civil war. A large security vacuum persists, which gives \nAQAP and ISIS-Yemen more room to operate. Counterterrorism gains in 2017 removed \nseveral key leaders and decreased AQAP\u2019s freedom of movement, but AQAP and ISIS-\nYemen continue to carry out terrorist attacks throughout government-held territory. ISIS-\nYemen remained considerably smaller in size and influence compared to AQAP, but \nremained operationally active. ISIS-Yemen attacks increased in late 2017, exploiting the \ntenuous security environment in Aden. AQAP and ISIS-Yemen terrorists carried out \nhundreds of attacks throughout Yemen in 2017. Methods included suicide bombers, \nvehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), ambushes, kidnappings, and \ntargeted assassinations.  \n \n\n \n6  \n                                                                                                                                              \nYemen does not have comprehensive counterterrorism legislation and no \nprogress was made due to the state of unrest and the fact that most of Yemen\u2019s \ngovernment remains in exile outside of Yemen. Due to a lack of resources and \norganization, police forces throughout the country struggle to exert authority. \n \nIn 2018, human rights issues in Yemen included unlawful or arbitrary killings, \nincluding political assassinations; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arbitrary \ninfringements on privacy rights; criminalization of libel, censorship, and site blocking; \nsubstantial interference with freedom of assembly and association; the inability of \ncitizens to choose their government through free and fair elections; pervasive \ncorruption; recruitment and use of child soldiers; and criminalization of consensual \nsame sex-sexual conduct. Saudi-led Coalition airstrikes resulted in civilian casualties \nand damage to infrastructure on multiple occasions. Non-state actors, including Houthis, \ntribal militias, militant secessionist elements, AQAP, and a local branch of lSIS, \nreportedly committed significant abuses with impunity. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance [or a public trust position].\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority \nto restrict access to classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, \nunclassified information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based \non all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to \nthe procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made.   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n7  \n                                                                                                                                              \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n   \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance [or access to \nsensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the trustworthiness concern about \u201cforeign contacts and \ninterests\u201d stating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \n\n \n8  \n                                                                                                                                              \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has two conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and seven siblings are citizens and residents of Yemen. \nApplicant has frequent contacts with them. The Appeal Board has concluded that \ncontact every two months or more constitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. \nISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-\n09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once \nevery four or five months not casual and infrequent). Applicant is bound to his family in \nYemen by mutual affection.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are safety issues for residents of Yemen primarily because of terrorists \nand other lawless entities operating in Yemen as well as the ongoing conflict. The mere \npossession of close family ties with relatives living in Yemen is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her spouse has such \na relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, their immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-laws. \nISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)). \n\n \n9  \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe in-law presumption concerning foreign influence is not relevant here because \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s relatives are not citizens and residents of a foreign country.   \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Yemen with the United States, and the situation in Yemen places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with \nany family member living in Yemen or visiting Yemen does not pose a trustworthiness \nor security risk. Applicant\u2019s father is a prominent citizen of Yemen who held an \nimportant position in the Yemen government before Houthi forces seized the capital of \nYemen. His high profile in Yemen significantly increases the foreign-influence security \nconcern in this case. \n \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Yemen. The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 \nat *20-*21 n. 18 (App. Bd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a \nsecurity significance even when they are not prominent: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power \nbased on their prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is \nwhether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members \nin a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power \ncould seek to exploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. \nclassified [or sensitive] information that an applicant -- not the applicant\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- has by virtue of a security clearance [or \npublic trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- \nregardless of whether the person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n10  \n                                                                                                                                              \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified [or sensitive] information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged \nin espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom Yemen seek or have sought sensitive information from or through Applicant or his \nfamily, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the future. \nInternational terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively \nas capable state intelligence services, and Yemen, like many countries, has a problem \nwith terrorism. Applicant\u2019s family in Yemen \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant \ncomes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \nattempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, \n2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Yemen or visiting Yemen \ncreate a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on his \nfamily in Yemen in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise sensitive information. \nThese relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Yemen and has raised the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and \nfurther inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n11  \n                                                                                                                                              \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility [or eligibility for a public trust position], there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance [or \naccess to sensitive information]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, \n1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising security [or trustworthiness] \nconcerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those \nconcerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in [such] \ndecisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in 2004, and he became a U.S. citizen \nin 2015. His daughter, spouse, and older brother are citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. He earned his bachelors and master\u2019s degrees in the United States. He \nis employed in the United States. He took an oath of allegiance to the United States \nwhen he became a U.S. citizen.  \n \nApplicant has important connections to Yemen. He was born in Yemen, and he \nlived in Yemen until 2004. His father and seven siblings are citizens and residents of \nYemen. He has frequent contacts with his relatives in Yemen. He traveled to Yemen in \n2012. Applicant is bound to his family in Yemen by mutual affection. Applicant\u2019s father is \n\n \n12  \n                                                                                                                                              \nprominent in Yemen and held an important position in the Yemen government before \nthe Houthi\u2019s took control of the government. His brother is currently a Yemen \ngovernment official. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his family in Yemen. His \nfamily in Yemen continues to be at risk primarily from terrorists and the ongoing conflict \nin Yemen. Applicant\u2019s potential access to sensitive information could theoretically add \nrisk to his relatives living in or visiting Yemen. Yemen is an exceptionally dangerous \ncountry, and Applicant\u2019s father in prominent in Yemen. Foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or access to sensitive information by \nconsidering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant access to a \npublic trust position and access to sensitive information \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old manager and lead integration architect employed by a \ndefense contractor. From 2004 to 2006, he worked for the U.S. Government in Yemen \nas an accounting assistant. He studied English before coming to the United States. In \n2004, he emigrated from Yemen to the United States. He received a bachelors and \nmaster\u2019s degrees from a U.S. university. Applicant married a native-born U.S. citizen. His \neight-year-old daughter was born in the United States. In 2015, Applicant became a U.S. \ncitizen, and he swore an oath of allegiance to the United States. All of his property and \nfinancial interests are in the United States. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e referenced relatives not \nliving in Yemen, and those allegations are mitigated. \n \n\n \n13  \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence described him as conscientious, diligent, helpful, \nmotivated, and intelligent. His manager emphasized his trustworthiness, honesty, \ncommitment to his employer, and professionalism. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Yemen must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical situation \nand suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Yemen is a dangerous place \nbecause of violence from terrorists and the ongoing civil war. The Houthi-controlled \nYemen government does not fully comply with the rule of law or protect civil liberties in \nmany instances.  \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts with his family in Yemen. His father is a \nprominent citizen and resident of Yemen. He has seven siblings that are citizens and \nresidents of Yemen. His relationships with family in Yemen raise important unresolved \nforeign influence trustworthiness concerns.   \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson. Applicant failed to fully mitigate the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline B \n(foreign influence). \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.e.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n   \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 19, 2013, and again on June 5, 2018, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) \nversion of a Security Clearance Application. On March 19, 2019, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn an unsworn and undated statement, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) On \nJuly 22, 2019, pursuant to \u00b6 E.3.1.13 of the Directive, the Government amended the SOR \nby adding an additional allegation, designated as SOR \u00b6 1.h. A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 23, 2019, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on August 15, 2019. His response was due on September 14, 2019. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of October 16, 2019, no response had been \nreceived.  The case was assigned to me on October 16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.g.). He failed to answer the newly added allegation, and his silence is considered a \ndenial. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an aircraft mechanic with his current employer since September 2014. He previously \nserved in similar positions with other employers within the United States and overseas, \nincluding Iraq and Afghanistan. A 1997 high school graduate, Applicant received a \ntechnical certification in airframe and propulsion in 1999. He has never served with the \nU.S. military. He was determined eligible for a position of public trust in 2009 and 2012, \nand was granted a secret clearance in 2013. He was married in 2004. He has two \nchildren, born in 2002 and 2012.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated August 1, 2018); Item 9 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nJanuary 11, 2019); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated September 19, 2018); and \nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, undated).  \nOn January 20, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS). At that time, he was questioned about certain \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ndelinquent accounts, and he claimed that some of the debts listed in an earlier credit \nreport were inaccurate, and that his account issues had been resolved. (Item 5) With \nrespect to his most recent financial issues, Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to \nhis mother\u2019s 2016 hospitalization and death, especially when Medicare refused to cover \nsome of her expenses; his daughter\u2019s back surgery, leaving a bill of $300; a September \n2017 hurricane; and his wife\u2019s loss of employment due to the hurricane. (Item 6, at 5-6; \nItem 4, at 45) In order to resolve his mother\u2019s expenses, Applicant prioritized his bills. As \na result, some of his accounts became delinquent. In December 2016 or January 2017, \nin an effort to address his delinquent accounts, Applicant obtained a consolidation loan \nfrom a particular bank. He contended that certain identified accounts were resolved by \nthe funds he obtained by the loan. (Item 6, at 5) A review of Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit report \nreveals three separate accounts from that particular bank, but the one identified during \nhis interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \nreports a $17,340 high credit with a zero balance. The account was 120 days past due, \nand closed. (Item 8, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant identified a different account \nas the source of the funds. According to his 2018 credit report, that account has a $16,940 \nhigh credit and an unpaid balance of $17,386, of which $501 was past due. None of the \naccounts are reported in Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report.  \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$53,821. Five of the eight accounts are ones that Applicant contended he had resolved. \nThe SOR allegations are set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.: This is a student loan with an unpaid balance of $15,224 that was \ntransferred to another lender and assigned to the government. (Item 9, at 2-3; Item 8, at \n5, 7, and 10) During his September 2018 OPM interview, Applicant stated that he would \ncontact the U.S. Department of Education to determine who is servicing the loan in order \nto establish repayment arrangements. (Item 6, at 6) In his Answer to the SOR, he stated \nthat he was \u201ccurrently verifying the current lender.\u201d (Item 2) Over one year has passed \nsince Applicant made his statement to the OPM investigator, and he has not submitted \nany documents to reflect any actions that he may have taken over that period to resolve \nthe account. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not yet \nin the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.f.: These are a variety of credit cards, charge accounts, and \nunspecified types of accounts with unpaid or charged-off balances of $13,790, $2,416, \n$1,750, $833, and $499. (Item 8, at 8-9; Item 9, at 2-3; Item 6, at 2) Applicant contended \nthat these five accounts were paid and resolved by the funds in his consolidation loan. \n(Item 6, at 5-6; Item 2) He failed to submit any documentation such as statements from \nthe creditors agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a \nbank register, or receipts, to indicate that any payments had been made or the accounts \nresolved. In the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the accounts are not yet \nin the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g.: This is an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid balance of \n$2,293 that was charged off. (Item 8, at 9) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ncreditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon monthly $83 payments. \n(Item 2) He did not specify when those payments commenced, and he failed to submit \nany documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, \ncancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his \ncontention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor. \nIn the absence of such documentation, I conclude that the account is not yet in the \nprocess of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.: This is an automobile loan that was opened in December 2014 with a \n$27,842 high credit and an unpaid balance of $17,016 of which $988 was past due. \nMonthly payments were $673, and the account started becoming delinquent in June \n2018. (Item 9, at 1) Applicant did not address this debt. The account has not been \nresolved. \nIn January 2015, Applicant presented a financial disclosure report to DHS. In it, he \nestimated assets of $197,000, including one residence and four automobiles, and \nestimated $201,000 in liabilities. His total annual income was $65,000. He had $1,759 in \n\u201cselected monthly expenses.\u201d (Item 7) It is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresources may be because he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly \nexpenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending \nor savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. \nIn the absence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant had eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately $53,821. He \nadmitted that seven of those accounts were his responsibility, but failed to address the \neighth account. He claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in \ncurrent status.AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that \nApplicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and  AG \n\u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for \nseveral years, and in fact, incur a significant additional monthly obligation make it rather \neasy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like \nit has been for several years. Applicant has attempted to attribute his financial problems \nto his separation and divorce and having insufficient funds. He did not specify how those \nissues impacted his finances. Furthermore, he failed to explain why, during a period of \nclaimed insufficient funds, he purchased a third vehicle to go along with his other two cars \nand one motorcycle.  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his e-QIP in April 2018; underwent his OPM interview in June 2018; and the \nSOR was issued in May 2019. Each step of the security clearance review process placed \nhim on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. With one \nexception, Applicant did not contact his creditors either to seek repayment agreements, \nor to actually start making payments, until July 2019 \u2013 nearly two months after the SOR \nwas issued. His proven history of making payments reflects very modest solitary \npayments several creditors, as well as ignoring the remaining creditors.  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took some corrective actions with respect to some of his delinquent debts well \nafter he was interviewed by the OPM investigator. There are also substantial unverified \ncomments by Applicant that he resolved or started to resolve some delinquent accounts, \nbut he offered no documentation to support his contentions. His contentions regarding \nthe status of some accounts, and his unverified comments claiming that he had taken \ncertain actions, without documents, to support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-\nfaith actions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \nassociate systems administrator with his current employer since September 2016. He is \na 1996 high school graduate. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 1996, and \nhe remained on active duty, including service in both Iraq and Afghanistan, until he was \nhonorably retired in December 2016. He was treated for PTSD in 2014. He was granted \na secret clearance in 1996, and he reported that he was granted access to SCI in 2012.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant had a number of delinquent accounts that were ignored by him until \nat least July 2019 two months after the SOR was issued, and nearly a year after he was \ninterviewed by the OPM investigator. Rather than starting on resolving his delinquent \ndebts, in January 2019, he purchased his fourth vehicle, including three other cars and \none motorcycle. Applicant claimed that he had paid off some of the creditors, or entered \ninto repayment agreements with other creditors. However, with rare exceptions, because \nof his failure to submit documentation associated with his delinquent accounts, such as \nreceipts, cancelled checks, or bank account transactions, to support his contentions that \nsome accounts have been settled, paid off, or otherwise resolved; or that agreed \nsettlements have actually proceeded to resolution; or that payments have actually been \nmade to his creditors, it is difficult to assess the true situation, for we have mostly \nApplicant\u2019s unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he took certain actions with respect to his \ndelinquent debts, there is very little documentary evidence to indicate that many of those \naccounts have been addressed. He did submit documentation that he had made his first \nrather modest payments to some creditors in July 2019. Applicant\u2019s current track record \nis poor at best. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.l.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 7, 2017. On \nFebruary 19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines H and F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \non June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 18, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel amended the SOR on April 11, 2019, \nadding under Guideline H, an allegation of a positive drug test. Applicant answered the \n\n \n2 \n \namended SOR on May 14, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on July 18, 2019, and the hearing was convened on August 5, \n2019. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 with an exhibit list were admitted into \nevidence without objection. A Department Counsel discovery letter was marked as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) 1, and appended to the record. Applicant testified at the hearing, \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without \nobjection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit any documentary evidence \nin mitigation. He submitted several documents marked as AE D, and admitted into \nevidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on August 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old aircraft electronics maintenance technician, employed \nby a government contractor since April 2019. He graduated from high school in 2005, and \ncompleted some college credits. He is unmarried, and has two children (ages three and \nseven years old), one of whom lives with him. Applicant stated he has held a security \nclearance since 2007 while employed by other government contractors. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that in October 2016, Applicant used and \ntested positive for methamphetamine while cleared for access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges a mortgage foreclosure in 2016; a state child support \narrearage of $14,651; and four other collection accounts totaling over $4,000. Applicant \nadmitted the SOR allegations. \nIn October 2016, Applicant resigned from a position as a government contractor, \nstating in his SCA that \u201cit got real political\u201d and \u201cI was unhappy, was time to find something \nnew.\u201d (GE 1) In his personal subject interview, Applicant claimed he left the position \nbecause the \u201ccontract changed three times in the six years he was there,\u201d and he denied \nthat drug use while possessing a security clearance was the cause. (GE 2) However, in \ntestimony, Applicant admitted that he was going to be fired from his employment for failure \nto take a random urinalysis test. He claimed that he could not provide a sufficient amount \nof urine for the test, and it would be considered a failure to comply. He decided to resign \nto avoid a \u201cfalse positive\u201d test and resulting termination. (Tr. 38-40) He claimed it would \nbe a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d because his inability to provide a sample would be considered the \nsame as a positive test. He remained unemployed from October 2016 to December 2016, \nand lived using money withdrawn from a 401(k) retirement plan and help from his parents. \n(GE 2) \n \nApplicant claims that after he resigned from his job, he and his live-in girlfriend, the \nmother of his second child, attended a party where he smoked crystal methamphetamine \nwith her. He stated in his personal subject interview (PSI) that he used the illegal drug \nbecause he was \u201cleaving\u201d his job, was behind on his mortgage and threatened with \nforeclosure, and was paying child support arranges. He rationalized his surrender to peer \npressure by declaring \u201cwhy not, what else do I have to lose.\u201d (GE 2) The following day, \nApplicant argued with his girlfriend over finances. She reported his drug use the previous \nevening to her ex-husband, who in turn reported it to the state Child Protective Services \n\n \n3 \n \n(CPS). CPS investigators removed his child from the home, and requested Applicant and \nhis girlfriend submit to a drug test. Applicant refused, but his girlfriend tested positive for \nmethamphetamine. The following day, Applicant submitted a sample, which also tested \npositive for methamphetamine. Of note, in response to the Government\u2019s amended SOR \nallegation adding Applicant\u2019s October 2016 positive drug test, Applicant admitted the \nallegation but inexplicably claimed in his Answer that there is \u201cno evidence or proof of \nthis,\u201d despite admitting to a positive drug test in his SCA. (Amended SOR Answer and \nGE 1) Applicant admitted that he never weighed the risks of his one-time drug use, and \nthat it resulted in unexpected and disastrous consequences. He vowed to refrain from \nfurther illegal drug use. \n \nApplicant appeared in court for a custody hearing, and was ordered to attend \ncounseling and submit to weekly drug tests for one year. (GE 1) Applicant continued to \ncohabit with his girlfriend until at least May 2017 when he completed his SCA. (GE 1) He \ncompleted a year of negative drug tests and family counseling, and was able to recover \ncustody of his child. He claimed that some of the counseling included drug abuse issues. \n \nIn October 2016, Applicant was cited by state police for misdemeanor failure to \nregister a vehicle. He was required to appear in court, but he claimed that because he \nreceived notice of his child-support arrearage, lost his job, his child, and was about to \nlose his home, he forgot about the citation. A warrant was issued for his arrest. A similar \nincident occurred in December 2016, and a second warrant was issued. Applicant finally \nregistered his vehicle in February 2017, and in September 2017, borrowed money from \nhis parents to pay a $1,200 fine for the citations. These events were not alleged in the \nSOR. (GE 2) \n \nApplicant claimed that his mortgage became delinquent after he left his \nemployment in October 2016, however he testified that the mortgage account was current \nto November 2016. Of note, his credit report shows the last activity on the account was \nin June 2016. (GE3) He noted in his PSI that he was too embarrassed to contact the \ncreditor and did not have the funds to pay the mortgage and his child-support obligations, \nso he allowed the mortgage to go into foreclosure. In testimony, he claimed that he tried \nto file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but he did not have the requisite income. He also claimed \nthat he tried to refinance the mortgage, but he did not qualify. There is no evidence of a \ndeficiency balance owed. \n \nApplicant testified that his child-support obligation began with a judgment in June \n2015, and continued unpaid until September 2016 when his pay was garnished and his \ntax refunds were seized. Applicant has been making regular monthly payments since \nSeptember 2016. As of August 2019, he was in arrears for child support totaling $11,804, \nand owed a total of $13,213.  \n \n \nApplicant owes a debt to a phone company that has been placed in collection for \n$1,412. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) He testified that he disagreed with the amount of the debt and was \ntold by the company that it would be adjusted, but it was not. He eventually agreed with \nthe collection agent to pay, but he has not done so. The debt remains unpaid. Applicant \n\n \n4 \n \nowes medical debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.e. He testified that he has not investigated \nthe debts nor has he resolved them. Finally, Applicant owes a bank for overdraft charges \nand penalties incurred in early 2017. The debt has been placed in collection, and \nApplicant had not resolved it. He also testified that he is currently behind on his internet \nservice account, and has about $200 to $300 in available cash. In 2016, he withdrew \nabout $14,000 to $15,000 from his 401(k) retirement plan. He has not had credit \ncounseling. \n \n \nApplicant provided several character letters from his case worker, coworkers and \nfriends. They generally attest to his work ethic, honesty and trustworthiness. His case \nworker noted Applicant\u2019s behavioral changes after participating in services and \ncompleting a parenting course. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 25. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant admitted to using methamphetamine in October 2016 while being \ngranted security eligibility, and testing positive for the drug.  Disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6 25 (a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of an illegal drug, purportedly after he was unable to give a \ncomplete urine sample for an employer-mandated test, and testing positive after first \nrefusing a state-sponsored test, cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Applicant admitted to the SOR allegations, including use of an illegal \nsubstance while holding a security clearance. Although he claims this was a one-time \nincident, his explanation of the timing of his drug use and employer testing is not \nconvincing, and he continued to live with the person with whom he used the drug for a \nlengthy period of time.  \n \nAlthough Applicant has had family counseling that included some substance abuse \nissues, and he states that he has learned from his error in judgment, I am not convinced \nthat drug involvement is completely behind him. He has completed a year of drug testing \nwith negative results, however these tests were under the order and supervision of the \ncourt with the custody of his child at stake. He has not signed a statement of intent to \n\n \n7 \n \nabstain from future illegal drug use per AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). He has not shown evidence of \ncompletion of a drug evaluation or treatment program with a favorable prognosis, rather \nhe asks the Government to accept his word. Although Applicant claims that his use of \nmethamphetamine was a one-time incident, it would not have likely been discovered but \nfor his girlfriend\u2019s complaint. In addition, his explanation of the timing of his incomplete \nurine sample at work and claimed subsequent drug use with his girlfriend rings hollow. I \ncontinue to doubt Applicant\u2019s truthfulness, judgment, and willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. Applicant is entitled to credit for a year of negative drug tests, no longer \nliving with his girlfriend, and some counseling, but full mitigation credit does not apply in \nany particular area. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances may have suffered after leaving his employment and losing \ncustody of his child, but his employment was purportedly within his control, and his loss \nof custody resulted from his use of an illegal drug. Neither of these incidents are sufficient \nto warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(b). His financial delinquencies are a current and \ncontinuing matter. \n \nApplicant has not submitted sufficient evidence to mitigate the SOR debts or to \nshow that his financial problems are under control and will not recur. Applicant\u2019s behavior \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Although he is \nmaking payments on his child-support obligation, these payments were forced through a \njudgment and garnishment of his wages, and he remains significantly in arrears. The \ntiming of his first delinquent mortgage payment is questionable. Evidence exists to show \nthat it may have begun prior to his resignation, drug use, and loss of custody. His failure \nto address or resolve his mortgage and other delinquent debts is evidence of his lack of \nfinancial responsibility. \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial status raises significant doubts about his financial \nmanagement decisions and personal financial responsibility. I am not convinced he can \nmeet his current financial needs, and he has not shown a willingness or ability to resolve \nthe SOR debts. No mitigation fully applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines H and F, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s struggles to regain custody of his child, ongoing support obligations, negative \ndrug tests, and the support from his coworkers, friends, and case worker. However, I \nremain unconvinced of his financial responsibility, ability and willingness to meet his \nfinancial obligations, and willingness to follow rules prohibiting use of illegal drugs. \n\n \n9 \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 2.a through 2.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 19, 2018, Applicant owed medical collection debt totaling $9,215 on 14 accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n); a telephone debt in collection for $392 (SOR \u00b6 1.o); and a charged-off debt for $2,067 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). (Item 1.) When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant denied only the telephone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. He admitted the other debts, which he asserted were the result of illness when he was either not covered by medical insurance or when he had not met the yearly deductible under his medical insurance policy. (Item 2.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old high school graduate. He has been married to his second wife since March 1993, and has two children in their early 20s. Applicant completed some online coursework at a technical institute from June 2007 to December 2007, but earned no certificate. The institute has ceased operating. Applicant began working in the defense industry in January 2018. He had held a succession of jobs in the construction, utility, and telecommunications industries with some brief periods of unemployment from April 2016 to May 2016 after he resigned, and from March 2017 to July 2017 after he was involuntarily terminated from a job as a project manager for a construction company.

He took on new car loans for \n$35,386 and $40,707 in 2017 and $9,978 in 2018 that are being repaid, but concerns \npersist about his financial judgment, given his lack of progress on resolving his delinquent \ndebts. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn March 21, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On March 29, 2019, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of six exhibits (Items 1-6). On April 1, 2019, DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of \nreceipt. Applicant received the FORM on April 10, 2019, and he submitted a timely \nresponse to which the Government had no objections. On May 16, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with national security to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on May 21, 2019, \nand accepted Applicant\u2019s FORM response in the record as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 6 a summary report of a subject interview of \nApplicant conducted on August 6, 2018. The summary report was part of the DOD Report \nof Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD \npersonnel background report of investigation may be received in evidence and considered \nwith an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules \nof Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows: \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 6) is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can \ncomment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that \nthe report is unauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections are \nraised in your response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, \nthe Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections \nto the admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as \nevidence in your case. \n\n3 \n \n   \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel, and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary \nreport, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the report. He did not specifically object to the interview \nsummary in his rebuttal (AE A) to the FORM. He did state that \u201cthings are not reporting \ncorrectly,\u201d although it is unclear whether he was objecting to the statement or to credit \nentries on his credit reports. In the absence of any specific objections or indication that the \ninterview summary report contains inaccurate information, I accepted Item 6 in evidence, \nsubject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of December 19, 2018, Applicant owed \nmedical collection debt totaling $9,215 on 14 accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n); a telephone debt \nin collection for $392 (SOR \u00b6 1.o); and a charged-off debt for $2,067 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). (Item 1.) \nWhen he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant denied only the telephone debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.o. He admitted the other debts, which he asserted were the result of illness when \nhe was either not covered by medical insurance or when he had not met the yearly \ndeductible under his medical insurance policy. (Item 2.) \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), \nand AE A, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old high school graduate. He has been married to his second \nwife since March 1993, and has two children in their early 20s. Applicant completed some \nonline coursework at a technical institute from June 2007 to December 2007, but earned \nno certificate. The institute has ceased operating. Applicant began working in the defense \nindustry in January 2018. He had held a succession of jobs in the construction, utility, and \ntelecommunications industries with some brief periods of unemployment from April 2016 to \nMay 2016 after he resigned, and from March 2017 to July 2017 after he was involuntarily \nterminated from a job as a project manager for a construction company. (Items 3, 6.) \n \nOn February 9, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He listed vacations to the Caribbean \nin March 2014 and in August 2015 and a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct in \nAugust 2004. Regarding financial issues, Applicant disclosed a court judgment for $2,700 \nawarded a former landlord in January 2015 that was resolved in January 2016. He \n\n4 \n \nresponded negatively to an inquiry concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts \nin the last seven years. (Item 3.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 20, 2018, revealed a charged-off automobile \nloan for $807 with a $1,884 past-due balance (SOR \u00b6 1.p); a disputed insurance debt of \n$137 in collection since September 2015 (not alleged) and a $293 utility debt (not alleged, \nassigned for collection in July 2016. Additionally, medical debts were in collection totaling \n$7,748. The medical debts were placed for collection on various dates between June 2012 \nand December 2017. Applicant was disputing one of the medical debts, which had been \nplaced for collection in September 2012 for $980 (not alleged) and was reportedly still \nunpaid as of March 2018. A student loan charged off for $3,151 was in collection with a \n$4,899 balance (not alleged). Three student loan accounts were in collection for $7,748 \n(not alleged). A student loan obtained in October 2016 for $2,013 was charged off for $335 \nin February 2018 (not alleged). (Item 5.) \n \nOn August 6, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When given the opportunity to divulge \ninformation regarding any delinquent debts, Applicant volunteered no information. He was \nthen confronted with the adverse accounts on his credit record. He expressed his belief \nthat the medical collection debts were all incurred from emergency appointments, and that \nsome of the debts might be duplicate listings with different collection entities. He indicated \nthat he would make payments on the debts now that he had stable employment. Regarding \nthe delinquent student loans, Applicant advised that the debts were not behind more than \n90 days. Concerning the car loan that was past due for $1,884, Applicant indicated that he \nwas unaware of the debt, but surmised that it might be a medical debt from his issues in \nFebruary 2018 and March 2018. He described his financial situation as currently stable. \n(Item 6.) \n \nAs of December 2018, Applicant was legally liable on four car loans: a $40,707 car \nloan obtained in August 2017 (balance $37,422, $865 monthly payments); an $11,750 car \nloan obtained in December 2015 (balance $3,876, $394 monthly payments); a $35,386 car \nloan obtained in February 2017 (balance $28,503, $607 monthly payments); and a $9,978 \ncar loan obtained in October 2018 ($217 monthly payments). The car loans were being \nrepaid on time for the most part. He had made no payments toward the charged-off May \n2012 car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.p). The loan was listed as $2,067 past due, but with a balance of \n$807, the amount charged off on the loan. Several medical debts totaling $10,193 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.n and a $978 unalleged medical debt from May 2018) were reportedly in collection. \nAdditionally, a $392 telephone services debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o), a $1,420 debt (not alleged), and \na $137 insurance debt from July 2015 (not alleged) were reportedly also past due and in \ncollection. (Item 4.) \n \nOn March 19, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging $9,215 in \nmedical collection debt, the $392 telecommunications debt, and the May 2012 charged-off \ncar loan as a debt of $2,067. (Item 1.) In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the \ndebts but for the telephone debt, which he claimed was being reported erroneously \nbecause he was in good standing with the service provider. He expressed a mistaken belief \n\n5 \n \nthat the car loan was a medical debt. He explained that his medical debts were for \ntreatment for a potentially life-threatening condition when he was employed as a contactor \nand not covered by medical insurance or had not met his yearly deductible. Concerning his \nfailure to resolve the debts, Applicant stated: \n \nI have taken responsibility for these items and have made payments on \nmultiple past due bills. It is just taking time to catch them all up and certain \nentities would rather destroy or cause harm to people than work with them to \nresolve [the debts]. In some cases, a few of these bills went straight into \ncollection with a two-week time frame of not receiving a payment or me \nasking for time due to no monies coming in. \n \n \nApplicant added that he would not betray his country for some $11,000 of debt and \nthat denial of clearance eligibility would be a financial setback that would compromise his \nability to repay his debt obligations. (Item 2.) \n \n  \nThe Government posited in the FORM that Applicant had not acted responsibly to \nresolve his debts, citing his trips to the Caribbean and financing a car for approximately \n$40,000 in 2017 while some debts went unpaid. In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant \nindicated on April 15, 2019, that he has been \u201cmaking a valiant effort\u201d to resolve the issues \non his credit report in that in less than two years, he has made payments totaling $18,030 \nto his creditors. He contested the legitimacy only of the phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. He \nadded that some \u201cthings are not being reported correctly\u201d on his credit report; that creditors \nare slow to remove negative entries that have been resolved; and that some creditors are \nnot willing to accept affordable repayment arrangements and would rather cause harm by \nfiling for collection. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation showing that, in June 2009, he satisfied a $625 \njudgment for delinquent state taxes. In February 2017, he paid a $749 utility bill in \ncollection. In May 2017, he paid a $496 share-draft deficiency to a credit union. In \nNovember 2018, he apparently satisfied a charged-off credit card debt. He arranged in \nJanuary 2017 to repay $8,913 in student-loan collection debt at $184 a month. He \nsubmitted his spouse\u2019s credit report with handwritten entries noting calls to creditors and \napparently reflecting settlement amounts for some accounts on her credit. She paid $60 to \nresolve a wireless phone debt in her name in February 2017, and $124 on a credit card \naccount in May 2017. Applicant arranged to make a $375 payment on April 19, 2019, \ntoward a $780 debt in collection. (AE A.) Some of the documents show debts as paid but \nnot the amounts. However, his documentation does not establish that any of the debts that \nwere satisfied, settled, or are being repaid are those alleged in the SOR. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \n\n6 \n \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \n\n7 \n \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the available credit reports establish a record of \ndelinquency that triggers two disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Of the $11,674 in \ndelinquent debt alleged in the SOR, Applicant disputes only the $392 telecommunications \ndebt. That debt appears on his December 2018 credit report, and the Appeal Board has \nheld that credit reports are ordinary business records which are routinely accepted in \nDOHA proceedings, and Department Counsel is entitled to rely on the evidence in credit \nreports. In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he] is not responsible for the debt \nor that matters in mitigation apply (internal citation omitted). \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment that arise from his record of medical collection debts; the charged-off automobile \nloan from May 2012; and the telephone services debt in collection. Application of the \naforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20. Five of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some \nconsideration and could potentially apply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n8 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.p was charged off in May 2012, and some of the medical \ncollection debts were initially incurred several years ago, in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) and 2014 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g, and 1.k-1.l). However, no progress has been shown toward resolving \nthose debts. Even if the debts became delinquent several years ago, they are still \nconsidered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F \nmitigating conditions.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate \nsuch ongoing delinquency. The medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.h-1.j, and 1.n are more \nrecent in that they were all placed for collection in the last three years. They also remain \nunpaid.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that most of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nmedical. Non-discretionary medical debts do not carry the same financial judgment \nconcerns as consumer credit abuse. Applicant indicated that the debts were incurred when \nhe either lacked medical insurance or had not met his yearly deductibles when he had \ncoverage, although he provided no corroborating documentation and little detail about his \nmedical expenses or his income. Even if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in \nwhole or in part, due to circumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether \nApplicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR \nCase No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant \nmaintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. Applicant\u2019s evidence falls considerably short in that regard. During his \nAugust 2018 interview with an OPM investigator, Applicant did not deny the debts when he \nwas confronted, but he knew little about them. He speculated that they all stemmed from \n\n9 \n \nan emergency medical situation that occurred in February 2018 or March 2018. However, \navailable credit information indicates that most of the medical debts in collection were \nincurred before 2018, and that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p is a defaulted car loan and not a \nmedical debt. Applicant exhibits questionable financial judgment by failing to keep himself \napprised of his debt obligations. Moreover, after being placed on notice of the adverse \ncredit information during his August 2018 subject interview, Applicant took on a fourth car \nloan in October 2018 while making little effort to address the issues of security concern to \nthe DOD. \n \n \nIn rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation showing some effort to \nsatisfy or settle some debts, such as a tax judgment in 2009 and a utility debt in collection \nin February 2017. He arranged to make monthly payments toward a defaulted student \nloan. Yet, the payment records do not substantiate his claim that he paid $18,060 in less \nthan two years unless he is counting his considerable car loan payments. The Appeal \nBoard held in ISCR Case No. 07-06482, decided on May 21, 2008, that an applicant is not \nrequired to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts \npaid be those in the SOR. However, an applicant needs to show that he has a plan to \nresolve his debts and that he has taken significant steps to implement his plan. During his \nAugust 2018 interview, Applicant expressed a willingness and an ability to pay his past-due \ndebts. As of April 2019, Applicant has yet to resolve even the smallest of his medical debts \n($30) in collection. A promise to pay debts at some future date is not a substitute for a track \nrecord of timely payments. See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). Without some documented \nprogress toward resolving the debts in the SOR, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \nEven acknowledging that credit companies may be quick in turning delinquent debts over \nfor collection and slow in removing adverse credit entries after the debts are resolved, it \ndoes not relieve Applicant of his obligation to address his legitimate debts. \n \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 20(e) and Applicant\u2019s disputed liability for the telephone debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.o, there is no documentation in the record from which I can conclude that the debt \nis not valid. At a minimum, Applicant could have provided a letter from the provider \nindicating that his account is not overdue. He did not meet his burden of establishing AG \u00b6 \n20(e). Without any information about his household income and with only limited \ninformation about his household expenses (his credit reports show that his car payments \nalone exceed $2,000 a month), it is difficult to conclude that his financial problems are \nsafely behind him. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n\n10 \n \nApplicant indicates that he would not betray his country because of delinquent debt \nthat totals little more than $11,000. The concerns under Guideline F are broader than \nwhether he would deliberately compromise classified information, however. Between \nAugust 2017 and October 2018, he took on three car loans for $40,070, $35,386, and \n$9,978. It is difficult to justify such extensive car debt when medical creditors go unpaid. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an applicant \nmishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking security \nclearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009, citing \nAdams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Applicant\u2019s failure to give priority to resolving the \nfinancial issues of concern to the DOD raises considerable doubts about whether he can \nbe counted on to comply with security requirements. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a security \nclearance in the future. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nevidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his initial Answer to the SOR, Applicant failed to admit or deny any of the SOR allegations. Instead, he addressed the allegations and offered comments regarding each allegation. In his Supplemental Answer, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly all, or parts thereof, of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.i., 1.k. through 1.n., and 1.p. through 1.t.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an outside electrician with his current employer since May 2017. A 1998 high school graduate, Applicant received a technical certification in electrical business in 2016. He has never served with the U.S. military, and he never registered with the Selective Service System (SSS), claiming that he was not aware of the SSS until 2010, when he applied for a student loan. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was never married, and he has no children. Financial Considerations General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit Report, dated March 4, 2017); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated August 28, 20",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn an unsworn and undated statement, Applicant responded to the SOR. (Item 2)  \nOn June 14, 2019, he submitted a supplemental notarized statement, and he elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on \nSeptember 4, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on September 9, 2019. \nApplicant responded to the FORM by timely submitting a statement and associated \ndocuments, all of which were accepted without objection. The case was assigned to me \non September 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his initial Answer to the SOR, Applicant failed to admit or deny any of the SOR \nallegations. Instead, he addressed the allegations and offered comments regarding each \nallegation. In his Supplemental Answer, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, nearly \nall, or parts thereof, of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the \nSOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.i., 1.k. through 1.n., and 1.p. through 1.t.). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an outside electrician with his current employer since May 2017. A 1998 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received a technical certification in electrical business in 2016. He \nhas never served with the U.S. military, and he never registered with the Selective Service \nSystem (SSS), claiming that he was not aware of the SSS until 2010, when he applied \nfor a student loan.  He has never held a security clearance. Applicant was never married, \nand he has no children.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit \nReport, dated March 4, 2017); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated August 28, 2018); \nItem 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated August 28, 2019); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject \nInterview, dated March 30, 2018); Item 5 (Applicant\u2019s Response to the Interrogatories, \ndated February 22, 2019; Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, undated); Item 3 \n(Applicant\u2019s Supplemental Answer, dated June 14, 2019); and Applicant\u2019s Response to \nthe FORM, dated September 10, 2019. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nApplicant was unemployed over several periods during 2015, 2016, and 2017, with \nhis most recent period being from October 2016 until May 2017. During those periods, he \nsearched for new employment, and was supported either by unemployment \ncompensation, funds from his 401k, or by his parents. (Item 4, at 10-18; Item 5 (Enhanced \nSubject Interview), at 5) Applicant stated that he was in a relationship with someone who \nwas authorized to use \u201ca couple\u201d of his accounts, and some of his credit card debt was \nattributed to her. (Response to the FORM, at 1) During Applicant\u2019s periods of \nunemployment, he did not generate sufficient funds to maintain his financial accounts, \nand many of them became delinquent. Some of the delinquent accounts were charged \noff, and some were sold or transferred to debt purchasers. In addition, due to Applicant\u2019s \nself-described \u201claziness,\u201d as well as not having much income, Applicant failed to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, \nand 2016. (Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview), at 6)  \nWhen Applicant completed his November 2016 e-QIP, he acknowledged having \nsix delinquent accounts, as well as having failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for several tax years. (Item 4, at 29-37)  In March 2018, during his interview with \nan investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant \ndiscussed his unfiled tax returns, delinquent student loans, and one previously delinquent \ncredit card. It was only after he was confronted with additional delinquent accounts that \nhe shared the facts associated with those accounts.  \nThe SOR alleged six unfiled federal and state income tax returns as well as 17 \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $63,236. Applicant contended that some of \nthe SOR allegations duplicated other SOR allegations. Regarding those accounts for \nwhich he had not yet taken any steps to resolve, Applicant indicated that he would contact \nthe creditors to set up repayment plans. The SOR allegations are set forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.: This refers to Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal income tax return for \nthe tax year 2009, as required. In his e-QIP, during his OPM interview, and in his \nResponse to the Interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that he did not file the subject \nincome tax return. (Item 4, at 29; Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview), at 6); Item 5 \n(Response to the Interrogatories), at 13) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nacknowledged that he could not confirm the status of the filing of the income tax return. \n(Item 2, at 1) In his Supplemental Answer to the SOR, he contended that the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) had no record of him not filing an income tax return for the tax \nyear 2009. (Item 3, at 1) However, the IRS acknowledged that a federal income tax return \nfor the tax year 2009 was filed on August 4, 2010, and processed on August 23, 2010. \n(Item 5 (IRS Account Transcript, dated March 17, 2019) That Account Transcript was \nfurnished to DOHA on February 22, 2019, nearly two months before the SOR was issued. \nThe allegation has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: This refers to Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. In his Supplemental Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had failed to timely file those federal income tax \nreturns (Item 3, at 1), but noted that had recently done so. The IRS confirmed that with \nrespect to the tax year 2010, as of March 17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but a \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ntax return was received by the IRS on April 29, 2019; for the tax year 2011, as of March \n17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but a tax return was received by the IRS on April \n29, 2019; for the tax year 2012, as of March 17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but \na tax return was received by the IRS on April 29, 2019; for the tax year 2015, as of March \n17, 2019, no such return had been filed, but a tax return was received by the IRS on April \n29, 2019; and for the tax year 2016, as of March 17, 2019, no such return had been filed, \nbut a tax return was received by the IRS on April 29, 2019. (Item 5 (Account Transcripts \nattached to Response to Interrogatories); Item 3 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns) \nThere is a legal requirement to file a federal income tax return, and it is based upon \nan individual\u2019s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined, \nunder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, that there is an \nobligation to so file, the following applies: \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or \nrequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make \na return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to \npay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or \nsupply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, \nshall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than \n$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more \nthan 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of \nany person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, \nthis section shall not apply to such person with respect to such failure if \nthere is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such \nfailure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the \nfirst sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \n\"misdemeanor\" and \"5 years\" for \"1 year.\" \nThere is no evidence that Applicant made any efforts to contact the IRS until March \n17, 2019 \u2013 nearly one year after his OPM interview; or to file his multi-year delinquent \nfederal tax returns until April 29, 2019 \u2013 over one year after his OPM interview, and two \nweeks after the SOR was issued. While the federal income tax returns have now been \nfiled, none of them were timely filed as required by law. The issues regarding the federal \nincome tax returns have not been resolved. \n SOR \u00b6 1.c.: This refers to Applicant\u2019s failure to file his state income tax returns for \nthe tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. In his Supplemental Answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted that he had failed to timely file those state income tax returns \n(Item 3, at 1), but noted that had recently done so. The state department of revenue \nservices confirmed that with respect to the tax year 2010, a tax return was received on \nApril 30, 2019; for the tax year 2011, a tax return was received on April 30, 2019; for the \ntax year 2012, a tax return was received on April 30, 2019; for the tax year 2015, a tax \nreturn was received on April 30, 2019; and for the tax year 2016, a tax return was received \non April 30, 2019. (Item 3 (State Individual Tax Returns)) \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant made any efforts to file his multi-year \ndelinquent state tax returns until April 30, 2019 \u2013 all one year after the OPM interview and \ntwo weeks after the SOR was issued. While the state income tax returns have now been \nfiled, none of them were timely filed as required by law. The issues regarding the state \nincome tax returns have not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $22,507 credit limit \nand an unpaid balance of $21,192 (Item 7, at 1; Item 8, at 6) Applicant admitted that he \nis indebted to the creditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon \nunspecified payments to the creditor since October 2017. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) He \nfailed to submit any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a \nrepayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, \nto support his contention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments \nto the creditor. In the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account \nhas not been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.n., and 1.q.: These are three student-loan accounts with unpaid \nbalances of $5,410, $1,319, and $867 that were assigned to the Government. (Item 7, at \n2-3) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the creditor, but contended that he has been \nmaking agreed-upon unspecified payments to the creditor on all three accounts since \nOctober 2018. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) He failed to submit any documentation, such as \na statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of \nmoney orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his contention that he has an \nagreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor. However, while those \nbalances and the status of the accounts reported in Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit report are as \nalleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report reflects that Applicant \u201cpays account \nas agreed.\u201d (Item 6, at 3-4) Accordingly, I conclude that the accounts are in the process \nof being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.s.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a high credit \nof $5,325 that was charged off in January 2017. The account was sold or transferred to \none collection agent and subsequently sold to another debt purchaser. Applicant\u2019s 2018 \ncredit report indicates that the unpaid balance was $5,410, and his 2019 credit report \nreflects an unpaid balance of $4,797. (Item 8, at 6; Item 7, at 2; Item 6, at 3) Applicant \nadmitted that he was indebted to the creditor, erroneously believing that there were two \nseparate accounts, but contended that he has been making unspecified payments on the \ntwo accounts as agreed since December 2017. (Item 2, at 1-2; Item 3, at 1-2) The current \nowner of the account(s) submitted a payment history supporting Applicant\u2019s contention \nthat payments have been routinely been made since December 2017, initially starting \nwith $30 payments, and increasing over time to $34 payments. As of April 5, 2019, \nApplicant had made a total of $443 in payments on the account. ((Item 2 (Letter and \nAccount Ledger, dated May 2, 2019)) Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report reflects that his last \npayment was made in June 2019. (Item 6, at 3) Accordingly, I conclude that the account(s) \nis in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g.: This is a credit-card account with a $6,250 credit limit and an unpaid \nbalance of $4,334 that was charged off. (Item 8, at 7; Item 7, at 2) Applicant admitted that \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nhe was indebted to the creditor, but contended that he had settled the account for an \nunspecified sum and resolved it in July 2018. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) been making \nagreed-upon unspecified payments to the creditor since October 2017. (Item 2, at 1; Item \n3, at 1) He failed to submit any documentation, such as a statement from the creditor \nagreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, \nor receipts, to support his contention that he had an agreement and that he made any \nrequired payments to the creditor. However, while the status of the account reported in \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 credit report are as alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report \nreflects that the account was \u201cpaid for less than full balance,\u201d and it was considered \u201cpaid \nand closed.\u201d (Item 6, at 5) Accordingly, I conclude that the account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $4,000 credit limit. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit report reflects that there was a past-due balance of $4,052 \nand an unspecified amount had been charged off, his 2019 credit report reflects that \n$4,277 had been charged off. (Item 7, at 2; Item 6, at 2) was a past-due balance of $4,052 \nand an unspecified amount had been charged off, his 2019 credit report reflects that \n$4,277 had been charged off. Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but \ncontended that he has been making unspecified payments on the account as agreed \nsince November 2017. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) The collection agent for the account \nsubmitted a payment history supporting Applicant\u2019s contention that payments have been \nroutinely been made since November 2017, initially starting with $30 payments, and \nincreasing over time to $33 payments. As of April 15, 2019, Applicant had made a total \nof $516 in payments on the account. ((Item 2 (Letter and Account Ledger, dated May 2, \n2019)) Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report reflects that his last payment was made in August \n2019. (Item 6, at 2) Accordingly, I conclude that the account is in the process of being \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $2,150 credit limit, and \n$2,810 charged off and purchased by another lender. (Item 7, at 2; Item 6, at 2; Item 8, \nat 5) Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but contended that he has \nbeen making unspecified payments on the account as agreed since March 2019. (Item 2, \nat 1; Item 3, at 1) The collection agent for the account submitted a payment history \npartially supporting Applicant\u2019s contention that payments have been routinely been made, \nbut the commencement date was in December 2018, with $15 payments. As of April 30, \n2019, Applicant had made a total of $75 in payments on the account. ((Item 2 (Letter and \nAccount Ledger, dated April 30, 2019)) Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report reflects that his last \npayment was made in July 2019. (Item 6, at 3) Accordingly, I conclude that the account \nis in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j. and 1.t.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,900 credit \nlimit and past-due and unpaid balance of $2,280 that was transferred to or purchased by \nanother lender. (Item 7, at 4; Item 6, at 7; Item 8, at 9) Applicant admitted that he was \nindebted to the creditor, but contended that the two separate listings in the credit reports \nand the two separate allegations in the SOR referred to the same account, a contention \nthat is correct. His most recent statement claimed that he had written to the original \ncreditor to request payment arrangements. (Item 2, at 1-2; Item 3, at 1-2) He failed to \nsubmit a copy of his letter to the creditor requesting a repayment plan. Applicant did not \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nclaim to have made any payments on the account since it was transferred in 2013. \nAccordingly, in the absence of necessary documentation, I conclude that the account has \nnot been resolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $1,500 credit limit and \na past-due and unpaid balance of $1,941. On an unspecified date, $1,462 was charged \noff. (Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 8; Item 6, at 6) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the \ncreditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified payments to \nthe creditor since February 2018. (Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 1) He failed to submit any \ndocumentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, \ncancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his \ncontention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor. \nIn the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account has not been \nresolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,600 credit limit and a \npast-due and unpaid balance of $1,814 that was charged off. (Item 8, at 5; Item 6, at 4) \nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but contended that he had settled \nthe account for an unspecified sum and resolved it in March 2019. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3, \nat 1) On April 30, 2019, the collection agent for the account submitted a statement that \nthe account had been resolved and closed. ((Item 2 (Letter, dated April 30, 2019)) \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 credit report notes that the account was paid for less than full balance \nin March 2019 \u2013 before the SOR was issued. (Item 6, at 4) The letter from the creditor \nwas attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR. The account has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $1,000 credit limit \nand a past-due and unpaid balance of $1,355. On an unspecified date, an unspecified \namount was charged off. (Item 7, at 2) Applicant admitted that he is indebted to the \ncreditor, but contended that he has been making agreed-upon unspecified payments to \nthe creditor since May 2019. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3, at 1) He failed to submit any \ndocumentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, \ncancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his \ncontention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor. \nIn the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account has not been \nresolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o. and 1.r.: This is a bank-issued charge account with a $1,160 credit \nlimit and an unpaid balance of $1,074. In February 2017, $1,112 was charged off. The \naccount was transferred to or purchased by another lender. (Item 7, at 2-3; Item 6, at 7; \nItem 8, at 5, 11) Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but contended \nthat the two separate listings in the credit reports and the two separate allegations in the \nSOR referred to the same account, a contention that is correct. His most recent statement \nclaimed that he had made unspecified payment arrangements with the original creditor \nwith the initial payment made in May 2019. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3, at 2) He failed to submit \nany documentation, such as a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, \ncancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his \ncontention that he has an agreement and that he is making any payments to the creditor. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nIn the absence of such documentation, I must conclude that the account has not been \nresolved, and is not yet in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p.: This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $2,000 credit limit and \na past-due and unpaid balance of $919. On an unspecified date, $2,119 was charged off. \n(Item 7, at 3; Item 6, at 4) Applicant admitted that he was indebted to the creditor, but \ncontended that he had settled the account for an unspecified sum and resolved it in \nFebruary 2019. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3, at 1) He failed to submit any documentation, such \nas a statement from the creditor agreeing to a repayment plan, cancelled checks, copies \nof money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to support his contention that he had an \nagreement and that he made any payments to the creditor. Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report \nnotes that the account was paid off in February 2019 \u2013 before the SOR was issued. (Item \n6, at 4) The account has been resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s income has been relatively modest over the years. According to his \nfederal income tax forms or the IRS Account Transcripts he furnished, his approximate \nadjusted gross income has been as follows: 2010: $31,000; 2011: $33,000; 2012: \n$34,000; 2013: $36,000; 2014: $36,000; 2015: $28,000; 2016: $39,000; 2017: $21,000; \nand 2018: $51,000. It is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be \nbecause he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any \nmonthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is \nno evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe SOR alleged six unfiled federal and state income tax returns as well as 17 \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $63,236. Applicant contended that some of \nthe SOR allegations duplicated other SOR allegations, and his contentions were correct. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016, AG \u00b6 19(f) has been \nestablished. With respect to the allegation that he had not timely filed his federal income \ntax return for the tax year 2009, AG \u00b6 19(f) has not been established. With respect to his \nfailure to satisfy his various delinquent debts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts \nregardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g) minimally apply, but none of the other conditions \napply. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing financial difficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his \ndelinquent accounts for several years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not \ninfrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. \nApplicant has attempted to attribute his financial problems to his periods of \nunemployment; being in a relationship with someone who was authorized to use \u201ca \ncouple\u201d of his accounts; and having insufficient funds. He did not specify how those issues \nimpacted his finances. Due to Applicant\u2019s self-described \u201claziness,\u201d as well as not having \nmuch income, he failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for the tax years \n2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016.  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his e-QIP in November 2016; underwent his OPM interview in March 2018; \nresponded to interrogatories in February 2019; and the SOR was issued in April 2019. \nEach step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. With respect to his delinquent debts, \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \naccording to Applicant, only three of those debts were addressed in 2017, after the e-QIP \nwas completed and before he met with the OPM investigator. Eight other delinquent debts \nwere reportedly addressed after that OPM interview. With respect to his unfiled federal \nand state income tax returns, Applicant did not contact the IRS until March 2019, and he \nfailed to file those delinquent returns until April 29-30, 2019 \u2013 approximately three weeks \nafter the SOR was issued. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is evidence, supported by documentation, that \nApplicant took some good-faith corrective actions with respect to his delinquent debts \nbefore he was interviewed by the OPM investigator. There are also substantial unverified \ncomments by Applicant that he resolved or started to resolve some delinquent accounts, \nbut he offered no documentation to support his contentions. His contentions regarding \nthe status of some accounts, and his unverified comments claiming that he had taken \ncertain actions, without documents, to support his claims, are insufficient to reflect good-\nfaith actions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an \noutside electrician with his current employer since May 2017. A 1998 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received a technical certification in electrical business in 2016. \nApplicant made a few verified modest payments on some of his delinquent accounts, \ngenerally commencing in late 2017. Applicant contended that some of the SOR \nallegations duplicated other SOR allegations, and his contentions were correct. He finally \nfiled his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, \n2015, and 2016 on April 29-30, 2019 \u2013 approximately three weeks after the SOR was \nissued. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the \ntax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 until April 29-30, 2019. He also had a \nnumber of delinquent accounts that were ignored by him until at least 2017. Applicant \nclaimed that he had paid off some of the creditors, or entered into repayment agreements \nwith other creditors. However, with rare exceptions, because of his failure to submit \ndocumentation associated with his delinquent accounts, such as receipts, cancelled \nchecks, or bank account transactions, to support his contentions that some accounts have \nbeen settled, paid off, or otherwise resolved; or that agreed settlements have actually \nproceeded to resolution; or that payments have actually been made to his creditors, it is \ndifficult to assess the true situation, for we have mostly Applicant\u2019s unverified comments \nclaiming that he had taken certain actions.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he took certain actions with respect to his \ndelinquent debts, there is very little documentary evidence to indicate that many of those \naccounts have been addressed. He finally filed his delinquent income tax returns after he \nreceived the SOR. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor to fair at best. Overall, the \nevidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, \nApp. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.f. through 1.i., \n1.l., and 1.p.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.e., \n1.j., 1.k., 1.m. through 1.o.,  \nand 1.q.: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r.:  \n \n \nDuplicates subparagraph 1.o. \nSubparagraph 1.s.:  \n \n \nDuplicates subparagraph 1.f. \nSubparagraph 1.t.:  \n \n \nDuplicates subparagraph 1.j. \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 26, \n2016. On March 18, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 11, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On June 6, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 3, and AN I. He was given an opportunity to \nsubmit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \n\n \n2 \n \nJune 25, 2019, and did not respond. Item 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items 2 \nand 3 are admitted into evidence. Item AN I contains the Government\u2019s Administrative \nNotice request, which I have addressed below. The case was assigned to me on August \n29, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 1), his \nSCA (Item 2), and a summary of his security clearance interview (SI) (Item 3). Item 3 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Item 3. In a section entitled \u201cNOTICE TO \nAPPLICANT,\u201d the Government notified Applicant of his right to object to the \nadmissibility of Item 3 on the ground that it was not authenticated. In that section, \nApplicant was also notified that if he did not raise any objection to Item 3 in his response \nto the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection, and that Item 3 could be considered as evidence in his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM, which included a copy of Item 3. He did not \nrespond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item 3.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 55, is married with two children, ages 18 and 16. He is a Chinese \ncitizen by birth. He entered the United States in 1993, and became a U.S. citizen in \n2008. His wife of 26 years, also born in China, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Their \nchildren are U.S. citizens by birth. He received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from \nChinese universities in 1985 and 1988, and his doctorate from a U.S. university in 1997. \nApplicant has been employed as an engineer by a U.S. manufacturer and service \nprovider for jet engines since 2001. This is his first application for a DOD security \nclearance. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, age 82, is a resident and citizen of China (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His \nmother is deceased. She worked for a local government\u2019s \u201cclinic service\u201d and his father, \nwho retired more than 23 years ago, worked for that same local government\u2019s \u201chealth \nand family planning commission.\u201d Neither their job positions nor the nature of their work \nwas specified in the record. Applicant communicates with his father weekly by \ntelephone, and in person when he visits China. (Item 2 at 17-20, Item 3 at 6) \n \nApplicant has one sibling, a 52-year-old sister, who is a citizen and resident of \nChina (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She is employed as a researcher of Chinese medicine by a Chinese \nuniversity. He communicates with his sister telephonically and electronically on a \nmonthly basis, and in person when he visits China. Her marital and family status were \nnot specified in the record. (Item 2 at 20-21; Item 3 at 6) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law (MIL), age 81, and father-in law (FIL), age 85, are \ncitizens and residents of China (SOR \u00b6 1.c). His MIL, who retired more than 24 years \nago, was employed by a Chinese commercial and industrial bank. His FIL, who retired \nmore than 23 years ago, was employed as a \u201cvice chair\u201d of a local government. Neither \n\n \n3 \n \nhis MIL\u2019s job position nor the nature of her and her husband\u2019s work was specified in the \nrecord. Applicant communicates with them telephonically (and also electronically with \nhis FIL) on a monthly basis, and in person when he visits China. (Item 2 at 21-24; Item 3 \nat 6-7) \n \nAfter becoming a naturalized citizen, Applicant travelled to China to visit his \nfamily in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2016 (as of 2017). The record is silent as to how Applicant\u2019s \nfather and parents-in-law are financially supported. Applicant reported that he gave both \nsets of parents approximately $1,000 to $2,000 during each of his last four to five visits \nto China. He referred to those sums as gifts, which he provided due to a Chinese \ntradition of supporting parents once a child reaches adulthood. (Item 2 at 27-28, 32-34, \n41-42; Item 3 at 4 and 7)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother (BIL) and his BIL\u2019s wife (SIL) are citizens of China who \nhave resided in the United Kingdom (UK) for a period not specified in the record. \nApplicant communicates with them in person approximately every five years. He last \nvisited the UK in 2010, and his BIL last visited the United States in 2011 (as of 2017). \nHis SIL, age 51, is not employed outside the home. His BIL, age 52, is employed by a \nBritish-Dutch consumer goods company with no government affiliation. Neither his job \nposition nor the nature of his work was specified in the record. Applicant averred that he \nonly communicates with them when he sees them in person. While the record indicated \nthat they have one or more children, no other information was provided about them. \n(Item 3 at 8 and 9) \n \nApplicant previously maintained contact with a classmate from the Chinese \nuniversity where he obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree, who is a citizen and resident of \nChina. From approximately 1982 or 1983 through 2009, they had in-person contact \napproximately once every few years during his visits to China. They have not had \ncontact since 2009 due to Applicant\u2019s family members taking up all of his time when he \nvisits China. While Applicant stated that his classmate\u2019s employer was unknown, he \nasserted that the friend had no affiliation with a foreign government, military, security, \ndefense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence service. (Item 3 at 5) \n \nApplicant has owned his home since 2002. Neither he nor his wife and children \nmaintain any foreign financial interests. Applicant reported that none of his family \nmembers who reside in China have ties to the Chinese military or government agencies \nwhich involve technologies related to Applicant\u2019s employment. The record did not \nspecify how often or by what means Applicant\u2019s wife has contact with her family. (Items \n1 and 2) \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant declared that he wants \u201cto make contributions to \nthis great nation I love so dearly, and for which I chose to live [sic] rest of my life and for \nwhich I chose to raise my children so they can achieve their own American dreams.\u201d \nWithout providing any specifics, he claimed that he had been \u201cin good standing\u201d during \nall the years that he has lived in the United States. He also argued that his security \nclearance should be granted because \u201cmany\u201d of his work colleagues \u201cwith \nbackground[s] similar\u201d to his who have relatives in China have been granted one. He \n\n \n4 \n \nalso contended that his case is \u201cno difference [sic]\u201d to theirs and that he should be \n\u201ctreated the same way as them.\u201d He did not specify any other details about those cases. \n \nAdministrative Notice (China) \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the U.S. Government\u2019s pronouncements \nconcerning China, as outlined in Item AN I and the documents appended thereto, \nincluding the following: \n \n\uf0b7 China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Community Party \n(CCP) is the paramount authority. CCP members hold almost all top \ngovernment and security apparatus positions.  \n \n\uf0b7 China commits significant human rights abuses against it citizens, \nincluding, but not limited to, arbitrary or unlawful killings, forced \ndisappearances, torture, arbitrary detention, harsh and life-threatening \nprison \nand \ndetention \nconditions, \npolitical \nprisoners, \narbitrary \ninterference with privacy, inability of citizens to choose their \ngovernment, and corruption. \n \n\uf0b7 China has long targeted the United States with intelligence collections \noperations, but reporting of Chinese espionage has increased \nsignificantly in recent years. Among the most serious threats are \nChina\u2019s efforts at cyber and human infiltration of U.S. national security \norganizations. \n \n\uf0b7 China presents a persistent cyber-espionage threat and a growing \ncyber-attack threat to U.S. core military and critical infrastructure \nsystems. China remains the most active strategic competitor \nresponsible for cyberespionage against the U.S. Government.  \n \n\uf0b7 China\u2019s pursuit of intellectual property, sensitive research and \ndevelopment plans, and U.S. person data, remains a significant threat \nto the U.S. Government. \n \n\uf0b7 Most Chinese cyber operations against U.S. private industry that have \nbeen detected are focused on cleared defense contractors or IT and \ncommunications \nfirms \nwhose \nproducts \nand \nservices \nsupport \ngovernment and private sector networks worldwide. \n \n\uf0b7 In 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted three former U.S. \nintelligence officers who either pled guilty or were found guilty of \nparticipating in espionage and other crimes for agents of the Chinese \nintelligence service. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at \n3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is set out in AG \u00b6 6, \nas follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe following are potentially relevant disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct ties to his father, sister, and parents-in-law establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b). His indirect ties to his parents-in-law through his wife establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), and 7(e). Because ties to Applicant\u2019s BIL, SIL, and university classmate were not \nalleged in the SOR, I will consider them only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-\n\n \n7 \n \nperson concept. A heightened risk is associated with the Chinese government because \nit conducts espionage against the United States and commits serious human rights \nabuses against its citizens. Applicant bears the burden of persuasion to mitigate these \nconcerns. ISCR Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2000). Because China is \nhostile to the United States, his burden is \u201cvery heavy\u201d to show that neither he nor his \nfamily members are subject to influence by China. ISCR Case No. 06-17838 (App. Bd. \nJan 28, 2008). \n \nApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but \nmerely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with \nchoices that could be important to a loved one, such as a family member. ISCR Case \nNo. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). Family relationships can involve matters of \ninfluence or obligation. ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003). Moreover, \nthe potential exists for pressure to be placed on the applicant\u2019s in-laws that could then \nbe extended to the applicant through the applicant\u2019s spouse. ISCR Case No. 03-24144 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005).  \n \nThe following are potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant maintains strong familial ties with his father, sister, and in-laws (directly \nand through his wife). Given the absence of details in the record about the positions that \nApplicant\u2019s parents and FIL held with local governments in China, or whether they \nreceive a pension from the Chinese government, I do not find sufficient evidence to \nconclude that their positions, from which they have long retired, present a current \nsecurity concern. While it has not been established that any of his family have security-\nsignificant affiliations with the Chinese government, there remains a heightened risk \nassociated with China regardless of any such affiliations. Under these circumstances, I \ncannot conclude that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of his family and that of the United States, or that \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant has met his heavy burden to mitigate the Guideline B concern. AG \u00b6 8(a) is \nnot established. \n \nApplicant has strong ties to the United States. He and his wife chose to build \ntheir life in the United States 26 years ago. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his \nchildren are U.S. citizens by birth. He received his postgraduate degree from a U.S. \nuniversity, has been employed by the same U.S. company for 18 years, and has owned \na home in the United States for 17 years. However, the record contains insufficient facts \nto overcome the equally strong ties that he has to his father, sister, and in-laws (directly \nand through his wife), who are vulnerable to a foreign government known to conduct \nespionage against the United States and commit serious human rights violations \nagainst its citizens. Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude that Applicant could \nbe expected resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s familial relationships are casual; nor is his contact with them \ninfrequent. While their contact has not been frequent in 10 years, the close friendship \nthat he maintained with his university classmate for at least 26 years cannot be \nconsidered casual. There remains a potential risk for foreign influence or exploitation \ngiven the length and closeness of their friendship in the past. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not \nestablished. \n \nI want to address Applicant\u2019s contention that his case is analogous to that of his \ncolleagues who have been granted security clearances. First, pursuant to the Directive, \n\u201c[t]he adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweighing of a number of variables of an individual's life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. . . .\u201d (Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2 \n(a)); and \u201c[e]ach case must be judged on its own merits . . .\u201d (Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2 (b)). \nMoreover, Applicant did not provide details about the alleged analogous cases to \nestablish that they addressed identical issues and facts. He also failed to demonstrate \nthat those cases relied on reasoning or analysis that can be applied to the facts and \ncircumstances of his case. ISCR Case No. 03-26176 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2005). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole-\nperson concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must \nevaluate an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of \nthe Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. This analysis requires individualized \nconsideration of the facts and circumstances of each case, and the administrative judge \ncannot broadly apply the same conclusions from one case to another. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I weighed the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluated all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person and the heightened risk associated with China. Applicant has not \nmitigated his familial ties to citizens and residents of China. Accordingly, I conclude that \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 20, 2018. \nOn March 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 19, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

He remarried in October \n2014, and his spouse has eight children from her previous marriage. One of his children \nlives with him, and one child lives with his former spouse to which he pays child support. \nHe served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from 2001 until 2014. He was \ndischarged in April 2016 with a general discharge under honorable conditions. He \nremained unemployed from April to August 2016 after being discharged from active duty. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has over $35,000 in delinquent debts, and that he \nfailed to file his 2016 federal income tax return when due. Applicant admitted the \nallegations with the exception of a small medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He provided \nexplanations in his Answer to the SOR.  \n \nApplicant failed to file his 2016 federal income tax return because he claimed that \nhe was unable to access his W-2 form from his military employer. (SOR \u00b6 1.m) He claimed \nhe could not access his online pay account after he was discharged from the Marine \nCorps in 2016, and so was unable to file his tax return. Applicant submitted into evidence, \nan unsigned 2016 Form 1040A federal income tax return after obtaining his W-2 from the \nDefense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) in 2019, and he claimed that he \nsubmitted the return two weeks before his hearing in this case. Department Counsel \nobjected to admission of the tax return because it was undated and unsigned, and there \nwas no documentary evidence showing that it was filed with the IRS. At the hearing, I \ndiscussed with Applicant the importance of providing documentary evidence that the tax \nreturn was actually filed, however no such evidence was submitted in his post-hearing \nsubmission. \n \nThree of the largest SOR debts are collection or charged-off accounts owed on \nvarious credit cards and a car loan, totaling over $33,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, c, and g) \nApplicant testified that he stopped payments on a car loan identified in SOR \u00b6 1.a, in June \n2016, although his credit report shows it was June 2017. The account was charged off in \nJanuary 2018 for $18,147. The car was not repossessed, and Applicant still has the \nvehicle. He stated that he tried to make payment arrangements in 2018, and paid $3,269 \nas the first of four installments toward the debt, but he did not have the money to continue \npayments under the plan. In a post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that he \n\n \n3 \n \ncontacted the creditor but he could not settle the account but he could continue to make \npayments. No evidence of a payment plan or continued payments under the old plan was \nsubmitted. This debt remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a delinquent military retail store credit card account totaling $10,089. \nThe account became delinquent in March 2016, and transferred to collections. The \ncreditor garnished Applicant\u2019s wages and intercepted his 2018 tax refund. Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 2019 credit report shows the account remains past-due for $8,813. In his post-\nhearing submission, Applicant stated that he agreed to make additional $250 monthly \npayments and provided a preauthorized schedule for $250 monthly payments beginning \nin October 2019 and ending in July 2022. Of note, the account numbers on the payment \nplan do not correspond to the delinquent account reported on his credit report. This debt \nremains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card account for $4,307 that became delinquent in October \n2013, transferred to collections, and charged off. He testified that he made no further \npayments since then, and has had no further contact with the creditor. In his post-hearing \nsubmission, Applicant stated that he contacted the creditor and intends to make monthly \npayments of $216 going forward. He provided a debit receipt showing a $216 payment to \nthe creditor on September 17, 2019. No repayment agreement or plan with the creditor \nwas submitted. This debt remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a military base housing account that became delinquent for $1,286 \nin April 2016. The account remained unresolved until Applicant contacted the creditor \nafter the hearing. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant stated that he contacted the \ncreditor and agreed to pay $150 per month. He provided a debit receipt showing a \npayment for $150 on September 17, 2019. No repayment agreement or plan with the \ncreditor was submitted. This debt remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a delinquent cable service provider account from 2016, referred to \ncollection in 2018, for $197. Applicant testified that he paid the debt, and provided a \ndocument showing a payment of $99 in August 2018. The account no longer appears on \nhis credit report. This debt is resolved. \n \nFour small medical debts were alleged in the SOR, totaling $390. SOR \u00b6 1.f is an \naccount with an unknown medical creditor. Applicant denied knowledge of the account, \nand there is insufficient evidence in the record to confirm the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.j is a $134 \nmedical collection by a known collection agent. Applicant is unaware of the account, but \nhas not contacted the creditor or attempted to resolve it. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l are medical \ncollection accounts that Applicant paid in July 2018, and are resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a bank credit card account that became delinquent in 2013, for \n$3,746. Applicant has not made a payment since 2013 on the account, and it remains \nunresolved. SOR \u00b6 1.h is a delinquent cable service provider account for $857. Applicant \nmade a $263 payment toward this debt in April 2019, but continues to owe about $602. \nHe has not provided a plan to resolve this debt. SOR \u00b6 1.i is an insurance company debt \n\n \n4 \n \nfor $140 that was referred to collections. Applicant paid $145 to resolve this debt in April \n2019. \n \n Applicant\u2019s supervisor and coworker attested to his good work performance and \nreliability. They believe he is an honest and respectful leader in the workplace. Applicant \nacknowledges the mistakes he has made in the past, and noted his efforts to resolve his \ndebts. He attributes his financial difficulties to his 2014 divorce and his 2016 \nunemployment, and extra costs he incurs when his child or stepchildren visit. He also \ntestified that he falls behind on paying expenses in the summer because of high utility \ncosts. He did not provide evidence of financial counseling or professional assistance with \nhis finances. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n5 \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a), (c), and (f). \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies, partially due to his 2014 divorce \nand a relatively short period of unemployment in 2016, however, he has not shown that \nhe was dedicated to good-faith efforts to resolve most of the delinquent debts until after \nhis SOR was issued, and after his security clearance hearing. Applicant failed to file his \n2016 federal income tax return when due, and finally prepared it within weeks of his \nhearing. His reasons for not filing are unconvincing and display a lack of effort and \nattention. He has not shown sufficient evidence that his 2016 federal income tax return \nwas filed with the IRS. Applicant has not submitted sufficient evidence to mitigate SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, c, d, g, h, j, and m. Of note, the largest debts remain unresolved. He has not \ncompleted financial counseling, has not shown evidence of financial stability, and he has \nnot shown that his financial problems are under control and will not recur. \n \nApplicant admitted his own lack of financial responsibility. His income appears to \nbe insufficient to meet his financial obligations, and he does not have a reasonable plan \nto pay delinquent debts or to prevent further indebtedness. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial \nstatus raises significant doubts about his financial management decisions and personal \nfinancial responsibility. I am not convinced Applicant makes good financial decisions, and \n\n \n7 \n \nhis financial status continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. No mitigation conditions fully apply with the exception of resolved debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, f, i, k, and l. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, efforts to resolve debts, work performance, and character \nletters. However, due to Applicant\u2019s history of failing to address longstanding debts and \nfailure to file his federal income tax return when due, I remain unconvinced of his \ntrustworthiness, financial responsibility, and ability and willingness to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a, b, c, d, g, h, j, and m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1. e, f, i, k, and l: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 22, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on April 12, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. On June 27, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me and issued a Notice of Hearing \nsetting the case for August 14, 2019. The case was heard as scheduled. Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 into evidence. Applicant testified \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nand offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F into evidence.

(Tr. 7-8, 23-25, 28-29; GE 1, GE 5)  \n \n \nApplicant started having financial problems in 2007, after she and her husband \npurchased a condominium. She stated that the housing market crisis between 2007 and \n2008 negatively affected their motivation to pay the mortgage payments, as the mortgage \nbalance was higher than the value of the property. They lived there until 2011, when they \nmoved into her parents\u2019 home. In March 2013, the mortgagor started foreclosing on the \nproperty. In April 2014, the court entered a final foreclosure order. (Tr. 28, 30-31; GE 1, \nGE 6) They purchased another home in 2015. (Tr. 51) \n \n \nAfter submitting her November 17, 2017 SCA, Applicant was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator on February 21, 2018. During the interview, Applicant discussed \nher delinquent debts, including her student loans, the debts subsequently alleged in the \nFebruary 22, 2019 SOR. (GE 5)  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from August 2018 and May 2019, the SOR \nalleged nine debts that became delinquent between 2012 and 2017, and totaled $39,480. \n(GE 4, GE 5) The status of each debt is as follows: \n \n  \n1. (1.a) Applicant admitted that there was a $19,950 deficiency balance owed on \nher mortgage when it was foreclosed in 2013. However, she is no longer \nresponsible for it according to a state\u2019s Department of Housing, which does not \npursue mortgage deficiencies on defaulted loans. Additionally, the original \n\n \n \n \n \n3\ncreditor is no longer in business. (Tr. 32-33; GE 6; Answer; AE A) This debt is \nresolved. \n  \n2. (1.b) Applicant\u2019s two student loans total over $94,000. She took out the initial \nloans in 2005. During her February 2018 interview, she said she had not made \nsignificant payments on the loans, but intended to begin a payment plan in \nMarch 2018. At the time the SOR was filed in February 2019, the accounts had \na past due amount of $3,035. As of April 5, 2019, the loans were in forbearance \nuntil August 27, 2019. That deadline was extended to November 26, 2019, at \nwhich time Applicant agreed to begin monthly payments of $260. (Tr. 33-35; \nAnswer; GE 4, GE 5; AE B) The last time Applicant made consistent payments \non her student loans was several years ago, though she said she made some \nmonthly payments of $25 while she was unemployed. (Tr. 54-55) This debt is \nnot sufficiently resolved or being resolved. \n \n3. (1.c) In February 2019, Applicant entered into a Consent Judgment with a credit \ncard creditor. She agreed to begin making bi-monthly payments of $50 on the \ndelinquent $3,461 credit card debt. She has made seven payments. Prior to \nthis agreement, she had begun making payments of $25 to the creditor in \nOctober 2018, but then stopped. The creditor filed a lawsuit in November 2018. \n(Tr. 35-37; Answer; GE 7; AE C) This debt is being resolved.  \n \n4. (1.d) This delinquent $1,739 debt is owed to a jewelry store for a purchase \nApplicant made in 2015. In October 2018, Applicant negotiated a payment plan \nwith the creditor. She began making monthly payments of $50 in February \n2019, but was unable to continue making them. She subsequently re-\nnegotiated the debt and plans to begin monthly payments of $59 in September \n2019. (Tr. 36-38; AE D) This debt is not sufficiently resolved. \n \n5. (1.f) In August 2019, Applicant made a $75 payment on the $343 medical debt, \nleaving a balance of $225. She will make the final payments at the end of \nSeptember 2019 (Tr. 38-40; AE F) This debt is being resolved. \n \n6. (1.g) Applicant disclosed this $150 medical debt in her security clearance \napplication based on her credit report. After investigating it, she has been \nunable to locate a creditor to pay. She said she contacted the medical provider, \nwho indicated that it did not have any outstanding bill for her. (Tr. 40-41) This \ndebt is resolved.  \n \n7. (1.h) Applicant disclosed this $200 medical debt in her security clearance \napplication based on her credit report. After investigating it, she has been \nunable to locate a creditor to pay, including the medical provider. (Tr. 41-42) \nThis debt is resolved.  \n \n8. (1.i) The $840 debt owed to a local government is for unpaid parking tickets. \nApplicant tried to establish a repayment plan with the agency, but it does not \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ndo that. She intends to pay it after she completes payments on some of her \nestablished payment plans. (Tr. 42-43) This debt is unresolved.   \n \n \n9. (1.j) The $8,489 judgment owed to a condominium association was entered \nagainst Applicant in 2016, after the property foreclosure was completed. In \nNovember 2018, she began contacting the creditor for a payment plan and \nsubsequently initiated one for resolving the judgment. She documented seven \npayments from June 2017 to July 2018, in the amounts of $106 and $282, and \nthen apparently stopped making them. (GE 2) In March 2019, she entered into \nanother agreement to settle the judgment (now $9,624) through monthly \npayments of $535, beginning in April 2019. She presented evidence that she \nmade the full payments in April, May, and June 2019; she made partial \npayments of $267 in July and August 2019. (Tr. 43-47) This debt is not \nsufficiently resolved. \n \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a written family budget. She acknowledged that \nshe and her husband had not been working with one on a monthly basis. She stated that \nthey recently took a financial workshop at their church. (Tr. 61-62) \n \n \nAccording to her budget, Applicant and her husband have a net monthly income \nof approximately $8,320. After paying monthly expenses, they have about $2,000 \nremaining each month, which should be sufficient for Applicant to make her $260 student \nloan payment in November, as it is not included in the submitted budget that covers \nSeptember through December 2019. Applicant and her husband earn about $145,000 \nannually, and have done so for the past couple years. (AE H) Applicant\u2019s husband also \nhas outstanding student loans, though she does not know the amount or payment status. \n(Tr. 54) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n \n \n \n5\neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of inability and unwillingness to satisfy debts that began in \n2007 and continues into the present. According to her budget, she has about $2,000 \nremaining in her budget at the end of each month, which could be used to resolve \ndelinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out four conditions that could potentially mitigate \nthose financial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been ongoing for more than 10 years. The \nevidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Some of Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties may be attributable to the real estate crisis that affected her ability to pay a \nmortgage after she purchased her first house in 2007. That was a circumstance beyond \nher control. However, she did not present sufficient evidence to prove that the loss of \nequity impacted her ability to make agreed payments, or that she responsibly managed \nher delinquent debts under the circumstances. The evidence does not establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nApplicant recently participated in a financial workshop through her church. While \nthere is evidence that she resolved five of the nine alleged delinquent debts, there is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that the other four delinquent debts are under control. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nThe evidence does not establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant has not \nprovided sufficient evidence of having initiated good-faith efforts to resolve the larger \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.i, and 1.j. She did not begin to seriously address these \ndebts until after she started the security process and received the SOR. Only recently has \nshe established a budget to manage her finances, including delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent 42-year-old woman. She has held a security clearance \nfor over ten years, during which time she began to accumulate debts, some of which she \nhas not adequately addressed or sufficiently resolved. Although she testified candidly \nabout her delinquent debts, it was clear that she did not have a firm grasp on her debts \nor budget, and has not established a solid and significant track record of responsible \nfinancial management. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element of the whole-\nperson analysis in financial cases stating:  \n \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \n\n \n \n \n \n8\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic.  \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted).  \n \nAfter listening to Applicant\u2019s testimony, observing her demeanor, and reviewing \nher new budget, I believe that she is now more committed to responsibly managing her \nfinancial obligations. However, the record evidence leaves me with concerns as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for a security clearance at this time. Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n    \n \n     For Applicant \n       Subparagraph 1.b: \n \n \n         Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n     For Applicant \n       Subparagraph 1.d: \n \n \n \n Against Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n    \n \n     For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n              For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n     For Applicant \n      Subparagraph 1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n       Subparagraph 1.j: \n \n \n \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The record in this case \nclosed 19 June 2019, when Applicant=s response to the FORM was due. Applicant \nsubmitted no additional documents. DOHA assigned the case to me 9 July 2019. \n \n                     \n1Consisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-7. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective 8 \nJune 2017. \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted failing to timely file his 2015-2016 Federal income tax returns, \nand accumulating over $20,000 delinquent debt (SOR 1.a-1.k). He is a 41-year-old truck \ndriver employed by a U.S. defense contractor since March 2016. He was briefly un-\nemployed January-March 2016, but has otherwise been continually employed in similar \npositions since December 2005. He has never married and has no children. He has not \npreviously held a clearance (Item 3). \n      \nApplicant disclosed SOR debts 1.a and 1.i on his March 2016 clearance \napplication (Item 2). Applicant discussed his failures to file, and all the SOR debts except \nSOR 1.c, during his August  2018 interview with a Government investigator (Item 4), \nbased on his April 2016 credit report (Item 5). He attributed his failure to timely file his \nFederal income tax returns for the years at issue to being lazy. He stated his intent to file \nhis delinquent tax returns in April 2019, along with his 2018 income tax return. He also \ndescribed the nine delinquent debts on his April 2016 credit report and stated his intent \nto investigate the current status of the debts and make arrangements to resolve them. \nHowever, he has neither claimed nor documented any actions taken. \n \nApplicant=s Answer (Item 2) admitted the SOR allegations, but did not otherwise \nilluminate his financial situation. Applicant documented no credit or financial counseling, \nand did not submit a budget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence \nof community involvement. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s eligibility for access in favor of the Government.3 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his 2015-\n2016 Federal income tax returns. He has stated no credible reason for his failures, and \nhis admitted laziness sheds no favorable light on his failure to timely file his tax returns. \nHe documented no efforts to address his $20,000 delinquent debt.4  \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \n \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access to \nclassified information. Indeed, the Board has previously noted \nthat a person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal \nobligation to file income tax returns may be said not to have \ndemonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability \nrequired for access to classified information.@5 \n \nThis is true whether the failure to file is6 or attributed to the press of other \ncircumstances.7 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \n \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant=s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that apply \n                     \n3See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4&19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n5ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge=s favorable \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n6See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester) \n7See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). \n\n4 \nto the handling of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A person who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information). \nSee also Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. \nMcElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff=d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). Indeed, as the Judge noted, Directive, Enclosure \n2 & 19(g) explicitly provides that failure to file tax returns is a \ncircumstance that can raise a security concern. Moreover, the \nDirective presumes a nexus between admitted or proven \nconduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant=s \neligibility for a clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04648 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015). \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an Applicant \nis financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case his failure \nto timely file his Federal returns for two years leaves potentially unresolved tax debt, along \nwith the consumer debt. \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nindebtedness and his failures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and \nthe circumstances are not demonstrated to be unlikely to recur.8 Moreover, he has not \ndemonstrated that his indebtedness and failures to timely file were due to circumstances \nbeyond his control, and it is clear that he has not been responsible in addressing his debts \nor his taxes.9 Applicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and he has not \ndocumented that the debts are being resolved.10 The lack of documentation means he \ncannot demonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.11\nThe missing details of his current tax status requires the same conclusion \nregarding his taxes.12 Moreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might \n8&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . .  \n9&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n10&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n11&20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n12&20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate to file or pay the amount owed and is \nin compliance with those arrangements:  \n\n5 \nsupport a whole-person assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his \nconduct. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nFindings Formal \nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs a-k \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nClearance denied. \n----------------------------------------- \nJOHN GRATTAN METZ, JR \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 5, 2010, and again on May 1, 2018, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) \nversions of a Security Clearance Application. On March 6, 2019, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016) (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse), and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn separate notarized statements, dated March 22, 2019, and May 3, 2019, \nApplicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \non June 5, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after \nreceipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM \non June 11, 2019. His response was due on July 11, 2019. Applicant timely submitted \none document in response to the FORM, and it was admitted without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on August 7, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both of the factual allegations \npertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse of the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.); \nas well as the two factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and \n2.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior cyber security specialist with his current employer since February 2011. He \npreviously served as a software engineer with two different defense contractors from May \n1993 until February 2002, and from November 2008 until January 2011.  A 1970 high \nschool graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1974, and although he \nsubsequently earned additional college credits, he has not received any other advanced \ndegrees. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was initially granted a secret \nclearance in August 1979, and that clearance was periodically renewed. Applicant was \nmarried in 1980 and divorced in 1984. He remarried in 2001 and divorced in 2002 or \n2003. He has been residing with a cohabitant in a \u201ccivil marriage, legally recognized civil \nunion, or legally recognized domestic partnership\u201d since 2018. He has no children. \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana. His initial period of such drug involvement and substance misuse commenced \nin about June 1979 \u2013 a few months before he was granted a security clearance \u2013 and \ncontinued until about June 1981, well into the period in which he held the security \nclearance. He acknowledged that he smoked marijuana on approximately 25 occasions. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nAlthough he was in his mid-to-late 20s at the time, Applicant referred to his behavior as \n\u201cyouthful indiscretion\u201d with \u201cperhaps a little too much appetite for adventure.\u201d The record \nis silent regarding how he obtained the marijuana, or if he paid for it. Applicant does not \nremember with whom he smoked the marijuana or where he smoked it. He acknowledged \nthat he never received drug counseling or treatment, and he denied that his marijuana \nuse caused him any financial, criminal, or security issues. There is no indication that \nApplicant ever informed his employer that he was using marijuana during the period of \nhis use, and he has acknowledged that no one was aware of it. (Item 3, at 5-6; Item 1) \n \nIn December 2017, Applicant attended a funeral for a \u201cbeloved old friend\u201d with old \nfriends that he had known since college, but whose names he could not reveal. As a \n\u201cspecial one-time event,\u201d Applicant participated in what he referred to as a \u201cceremonial \npartaking,\u201d during which he smoked marijuana. (Item 3, at 5; Item 1) He acknowledged \nthat he never received drug counseling or treatment, and he denied that his marijuana \nuse caused him any financial, criminal, or security issues. Applicant did not inform his \nemployer that he had used marijuana in December 2017. \n \n \nApplicant contended that he outgrew his marijuana-using behavior \u201ca long time \nago,\u201d and that, with the exception of the ceremonial partaking in 2017, he has had no \ndesire or intention to use any controlled substance in the future. He is willing to submit to \ntesting to prove that he will no longer use any controlled substances. (AE 1) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nOn April 5, 2010, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to certain \nquestions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23. The \nmost significant question, and the one alleged in the SOR, was essentially as follows: \n\u201cHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while possessing a security \nclearance. . . ?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question. (Item 4, at 45) He omitted and \nconcealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana that started before he received his \nsecurity clearance and continued until June 1981. He certified that his response to that \nquestion was \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but, \nbecause of his omission and concealment, the response to that question was, in fact, \nfalse.  \n \nApplicant did not controvert the falsification allegation. In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant submitted two responses to the allegation. He admitted deliberately failing to \ndisclose his illegal drug use in his e-QIP. In another section of his Answer, he \nacknowledged that he answered the question untruthfully, and he could not understand \nwhy he did so. His response \u201cbothers [Applicant] personally and [he has] sincere regrets.\u201d \n(Item 1) He did not claim that he misinterpreted the question, or that he forgot his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. \n \nTo his credit, when Applicant completed his most recent e-QIP in May 2018, he \nacknowledged both his earlier marijuana use as well as his December 2017 marijuana \nuse. However, it appears that he sought to minimize both activities by claiming the initial \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nmarijuana use occurred many decades ago, and the most recent use was merely for \n\u201cceremonial purposes.\u201d (Item 2, at 47-48) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n  \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant admittedly was a recreational substance abuser between June 1979 and \nJune 1981. Although he did not use marijuana for nearly four decades thereafter, in \nDecember 2017, he once again succumbed to smoking marijuana as part of what he \ndescribed as a \u201cceremonial partaking.\u201d He held a security clearance from August 1979 \nuntil the present day. While the record is silent regarding the purchase or possession of \nmarijuana, Applicant obviously possessed the marijuana before and while using it. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nNeither condition applies. Applicant\u2019s initial recreational use of marijuana from \nJune 1979 until June 1981 occurred when he was in his mid-to-late 20s, and all but the \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nfirst two months took place while he was in possession of a security clearance. As such, \nthere was nothing infrequent about his marijuana use, and there is no evidence to indicate \nthat it happened under such circumstances that it was unlikely to recur. If that would have \nbeen his last use of marijuana, his security clearance might not now be under review. \nWhile that period of marijuana use was followed by nearly four decades of abstinence, \nApplicant returned to his old ways in December 2017 by smoking marijuana with old \nfriends while attending a funeral. Applicant sought to minimize both activities by claiming \nthe initial marijuana use occurred many decades ago, and the most recent use was \nmerely for \u201cceremonial purposes.\u201d  \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, the most recent drug involvement and substance misuse, was in \nDecember 2017. Given his cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cceremonial\u201d use of marijuana, while still holding a security clearance, after \nnearly four decades of abstinence, despite knowing that such use was prohibited by both \nthe Government and his employer, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his initial e-QIP in April 2010, he \nconcealed any references to his history of drug involvement and substance misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s comments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions were \ndeliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely inaccurate answers that were \nthe result of oversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Proof of incorrect \nanswers, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind \nwhen the falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider \nthe record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the alleged \nfalsifications or omissions occurred.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admission of the SOR \nallegation. As noted above, Applicant did not controvert the falsification allegation. In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant submitted two responses to the allegation. He admitted \nfailing to disclose his illegal drug use in his e-QIP. In another section of his Answer, he \nacknowledged that he answered the question untruthfully, and he could not understand \nwhy he did so. His response \u201cbothers [Applicant] personally and [he has] sincere regrets.\u201d \nHe did not claim that he misinterpreted the question, or that he forgot his drug involvement \nand substance misuse. In addition, aside from his lack of candor with respect to the 2010 \ne-QIP, there is Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement and substance misuse, and his \npersonal conduct. As to the deliberate falsification on the e-QIP regarding his drug \nactivity, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) has been established. As to the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and Applicant\u2019s personal conduct allegation associated with his 2017 marijuana \nuse, AG \u00b6 16(c) has been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s history of drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse initially took place from June 1979 and lasted until June 1981; and then \nreappeared in December 2017. His false response to the e-QIP inquiry occurred in April \n2010. It took eight years, but Applicant finally acknowledged his history of drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse when he completed his May 2018 e-QIP. However, \nbefore that e-QIP admission, he made no efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification associated with his 2010 e-QIP. Far from being infrequent, Applicant\u2019s initial \ndrug involvement and substance misuse was routine during June 1979 until June 1981, \nand although there were decades of abstinence, he reverted back to what he referred to \nas ceremonial partaking of marijuana. His attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, \nespecially while holding a security clearance, has lasted for a lengthy period. Applicant\u2019s \nactions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.1  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 66-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior cyber security \nspecialist with his current employer since February 2011, and before that he served as a \nsoftware engineer with two different defense contractors from May 1993 until February \n2002, and from November 2008 until January 2011. A 1970 high school graduate, \n                                                          \n1 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1974, and subsequently earned additional \ncollege credits. He was initially granted a security clearance in August 1979, and that \nclearance was periodically renewed. He abstained from any drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse for nearly four decades after June 1981 until December 2017. \nApplicant finally disclosed his use of marijuana when he completed his most recent e-QIP \nin May 2018. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant admittedly was a recreational substance abuser between June 1979 and June \n1981. Although he did not use marijuana for nearly four decades thereafter, in December \n2017, he once again succumbed to smoking marijuana as part of what he described as a \n\u201cceremonial partaking.\u201d He held a security clearance from August 1979 until the present \nday. It appears that Applicant sought to minimize the significance of his marijuana use \nduring both periods by claiming the initial marijuana use occurred many decades ago and \nwas the result of youthful indiscretion, and the most recent use was merely for \u201cceremonial \npurposes.\u201d In April 2010, when Applicant completed his initial e-QIP, he concealed any \nreferences to his history of drug involvement and substance misuse. Applicant finally \nacknowledged his history of drug involvement and substance misuse when he completed \nhis May 2018 e-QIP, but before that e-QIP admission, he made no efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification associated with his 2010 e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s \nattitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, especially while holding a security \nclearance, has lasted for a lengthy period.  \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse; and personal conduct.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n11/15/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns triggered by his marijuana use while \nholding a security clearance and his deliberate omissions about his drug use on multiple \nsecurity clearance questionnaires. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) in March 2010, May \n2015, February 2016, and March 2018. On March 15, 2019, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). Applicant answered the SOR on April 1, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (Answer). The Government sent an amended SOR to \nApplicant on June 10, 2019. The Government was ready to proceed on June 12, 2019. \nApplicant answered the amended SOR on June 20, 2019, and the case was assigned \nto me on August 15, 2019. On August 22, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 25, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 \n\n \n2 \n \nwere admitted without objection, and Applicant testified. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 3, 2019, and the record closed.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nApplicant, 29, is divorced, and he has one young son from a subsequent \nrelationship. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2017, and he is currently in \na master\u2019s degree program. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from August 2010 until \nhe was honorably discharged in August 2016. Since September 2019, he has worked \nas a cyber-security analyst for a defense contractor. (Tr. 9-12)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and amended SOR. (Answer; \nAmended SOR; Tr. 15) \n \n \nApplicant started using marijuana in 2006, while he was in high school. He \ncontinued to use marijuana until December 2009. Additionally, he used cocaine and \nused without a prescription various medications in 2009. In March 2010, Applicant \ncompleted his first SCA (2010 SCA), and he did not disclose any drug use. Applicant \ntestified that he initially disclosed his history of drug use in his 2010 SCA. He was \nadvised by his Army recruiter to change his 2010 SCA in order to be eligible to receive \npreferred positions in the Army. Applicant did not seek additional guidance regarding \nthis issue, nor did he disclose his drug use during a subsequent interview with a \ngovernment investigator. (Answer; GE 3 at 38; GE 5 at 8-9; GE 6 at 3; Tr. 20-22) \n \n \nFrom 2010 until 2013, Applicant did not use marijuana and did not spend time \nwith people who used marijuana. In April 2010 he received a top secret sensitive- \ncompartmentalized information (SCI) security clearance. In June 2013, Applicant drank \ntoo much alcohol and chose to use marijuana with a stranger. Applicant did not report \nhis June 2013 drug use to his command or security manager, because he knew he \nwould there would be work-related consequences for using illegal drugs. (GE 4; GE 6 at \n2-4; Tr. 23-24)  \n \n \nIn May 2015, Applicant completed a second SCA (2015 SCA). He did not \ndisclose his 2008 to 2009 and 2013 drug use, because he believed his 2010 SCA and \n2015 SCA should be consistent. During the subsequent subject interview with a \ngovernment investigator Applicant did not disclose: his history of drug use; his failure to \ndisclose his drug use in his two SCAs; and his failure to disclose his drug use during his \n2010 subject interview. (Answer; GE 2 at 35-36; GE 5 at 9; Tr. 24-26) \n \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant used marijuana while visiting a former Army friend. \nHe did not report this use to his command or security manager, because he was \nconcerned about the ramifications and repercussions on his career and security \nclearance. (GE 5; GE 6; Tr. 26, 54) \n \n \nApplicant completed a third SCA in February 2016 (2016 SCA), and again, he did \nnot disclose his history of drug use. (This SCA was not offered into evidence, but it is \nreferenced in GE 6 at 2.) In June 2016, while still on active duty in the Army, Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \napplied for a job with a defense contractor, who sponsored him for access to SCI. \nApplicant then underwent a polygraph examination with another government agency \n(AGA). During the pre-examination interview, Applicant disclosed using marijuana every \nday or every other day from August to December 2009. He also claimed that he \nunintentionally used marijuana one time in 2014, but this was the full extent of his drug \nuse. The examiner told Applicant he did not pass the exam after the first round of \nquestions. Applicant then disclosed his use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance in 2013 and 2015. He also disclosed illegally using cocaine and prescription \ndrugs without a prescription in 2009. In July 2016, the AGA denied Applicant SCI \neligibility. (GE 5 at 9; GE 6; Tr. 27-32, 44-45) \n \n \nApplicant was discharged from the Army in August 2016, and he received a 70%- \ndisability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Applicant started using \nand purchasing marijuana in January 2017 due to chronic pain. He did not want to use \ntraditional pain medication. From January 2017 until March 2017, he used marijuana \nevery other day. Applicant stopped using marijuana in March 2017, to focus on his \nfamily responsibilities. (GE 5 at 3, 8; Tr. 32-35) \n \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant used marijuana one time after his best friend \ncommitted suicide in their home. In December 2017, Applicant was offered a position by \ndefense contractor, contingent upon him securing a security clearance. He obtained a \nmedical marijuana card in January 2018. He completed a fourth SCA in March 2018 \n(2018 SCA), and he disclosed using marijuana while holding a security clearance in \nJune 2013 and September 2015. Applicant also indicated that he used marijuana every \nother day from early January 2017 to August 2017. (GE 1 at 40-41; GE 5 at 7-8; Tr. 36-\n41, 43) \n \n \nApplicant started using marijuana again in July 2018. He started using marijuana \nagain, despite seeking a security clearance, because there was no guarantee that he \nwould obtain a clearance and he was in pain. Additionally, he believed his use was \nlegal. Applicant did not consult with his sponsor as to whether medicinal use of \nmarijuana was allowed, because he believed his marijuana use was legal. (GE 1; Tr. \n41-45) \n \n \nIn his October 2018 subject interview, which he adopted in February 2019, \nApplicant disclosed that he intended to continue to use medical marijuana until he \nobtained a security clearance. He claimed that that the only drug he had ever misused \nwas marijuana, and that he last used marijuana in October 2018. Applicant stopped \npurchasing marijuana in October 2018, due to the expense. Applicant\u2019s last drug test \noccurred while he was on active duty in the Army. The last time Applicant was around \npeople who were using marijuana was during the summer of 2019. While at a friend\u2019s \nhouse, he was offered marijuana, but he did not use it. (GE 5 at 2, 8-9; Tr. 46-47, 50-52) \n  \n \nApplicant deployed to Jordan and Afghanistan while he was on active duty. He \nreceived two Army Commendation Medals and two Army Good Conduct Medals. \nAccording to Applicant, the two nights Applicant used marijuana while on active duty \n\n \n4 \n \nwere insignificant, and he does not consider himself to be a habitual marijuana user. \n(Tr. 48-50, 52-53) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nAppellant\u2019s decision to use illegal drugs, while he was on active duty and held a \nsecurity clearance, cannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather a pattern \nof behavior that reflects his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations. Security \nclearance decisions are not limited to conduct during duty hours; off-duty conduct, \nespecially where it reflects poor judgment, provides a rational basis for the government \nto question an appellant\u2019s security worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, \n550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989)). \nApplicant\u2019s behavior showed a disregard for the law, regulations, and the fiduciary \nrelationship he voluntarily entered into with the government. \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 2006 to 2009, once in 2013, once in 2015, from \nJanuary to March 2017, once in August 2017, and from July 2018 to October 2018. He \nused marijuana while he was on active duty in the Army and held a security clearance. \nApplicant did not report this use to his command or security manager, nor was it \ndetected through urinalyses. He used marijuana in 2018, after he applied again for a \nsecurity clearance. His claim that he did not realize his use was illegal was self-serving \nas he did not seek clarification from his sponsor.  \n \nApplicant was at a friend\u2019s party during the summer of 2019, and he was offered \nmarijuana. He claimed that he has not used marijuana since October 2018; however, he \nhas failed to be forthright and consistent with the government regarding his history of \ndrug use since 2010. Despite completing multiple SCAs and subject interviews between \n2010 and 2016, Applicant\u2019s drug use did not come out until he was confronted during \nhis polygraph examination. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s assertions that he is drug free \nafforded little mitigation with respect to his drug use, and he did not establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \n\n \n7 \n \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted falsifications of his 2010 SCA and 2015 SCA, buttressed by \nthe documentary evidence, established the following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 \n16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \nmitigating. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his history of drug use in his 2010 SCA, 2010 subject \ninterview, 2015 SCA, 2015 subject interview, and 2016 SCA. Although he did disclose \nsome drug use during the pre-examination component of his 2016 polygraph \nexamination, he also made false statements regarding his history of drug use. He \nclaimed his marijuana use in 2014 was unintentional, which was not true. Additionally, \nhe failed to disclose his intentional use of marijuana while holding a clearance and his \nmisuse of cocaine and prescription medications. Finally, in his October 2018 subject \ninterview, Applicant made the false claim that the only drug he had ever misused was \nmarijuana.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant made deliberate choices to keep the government in the dark regarding \nhis behavior, raising the concern that he is unreliable and untrustworthy and calling into \nquestion his judgment and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. This \nconcern has not been mitigated by the passage of time. Neither of the mitigating \nconditions apply in this case. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \n \n \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and denied \u00b6 1.e. As to the cross allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a, he admitted and denied consistent with his earlier admissions and denials. He denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old. He has been married for 38 years. He and his wife have two adult children born from their marriage and they adopted three girls from an African nation in approximately 2009 (A1, A2, A3). The adopted daughters no longer reside with Applicant and his wife. He currently works for a defense contractor for whom he has worked for 15 years. He has two master\u2019s degrees.

The DOD \nacted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, \n2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23, 2019, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 7, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 10, 2019, and the hearing was held \nas scheduled on July 24, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A through \nO, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as HE II. The record was held open until August 9, 2019, to allow Applicant to \nprovide additional evidence. He failed to submit anything. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 12, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and denied \u00b6 1.e. As to the \ncross allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a, he admitted and denied consistent with his earlier \nadmissions and denials. He denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b. The admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He has been married for 38 years. He and his wife \nhave two adult children born from their marriage and they adopted three girls from an \nAfrican nation in approximately 2009 (A1, A2, A3). The adopted daughters no longer \nreside with Applicant and his wife. He currently works for a defense contractor for whom \nhe has worked for 15 years. He has two master\u2019s degrees. In 2001, he retired from the \nAir Force after 21 years of honorable service as a lieutenant colonel (O-5). He has held \na security clearance for over 40 years. (Tr. 17-19; GE 1; AE A-B)   \n \n \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleged Applicant is currently registered as a sex \noffender in his state of residence (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he is on intensive supervised \nprobation from 10 years to life after pleading guilty to criminal attempt to commit \naggravated incest (this is not the language from the SOR, which the facts at hearing \nrevealed to be incorrect, but is the correct charge to which Applicant pleaded guilty) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he was arrested in September 2015 and charged with three counts of \nsexual assault of a child under 15 years while being in a position of trust and one count \nof aggravated incest (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d); that he engaged in incest and aggravated sexual \nassault of his minor child from about April 2014 to about July 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). All \nthese allegations were also cross-alleged under Guidelines J and E (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 3.a). \nAdditionally, under Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant failed to notify his security \noffice of the stated arrest and subsequent conviction and sentencing in May 2016 until \nDecember 2016 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.c). (Tr. 32, 34; GE 3-5) \n \n \n \nIn August 2015, A3, who was 13 years old at the time, disclosed to a caseworker \nthat Applicant, her father, had touched her breasts and made inappropriate comments. \nA few days later, A3 participated in a forensic interview. A3 disclosed that before the \ntouching, her father was her \u201cbest friend\u201d and that she trusted him. She then stated, \u201cbut \nI don\u2019t trust him anymore.\u201d She described Applicant coming into her room when her \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmother was gone and asking her if he could touch her \u201cboobs.\u201d She told him no. The \nnext day he came in and began touching her without asking. She did not tell him to stop \nbecause she was scared. She was scared because of his military background and she \nbelieved he was strong and could do anything he wanted. She felt like she had no \nchoice other than let him touch her. Applicant touched her breasts under her clothing. \nA3 told the interviewer that Applicant\u2019s touching began when she was 12 years old and \nhappened more than once. She described another time Applicant touched her when he \ncame into her room with just his underwear on and touched her breasts. Another time \nApplicant came into her room after her alarm had gone off and laid down in her bed and \n\u201ccuddled\u201d her, pulled up her shirt, and touched her breasts. A3 also described, through \nher words and drawing, an occasion when Applicant pulled down her underwear and \ntouched her groin area. She stated that this type of touching happened more than once. \nA3 told her mother about the touching. Applicant told A3 not to tell anyone about the \ntouching because it would get him in \u201cbig trouble.\u201d (GE 3) \n \n \nIn September 2015, after A3\u2019s disclosures, Applicant was charged with four \ncounts of sexual assault of a child and one count of aggravated incest. A plea \nagreement was reached and in May 2016, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of \nattempted aggravated incest and all the original charges were dropped. His sentence \nincluded 10 years to life on sex offender intensive supervised probation (SOISP); \nSOISP weekly counseling; placement on a sex offender\u2019s registry (registration a yearly \nrequirement); no contact with minor children; restrictions on travel; and other related \nrequirements. He was not sentenced to any jail time. He remains on SOISP. (Tr. 22-27; \nAE 3-5) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background investigation, he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator in September 2018 about the above-described criminal actions. Applicant \nclaimed that his criminal assaults took place on only two occasions two weeks apart in \nApril 2015. He admitted touching A3\u2019s breasts under her clothes. He was aroused by \nher. There was no one else present at the time. The following weekend the second \nassault occurred. He once again touched her breasts as he had before, then he placed \nhis hand under her pajamas touching her pubic hair near her vagina. He claims he \nstopped at that point realizing what he was doing was wrong and criminal. In his hearing \ntestimony, Applicant maintained that he only assaulted A3 two times by touching her \nbreasts. He denied going into her room wearing only his underwear and, contrary to his \nstatement to the investigator, he denied touching her groin area. (Tr. 56-61; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant related that A3 was seven years old when she was adopted and that \nshe suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reactive detachment \ndisorder (RDD) because of things she experienced as a young child in her home \ncountry. He also discovered that she had been raped in her former country. He was \naware of all these factors at the time he assaulted her. He acknowledged that he was in \na position of trust relative to A3. (Tr. 51-55; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor indicated that Applicant kept the appropriate people \nnotified within the company regarding his being charged, arrested, entering into a plea \n\n \n4 \n \n \nagreement, pleading guilty, and being sentenced. A Joint Personal Adjudication System \n(JPAS) document shows a single entry from December 2016 indicating his plea. \nApplicant testified that he kept his chain of command informed of all events related to \nhis criminal charge. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to provide a statement \nfrom his security officer on this issue. No further evidence was received. (Tr. 46-47; AE \nA) \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from his probation officer (PO) who stated that he has \ncomplied with all his probation terms to date. Several of his probation requirements \nhave been loosened, such as, allowing Applicant to travel out of state and allowing him \nsupervised visits with his grandchild. The PO indicated that Applicant meets the criteria \nto \u201cbe progressed off intensive supervision.\u201d He also maintained a low risk score for \nreoffending on all assessments completed by the PO. (Tr. 29-30, 49-50; AE O) \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from his therapist (T) who provided treatment to him in \naccordance with his sexual offense conviction. T stated that he has treated Applicant for \nthe past three years. T further stated that Applicant was fully accountable for his offense \nand has remained accountable to his probation rules and therapy requirements. He \nconstructed a relapse prevention plan while in therapy. He completed his sex offense \nspecific treatment. In terms of risk measurement regarding reoffending, Applicant is \nbelow the average adult male sex offender who has completed treatment. (Tr. 49; AE N) \n \n \nApplicant presented 13 reference letters from coworkers, friends, his biological \ndaughter, his son-in-law, and other acquaintances. All the letters describe Applicant in \nthe most positive light, emphasizing his integrity, honesty, family orientation, and church \nand community service. None of the letters indicate whether the authors were familiar \nwith the facts surrounding this conviction. Applicant provided evidence concerning his \nmilitary awards and decorations, two years of work appraisals for years 2016-2018, his \nacademic achievements, as well as other biographical information. (AE A-M) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted. \n \n \nApplicant pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated incest. Credible evidence \nsupports that he sexually assaulted his 12 or 13-year-old daughter on multiple \noccasions. The above disqualifying condition applies to SOR \u00b6 1.e. The remaining SOR \nallegations under this Guideline are all consequences of his actions in SOR \u00b6 1.e and \nare not independently disqualifying under this Guideline. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for sexual behavior under \nAG \u00b6 14 and considered the following potentially relevant:   \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual assaults of his adopted daughter occurred in 2014 to 2015. \nHis criminal acts were recent enough to merit a sentence of 10 years to life on probation \nto ensure ongoing supervision by the state\u2019s criminal authorities. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not \nfully apply. Applicant has made successful strides through his therapy to accept \nresponsibility for his actions. His therapist gave him a positive report and considers him \nlow risk for recidivism. However, based upon the evidence, it appears he is minimizing \nthe full extent of his criminal acts against A3. AG \u00b6 14(e) has some applicability.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and  \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \nApplicant was convicted of attempted aggravated incest, a felony, and was \nsentenced, inter alia, to 10 years\u2019 to life SOISP. I find that both disqualifying conditions \napply.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conviction occurred in 2016. Although he is three years removed from \nthat conviction, he remains on probation. He is in compliance with his probationary \nterms. However, he violated the trust of his daughter who was already the victim of a \nhorrendous childhood. His willingness to take advantage of such a vulnerable child, who \ntrusted him, casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAdditionally, Applicant gave inconsistent statements about the full extent of his criminal \nacts. This calls into question whether he has minimized his wrongdoing and therefore is \nnot fully rehabilitated. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable:   \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s occasions of committing sexual abuse on his 12 to 13-year-old \nadopted daughter demonstrates questionable behavior and raises questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Applicant\u2019s sexual \nassaults on his daughter could certainly affect his personal, professional, or community \nstanding. Regarding the two failure to report allegations, I find the evidence insufficient \nto support them. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;   \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated incest against his daughter, \nand credible evidence supports that he committed sexual assaults on multiple other \noccasions. His daughter was not just vulnerable because of her age, but also because \nof the trauma she suffered before her adoption to include being raped. Applicant was \nfully aware of her past when he chose to violate her trust by sexually abusing her. His \nactions in abusing her trust in such a fundamental relationship calls into question his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Although he has had made successful \nstrides in his therapy and is compliant with his probationary terms, he remains on \nintense supervised probation for 10 years to life. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply, but AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(d) and 17(e) have some application.  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s letters of \nrecommendation, his probation officer\u2019s letter, his counseling, his military and contractor \nachievements and evaluations, and his personal circumstances. I weighed these factors \nagainst his conviction for sexually abusing his adopted daughter and his continuing \nprobation term.   \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines D, J and E. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph     1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph     2.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph     3.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs   3.b \u2013 3.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 53-year-old married employee of a defense contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, and a master\u2019s degree in business administration. He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. He has worked for his current employer since 2012 as a senior systems engineer. He served in the Marine Corps from 1989 to 2009, retiring as a Major (O-4). He has held a security clearance almost continuously since 1989. (Tr. 29; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Applicant Exhibits D, Q.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability. Applicant denied allegations 1.a and 1.b under this paragraph. He admitted allegations 1.c and 1.d. The allegations in this case revolve around Applicant\u2019s attendance at a military postgraduate school from 2003 to 2005. Applicant completed the academic requirements for a master\u2019s degree in computer science, earning 117.5 credits. This was far above the 40 credits required for a master\u2019s degree. Applicant did complete the course of instruction so that he could go on to his next duty station. (Tr. 39-41; Government Exhibit 6.) However, Applicant did not complete his thesis, and therefore did not complete the academic requirements for a master\u2019s degree. Thus, at the graduation ceremony he received a ",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on June \n8, 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer), notarized on April 5, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on May 30, 2019. The case was assigned to me on June 5, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on June 10, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on July 29, 2019. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \noffered Applicant Exhibits A through T, which were admitted without objection. He also \ncalled one witness, and testified on his own behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave \nthe record open to permit him to submit additional evidence. He submitted Applicant \nExhibits U and V, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on August 7, 2019. \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old married employee of a defense contractor. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, and a master\u2019s degree in business administration. He is seeking to \nretain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. He has \nworked for his current employer since 2012 as a senior systems engineer. He served in \nthe Marine Corps from 1989 to 2009, retiring as a Major (O-4). He has held a security \nclearance almost continuously since 1989. (Tr. 29; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, \n13A, and 17; Applicant Exhibits D, Q.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. Applicant denied allegations 1.a and 1.b under this paragraph. He admitted \nallegations 1.c and 1.d.  \n \nThe allegations in this case revolve around Applicant\u2019s attendance at a military \npostgraduate school from 2003 to 2005. Applicant completed the academic requirements \nfor a master\u2019s degree in computer science, earning 117.5 credits. This was far above the \n40 credits required for a master\u2019s degree. Applicant did complete the course of instruction \nso that he could go on to his next duty station. (Tr. 39-41; Government Exhibit 6.) \n \nHowever, Applicant did not complete his thesis, and therefore did not complete the \nacademic requirements for a master\u2019s degree. Thus, at the graduation ceremony he \nreceived a Certificate of Completion, and not a diploma. The Certificate stated: \n \nPresented at commencement exercises. . . . To acknowledge that all course \nrequirements of study have been met. After a thorough evaluation of the \nacademic record by the . . . Postgraduate School Academic Council, and \nwhen it is determined that graduation requirements have been met, a \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ngraduate degree will be awarded. (Applicants Exhibit C, U, and V.) (See Tr. \n35, 59-60.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant filled out an e-QIP on August 12, 2011. Question 12 of the \nquestionnaire asked him about his education. He listed his attendance at the \nPostgraduate School. The questionnaire then asked, \u201cDegree/diploma received?\u201d \nApplicant said, \u201cYes.\u201d The question went on to ask the nature of the degree/diploma. \nApplicant stated, \u201cMaster\u2019s,\u201d in, \u201cComputer Science.\u201d As stated, Applicant had completed \nthe coursework requirements for a degree, but not the thesis. Accordingly, this was a \nfalse answer to a relevant question about his military education background. (Tr. 31-34; \nGovernment Exhibit 2.) \n \n \nApplicant was subsequently interviewed by an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) on November 11, 2011. The investigator reported: \n \n \nSubject [Applicant] provided the following information. \n \nSubject states that he did not [receive] a masters degree from the . . . \ncollege. Subject has completed all classwork and 90 per cent of his masters \nthesis but he has not completed the thesis and has not turned it in. \n \nSubject states that his inclusion of a masters degree in his education in the \ncase papers was incorrect. Subject states that he forgot that he has not \ncompleted the degree. Subject states that the masters degree was not \nrequired for the position that he holds and notes that he was allowed to \nmarch in the graduation ceremony being awarded a masters degree at the \nschool. (Tr. 43-45; Government Exhibit 3 at 15.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant filled out a subsequent e-QIP on November 18, 2016. Question 12 \nof this questionnaire also asked him about his education. He again put down his \nattendance at the Postgraduate School. The questionnaire again asked, \u201cDegree/diploma \nreceived?\u201d Applicant said, \u201cYes.\u201d The question went on to ask the nature of the \ndegree/diploma. Applicant stated, \u201cMaster\u2019s\u201d in, \u201cComputer Science.\u201d As stated, Applicant \nhad completed the coursework requirements for a degree, but not the thesis. Accordingly, \nthis was a false answer to a relevant question about his military education background. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he cut and pasted his 2011 e-QIP on his 2016 \nquestionnaire. The computer-generated questionnaire can be pre-populated with \nanswers from a prior questionnaire. Applicant stated that he should have been more \ndetailed in examining the new questionnaire. (Tr. 45-46.)  \n \n \n1.c. Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from OPM on August 28, 2018. \nApplicant first told the investigator that he had received a master\u2019s degree from the \nPostgraduate School. When confronted with the fact that he had not completed his thesis, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant agreed that he had not actually received the master\u2019s degree. (Tr. 47-48; \nGovernment Exhibit 3 at 6.) (See Answer at 7.)  \n \n \n1.d. Applicant prepared a resume in approximately 2017 to be used by his \nemployer. In that resume, under the heading \u201cEducation,\u201d Applicant stated that he had \nreceived a \u201cMaster of Science in Computer Science.\u201d This was a false statement since \nApplicant did not finish his thesis. (Tr. 48-50; Government Exhibit 5.) \n \n \nApplicant has now changed his resume to more accurately state, \u201cComputer \nScience Master\u2019s Curriculum.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit K at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he misrepresented earning the degree because he was \n\u201cembarrassed.\u201d He stated, \u201cI\u2019ve never not finished anything. . . . I was really shameful \nabout not completing that theses [sic].\u201d Applicant also stated that he was mad at himself. \nHe maintained that it was never his intent to deceive the government or any other entity \nor person. He did a lot of work towards the master\u2019s, and was frustrated with himself that \nhe did not get it done. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 34, 38-39, 51-52, 55-57.) \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant has told his family what happened with his education. He has been open \nand honest with his employer, as well as many friends and co-workers, who submitted \nletters of recommendation on his behalf. All seven writers indicated a knowledge of the \nallegations, and had read the SOR. Six of them had held a security clearance. Several of \nthem are retired Marine or Naval officers who first knew Applicant on active duty and \ncontinue to have a relationship with him. All the writers indicate that this conduct of \nApplicant was not typical of him, and that they are sure it will not be repeated. With \nknowledge of the SOR, all of them recommend Applicant for a position of trust. (Applicant \nExhibits B, D, I, J, L, M, and T.) \n \n \nThe founder and Chief Executive Officer of Applicant\u2019s employer wrote Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit D. He says: \n \n[Applicant] made a lapse in judgment and carried an untruthful statement \nforward. This is absolutely NOT typical. He is truthful and honest, and is \nVERY ashamed of himself. He demonstrates good character and judgment \nand has confessed his misrepresentation to his Spouse . . ., and their 3 \nboys. It has broken his heart, but he did so to teach them a lesson about \nbeing truthful, and used his fault to make a teaching point and life lesson to \nhis sons. \n \n \nApplicant Exhibit L is from a civilian attorney who has known Applicant for over a \ndecade in the community. The writer is a former Deputy United States Attorney, who also \nheld important posts in the Justice and State Departments. He wrote, \u201cI have always found \n[Applicant] to be responsible, honest and trustworthy. In our interactions together, not only \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nwas he upright and conscientious, he has been someone who I have learned to trust \nimplicitly to make wise judgments about people, situations and procedures.\u201d \n \n \nA coworker of Applicant\u2019s testified on his behalf. The witness also wrote Applicant \nExhibit I. He has known Applicant over 25 years, both in and out of the Marine Corps, and \nconsiders him a close friend. The witness finds Applicant to be trustworthy, and gave \nseveral examples of situations where Applicant has shown that ability in stressful \nsituations. (Tr. 60-70.)  \n \n \nApplicant had a successful career in the Marine Corps. He deployed into combat \nzones and received several decorations. (Applicant Exhibit E.) \n \n \nApplicant is heavily involved in charity work in his community. (Applicant Exhibits \nN, O, and P.)    \n \n \nPolicies \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an \napplicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant=s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG & 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG && 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. In addition, \nthe administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common sense, as well as \nknowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, AThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.@ Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: AAny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.@ \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \n \nThe security concern relating to Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy, or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 apply to the facts of this case: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nThere is no doubt that Applicant repeatedly misstated his educational \naccomplishments. Applicant was a talented and loyal Marine. He is a successful member \nof the defense industry. He is highly respected by people who have known him intimately \nfor years. Yet, for personal reasons connected to his ego and pride, and not for personal \ngain, Applicant was unable to admit for years that he did not receive a graduate degree \nfrom the Postgraduate School. However, on three separate occasions he stated to the \ngovernment that he had received the master\u2019s degree. He had to be confronted twice \nabout the falsehood of that statement. \n \n \nNormally, this conduct is hard to mitigate. Here, however, Applicant has gone out \nof his way to cure the possible adverse effects of this conduct. He has told his family, his \nboss, coworkers, fellow veterans, and friends that he respects. The letters of \nrecommendation supplied by Applicant are unanimous in stating that this conduct was an \naberration in Applicant\u2019s otherwise exemplary life. In addition, with full knowledge of the \nallegations, the writers recommend him for a position of trust. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 17 \n(c), (d), and (e) apply to this case.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant=s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a law-abiding, \ntrustworthy, and responsible person and employee. He has made sure that the important \npeople in his life know of his misconduct. He evinces a credible intent to not make such \nmisstatements in the future. Any potential for pressure, coercion, or duress has been \neliminated, and such conduct is unlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence does not \ncreate doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility. \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His youngest sister is married \nand has one daughter. She is a student and lives with her family. Applicant sent his niece \nsome money for school supplies. He speaks to his sister monthly. The occupations of his \nsisters\u2019 husbands are unknown. (Tr. 51-54) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin is a citizen and resident of Iraq. He is married and has children. \nHe is a police officer with Iraqi police department. Applicant speaks to him monthly. (Tr. \n54-57) \n \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s siblings and cousin reside near Applicant\u2019s parents. None of them \nhave visited him in the United States. When Applicant speaks to his family, they talk about \nfamily matters and not personal things. None of these people are aware that Applicant is \napplying for a linguist position. (Tr. 62-63)  \n \n \n \nApplicant has three friends who are citizens and residents of Iraq. None of them \nare employed by the Iraqi government or military. He does not send them money. He talks \nor texts them every couple months. They have never visited the United States. (Tr. 57-\n58)  \n \n \nApplicant has returned to Iraq about six times since arriving in 2009. He went in \n2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. In April 2019, he visited his father whose illness is \nprogressing. Applicant generally stays for at least a month when he returns to Iraq. He \nsaw his siblings and one of his friends while there in April 2019. (Tr. 60-61, 66-68: GE 1) \n \n \nIn the spring of 2019, Applicant stopped communicating on a regular basis with his \ngirlfriend. She is a citizen of Iraq and Norway, and resident of Norway. She visited \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nApplicant in the United States in 2018. (Tr. 27-29) At that time, he told her that he was \napplying for a linguist position and could return to Iraq to work. She does not want him to \ndo that. (Tr. 63-64) \n \n \nApplicant said he would not tell his family or friends if he obtains a linguist position \nand returns to Iraq. He said the area where his family lives is still not safe in terms of the \npresence of terrorists. He does not trust people living there. He stated that some Iraqi \npeople, who had assisted the British army in the past, were subsequently killed. Before \nleaving for the United States in 2009, Applicant received a threatening letter for working \nwith the British army. He told his family about the letter. (Tr. 70-72)  \n \nIraq \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npronouncements concerning the state of Iraq, as outlined in HE 1, including the following: \nIraq faces many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist \ngroups are increasingly active throughout Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIL or Islamic State) controls some of the country\u2019s territory. Threats of kidnapping and \nviolence are high, and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Iraq \nshould \nbe \navoided. \nAdditionally, \nhuman-rights-related \nproblems \nincluding \ndisappearances, torture, denial of fair public trial, and limits on freedom of speech and \nexpression, are present.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nIraq has significant internal anti-western terrorists that operate openly and contrary \nto U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s close connections and visits to his family there \ngenerate significantly heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \nApplicant has ongoing contacts with his parents, seven siblings, and a cousin, who \nare citizens and residents of Iraq. He has visited his family about six times since \nimmigrating to the United States in 2009. He stays at least a month during those visits. \nHe provides some financial support to his elderly parents, and occasionally siblings, when \nneeded. These relationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation because terrorists or insurgents in Iraq engage in behaviors that are hostile \nto the United States\u2019 interests. Applicant\u2019s relationships with family members there create \na potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation or technology and his desire to help family members living in Iraq. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise a disqualification under AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on these facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nConsidered in light of the anti-western insurgent threats in Iraq, Applicant did not \nsufficiently demonstrate that it is unlikely he could be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual or government and those of the \nUnited States due to his family ties in Iraq. In fact, he had previously received a threat for \nhis work with the British army. He has legitimate and appropriately close relationships \nwith those family members and a strong interest in protecting them. His communication \nand contact with them are frequent, ongoing, and not casual. Accordingly, he failed to \nestablish the mitigating conditions set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c). \n \nThe evidence also fails to establish sufficient mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key \nfactor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant has minimal connections to the United States: \nhe arrived in the United States in 2009; he earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2013; he \nbecame a citizen in February 2015, less than five years ago; he owns a home with his \nbrother; and he has worked for U.S. companies since 2010. While these facts \ndemonstrate a growing connection to the United States, they do not outweigh his long \nhistory and ongoing familial relationships in Iraq. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s U.S. ties are so deep and longstanding that he can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest involving his family in Iraq in favor of the U.S. interests. \nAccordingly, he did not mitigate the foreign influence security concerns under this \ncondition. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThe foreign influence security concerns do not arise from any questionable \nconduct by Applicant, but rather circumstances that are normal results of his familial ties. \nThere is no evidence that he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm \nto the United States. However, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nand all pertinent facts and circumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence. The \nsignificant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress remains unmitigated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 8, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. Applicant responded to the SOR on April 5, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 12, 2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non July 23, 2019, scheduling the hearing for September 4, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, \nwhich was admitted without objection. \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2015. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has \nheld for about ten years. He is married with four children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 51-54; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \n \nApplicant attended a religious college from about 2000 to 2005. He received a \ndiploma in general studies. He worked as a manager for a large company from 2000 to \n2004. The company had education programs for their managers that had been \ndeveloped by two prestigious universities. The programs utilized the students\u2019 existing \neducation, employment, and life experience, and developed a curriculum that would \nassist them in their progression in the company. The program from one university \n(University 1) provided the student-employees with the educational equivalent of a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, and the other university\u2019s (University 2) program did the same for a \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Tr. at 17-21, 45-46, 55-59; GE 2) \n \nApplicant completed the first program in 2002 and the second in 2003. He \nreceived certificates, but no actual diploma or degree. He attended another religious \ncollege from 2005 to 2007. He received a master\u2019s degree in 2006 and three doctorates \nin 2006 and 2007. He is currently attending graduate courses online. (Tr. at 20, 30, 31, \n46-50, 55-57; GE 2) \n \nApplicant worked in information technology for a company in May 2010. There \nwere ongoing problems with a delivery company leaving packages without receiving the \nrequired signatures. The delivery company dropped off a package with seven software \ndiscs in May 2015, without obtaining a signature. The value of the seven discs was \n$962. Applicant opened the package in front of another employee and installed one of \nthe discs in a company laptop. He stated that the delivery person scribbled a name on \nthe receipt. He was upset at the delivery company, and made a poor attempt to correct \ntheir behavior. He told the delivery company that they were unable to locate the \npackage. The seller of the software was informed that the package was not delivered \nand replaced the discs. (Tr. at 31-38, 64-69; GE 4) \n \nApplicant did not inform his employer of his actions, and the employer believed \nApplicant stole the discs for his personal use. Applicant was terminated in May 2010. \nHe was charged in July 2010 with the felony offense of embezzlement. He hired an \nattorney. In February 2012, as part of a deferred adjudication, he pleaded guilty to the \nmisdemeanor offense of trespass after having been forbidden. He was fined $250, \nordered to pay $250 court costs, and he completed 100 hours of community service. \n(Tr. at 37-38, 42, 69; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5) \n \nApplicant is remorseful for his conduct. He realizes that his actions were stupid \nand that he completely mishandled the situation. He credibly testified that he never \nintended to steal the discs. He has not been arrested or charged with anything else \nsince the incident. (Tr. at 31-32, 38, 72, 75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant applied for a job in June 2010. He was sensitive about his education, \nand did not know how to report it. He wanted to receive credit for the equivalency \neducation he received from the company in the early 2000s, but he did not want to \nmisrepresent that he had actual degrees from the universities. His resume listed under \n\u201cBachelorette Information\u201d his 2005 and 2006 degrees. Under \u201cGraduate Education and \nOther Education,\u201d he listed \u201cAvailable Upon Request.\u201d He discussed his education with \nthe company, including his attendance at the programs provided by the company he \nworked for in the early 2000s. He had a difficult time explaining the education at his \nhearing. It is likely that he also had difficulty explaining it to his employer. He was hired \nby the company. (Tr. at 22-26; GE 3) \n \n \nIn July 2010, the employer conducted a background check on Applicant. The \nrequest for the background check included the following: \n \nWe would also like to check if he went to [University 1] even though it is \nnot listed on his resume. He is claiming that he went there and has a \ndoctorate. \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he did not tell the employer that he had a \ndoctorate from University 1. He told the employer that he had the equivalent of a \nmaster\u2019s degree from the program created by University 1. The request for a \nbackground investigation does not state that Applicant claimed he had a doctorate from \nUniversity 1. It states that he claimed he went to University 1 and had a doctorate, \nwhich is not the same thing. (Tr. at 27-30, 62-63; GE 6) I find that he was not attempting \nto falsify his educational credentials. \n \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor from 2010 through 2015. He had an \nopportunity to move to his current employer to continue working on a contract. He \nexplained his educational background to the employer, including his equivalency \neducation that he received in the early 2000s. Drafts of his resume went back and forth \nbetween him and the hiring manager, specifically addressing Applicant\u2019s education and \nhow to report his equivalency education. (Tr. at 17, 22-25, 69-70; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A) The resume that was eventually provided to the employer \nincluded the following language in the discussion of his employment from 2000 to 2004: \n \nSelected as 1 of 30 \u201c[Employer] Future Leaders\u201d globally and provided the \nopportunity to participate in pilot undergrad and grad equivalent programs \ndeveloped and administered by [University 1] and [University 2] \n(respectively), resulting in award of degrees for Engineering (BS) and \nBusiness (MBA). \n \nUnder the education section of the resume, Applicant listed his actual undergraduate \nand graduate degrees, and he also listed his equivalency degrees, as follows: \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nBS, Industrial Engineering. 2002 [University 1] (Program designed for \n[Employer] and administered by University staff)  \n \n* \n* \n* \n \nMBA, 2003 [University 2] (Program designed for [Employer] and \nadministered by University staff) \n \n \nThe resume was inaccurate, but Applicant did not intend to misrepresent his \nacademic credentials. The company was completely aware that Applicant did not \nreceive actual degrees from the two universities, and it worked with Applicant on how to \nreport his education on his resume. (Tr. at 17, 22-25, 69-70; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n\n \n6 \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information about his academic \nrecord to employers in 2010 and 2015. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) have not been \nestablished. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are concluded for Applicant.  \n \nApplicant was charged with embezzlement. As part of a deferred adjudication, he \npleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense of trespass after having been forbidden. \nThat conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant is remorseful for his conduct. He realizes that his actions were stupid \nand that he completely mishandled the situation. He credibly testified that he never \nintended to steal the discs. He has not been arrested or charged with anything else \nsince the incident. I find that the conduct is unlikely to recur; it does not cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment; and it no longer \n\n \n7 \n \nserves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are \napplicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Eric A. Eisen, Esq. \n11/13/2019 \n______________\nDecision \n______________\n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant, a dual citizen of the United States (U.S.) and his native Egypt, worked \nfor a defense contractor in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from May 2014 to November \n2016. His parents, one of his brothers, and his grandmother currently reside in Egypt, while \nhis other two siblings are U.S.-Egyptian dual citizens currently residing in the U.S. \nApplicant intends to remain in the U.S. While concerns of foreign preference are mitigated, \nhe does not have such deep and longstanding ties to the U.S. to overcome his close family \nties to Egypt. Foreign influence security concerns persist. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 6, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline C, foreign preference. The \nSOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \n\n \n \n2 \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 30, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nAugust 19, 2019, counsel for Applicant formally entered his appearance. On August 21, \n2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nOn August 28, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for September 25, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) and four Applicant exhibits \n(AEs A-D) were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, as reflected in \na transcript (Tr.) received on October 10, 2019. At the Government\u2019s request and without \nobjection from Applicant, I agreed to take administrative notice of several facts pertinent \nto Egypt and to the UAE, as set forth in respective requests for administrative notice \npertaining to Egypt and the UAE dated July 25, 2019. I informed the parties that after \nreviewing the source material relied on by the Government, I may administratively notice \nadditional facts that I consider to be relevant and material to a timely assessment of the \npolitical landscapes in those countries pursuant to my responsibilities and in accord with \nAppeal Board precedent set forth in ISCR Case No. 05-11292, dated April 12, 2007.  \nApplicant was offered an opportunity to propose facts for administrative notice, which he \ndeclined. The facts administratively noticed are set forth below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s father is a U.S.-Egyptian dual \ncitizen, who resides in the UAE and is employed as a civilian contractor for the UAE \nmilitary (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.b), one of his brothers (SOR \u00b6 1.c), \nand his grandmother (SOR \u00b6 1.g) are U.S.-Egyptian dual citizens residing in Egypt; that \nApplicant\u2019s other brother (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and his sister (SOR \u00b6 1.e) have dual citizenship \nwith Egypt and the U.S.; that Applicant\u2019s cousin is a dual citizen of Egypt and Canada \nresiding in Canada (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that Applicant\u2019s friend is an Egyptian citizen residing \nin the UAE (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Under Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to have expressed \ndivided loyalty between the U.S. and Egypt during his August 8, 2017 security interview \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a), and to have been employed by a foreign defense company that supports \nthe UAE military from about May 2014 to November 2016 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \n \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the Guideline B \nallegations. In a detailed response, he explained that his father had retired two months \nprior from his work as a pediatrician in the UAE and was in the process of returning to \nEgypt. He also indicated that his parents intend to move to the U.S., but currently have \nfamily obligations in Egypt in that Applicant\u2019s mother is his grandmother\u2019s caregiver. \nApplicant stated that his siblings in the U.S. show no interest in moving from the U.S. \nApplicant explained that his friend in the UAE (SOR \u00b6 1.h) is a childhood friend from \nEgypt, but they have no ongoing relationship and have had no direct communication in \nover three years. As for the foreign preference concerns, Applicant denied that he has \n\n \n \n3 \ndivided allegiance. He admitted his previous employment for a defense contractor in the \nUAE, but indicated that his work was not contrary to the interests of the U.S. (Answer.) \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old senior software engineer, who began working for his \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, in December 2016. He subsequently left the \nemployment of the company only to return (Tr. 62, 80), although the dates of his break in \nemployment are not in evidence. \n \nApplicant was born into a well-educated, upper-middle-class Egyptian family. (Tr. \n33-34.) His parents were both physicians then living in their native Egypt. As an officer in \nEgypt\u2019s military, Applicant\u2019s maternal grandfather served a diplomatic posting in the U.S. \nin the late 1970s, and Applicant\u2019s mother attended graduate school in the U.S. (GEs 1-2; \nTr. 55-58.) Applicant\u2019s mother may have acquired her U.S. permanent-residency status \naround that time, although Applicant does not know for certain when she obtained her \n\u201cgreen card.\u201d (Tr. 30.) \n \n \nIn early summer 1986, Applicant moved with his parents and his then only sibling, \na brother born in 1984, to the UAE for his father\u2019s job at a UAE military hospital. (GE 2.)  \nOn a date not clear in the record, his mother became employed at the same hospital. (Tr. \n27.) Within a few years of their move, Applicant\u2019s parents had two more children: a \ndaughter born in Egypt in 1988, and a son born in the UAE in 1990. (GE 1.) \n \n \n \nApplicant attended private school in the UAE where the instruction was in the \nGerman language. (Tr. 25.) In 1995, when Applicant was nine or ten years old, his mother \nresigned from her employment in the UAE and moved with her children back to Egypt. \nApplicant\u2019s father stayed in the UAE working as a pediatrician. Applicant\u2019s mother \nbecame a medical professor at an Egyptian university. (GE 2; Tr. 27.) Applicant\u2019s friends \nwere of the same social and economic class as he in Egypt\u2019s segmented society. (Tr. 33-\n34.) \n \n \nApplicant and his family went to the UAE, about twice yearly during month-long \nschool breaks, to visit his father. During his childhood, Applicant also visited the U.S. a \nfew times. (GE 2.) After the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, Applicant\u2019s parents \nbecame naturalized in the U.S. Applicant asserts that he and his siblings obtained U.S. \ncitizenship as minors through their mother, and that he became a U.S. citizen in \nDecember 2001. (Tr. 31-32.) \n \n \nApplicant attended college in Egypt from September 2004 to July 2009. For a \ncouple of weeks in summer 2009, Applicant visited his father in the UAE. His father was \nemployed by a company contracted to provide medical services for the UAE military. (AE \nB.) In August 2009, Applicant came to the U.S. for graduate school. He was 23 years old \nand had dual citizenship with the U.S. and Egypt. He did not register with the U.S. \nSelective Service because he was unaware of the requirement. (GE 2; Tr. 59-60.) He \n\n \n \n4 \nspent the holiday break from December 2009 to January 2010 and the summer break \nfrom June 2010 to August 2010 in Egypt. He earned his master\u2019s degree in December \n2010 in signals processing and artificial intelligence. (GE 1; Tr. 43.) Applicant went to \nEgypt for a month in early 2011 and then returned to the U.S. to seek employment. \nApplicant renewed his U.S. passport in January 2011 for another ten years. He used his \nU.S. passport for foreign travel, including on several trips to Egypt. Applicant also held an \nEgyptian passport until 2012. (GEs 1-2.) \n \n \nFrom June 2011 to May 2014, Applicant was employed as a software-development \nengineer for a small start-up communications company in the U.S. While in that job, he \nsubmitted his Egyptian passport to his employer to obtain a clearance and was apparently \ntold his passport would be shredded. He does not know whether it was destroyed. (GE \n2.) After over two years in the job, Applicant began a job search for financial and career \ndevelopment reasons. He concentrated on jobs in the U.S., but after his father passed \naround his resume in the UAE, he received and accepted a lucrative job offer in the UAE \nat double his then salary and tax free. (Tr. 45).  \n \n \nIn May 2014, Applicant moved to the UAE for a job as a network security engineer \nwith a UAE-based contractor that provided human resources services for the UAE \nmilitary. To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, the UAE government and not a corporate board made \nthe decisions for the company. (Tr. 79-80.) Applicant\u2019s duty location was on a military \nbase in the UAE, and he worked on unclassified projects. Applicant lived with his father \nrent free. Under the sponsorship of the UAE-based company, Applicant obtained a UAE \nresident permit that was valid from May 2014 to May 2016. He renewed the resident \npermit in May 2018, but it was cancelled in November 2016, when he left the UAE for the \nU.S. (GEs 1-2.) Applicant met an American woman in the UAE with whom he began a \nrelationship that led him, along with a desire to start a new life here, to return to the U.S. \nThey dated for awhile in the U.S. but eventually grew apart. (Tr. 45-47.) \n \n \nIn early December 2016, Applicant began working for his current employer in the \nU.S. He was placed on a program that was understaffed, and according to Applicant, his \nproductivity saved the company \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d (Tr. 74.) \n \n \nOn December 8, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed that he holds dual \ncitizenship with Egypt and the U.S., and explained the he was naturalized in the U.S. \nthrough his mother. He added that he obtained his U.S. passport in December 2001 and \nthat he currently held only his U.S. passport, having \u201csubmitted\u201d his Egyptian passport to \na previous employer to obtain a security clearance in 2012. Under both the employment \nand foreign military service sections, Applicant listed his employment with the UAE-based \ncontractor from May 2014 to November 2016 on a UAE military base. He explained that \nhe worked as a contractor in an information technology division of the UAE military where \nhe \u201cwas responsible for providing Information Security recommendations and Systems \narchitectures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of UAE [military] \ncomputer systems.\u201d (GE 1.) \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \nApplicant disclosed the Egyptian-U.S. dual citizenship of his parents and siblings. \nHe detailed that he had contact by telephone or electronic means (including online video \nchat) weekly with his father in the UAE and daily with his mother in Egypt; quarterly \ncontact with his brother in Egypt; and contact by telephone or electronic means (texting) \ndaily with his brother and weekly with his sister in the U.S. In response to an inquiry into \nany close or continuing contacts with other foreign nationals in the last seven years with \nwhom he was bound by affection, influence, common interest, or obligation, Applicant \nreported that he has averaged weekly contact by telephone or text with a cousin with \nCanadian-Egyptian dual citizenship residing in Canada. Applicant listed his foreign travel \nin the last seven years, including to Egypt while he was living in the UAE to visit family or \nfriends in September 2014, May 2015, July 2015, July 2016, and October 2016. (GE 1.) \n \n \nOn August 8, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that he acquired his U.S. \ncitizenship and passport in 2001, even though he continued to live in Egypt until August \n2009. Applicant stated that he has considered the U.S. his home since coming here in \n2009 for graduate school. Applicant explained that, because he earned his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree from an accredited engineering program in Egypt he is eligible for an Egyptian \npension of less than $30 per month when he eventually retires. He denied ever voting in \nan Egyptian election, any employment in Egypt, and any service in Egypt\u2019s military, \nexplaining that his status as a dual citizen with the U.S. disqualified him from Egypt\u2019s \nmilitary-service requirement. About his dual passports, Applicant could not recall whether \nhe had used his first U.S. passport issued in 2001, as he would have used his Egyptian \npassport when he was living in Egypt, but he asserted that he used his U.S. passport \nexclusively since August 2009. He denied any intention to reapply for an Egyptian \npassport. When asked where his ultimate loyalty lies, Applicant responded that his loyalty \nis to his work, and because he studied in the U.S. and his career is here, his loyalty is to \nthe U.S., i.e., he finds value in his work, and he is loyal to his employer in performing his \njob with quality. (Tr. 66-67.) He acknowledged that it was hard to say where his loyalty \nlies, because he had not lived in any one place for a long time. However, he expressed a \nsense of belonging in the U.S.; that his \u201cconcepts and work ethic\u201d align with the U.S. \nApplicant denied any sense of obligation to any foreign country, including Egypt, but \nadmitted he is tied to his family in Egypt. (GE 2.)  He testified that he would not divulge \nany sensitive information regarding his work for the U.S. military without proper approval. \n(Tr. 67.) \n \n \nAbout his work as a contractor for the UAE military on a UAE military base, \nApplicant explained that he had \u201cconstant contact\u201d with foreign government and military \nemployees, but his interactions with them were solely professional. He had both military \nand civilian supervisors. (Tr. 64-65.) Although the UAE government investigated his \nbackground for an identity card to enter the military installation and to grant him the UAE \nequivalent of a security clearance, he did not handle any classified information in his work. \nHe told the OPM investigator that he left the job in the UAE, which paid him $140,000 a \nyear, because he disliked the attitude among workers to take it easy and not work very \nhard. He closed a bank account that he had in UAE when he left the country and \ntransferred $180,000 to $190,000 to the U.S. While Applicant was living in the UAE, he \n\n \n \n6 \nmainly socialized with his father and with a group of friends from the U.S. whom he met \nin the UAE, including his then girlfriend. Applicant updated his foreign travel since \ncompleting his SF 86, disclosing that he had traveled with his girlfriend to Iceland for \ntourism in January 2017 and to Canada to visit his cousin in May 2017. Applicant denied \nany unusual encounters during any of his international travels. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant emailed the OPM investigator a copy of all of the pages of his U.S. \npassport issued in January 2011. The passport bore stamps that confirmed that he used \nhis U.S. passport for his international travel, including to enter and exit the UAE on various \ndates between May 2014 and December 2015. As of August 2017, his U.S. passport \ncontained 11 arrival stamps and nine departure stamps for Egypt. (GE 2.) Applicant \ntraveled to Egypt most recently for three weeks in March 2019, using his U.S. passport. \n(Tr. 72.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s employment contract with the UAE-based company expired on \nJanuary 1, 2018, but his residency permit in the UAE was renewed to maintain \ncontinuation of service in the UAE through March 24, 2019. On February 27, 2019, the \nUAE-based company reconfirmed the termination of his employment contract due to a \nrestructuring. Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s \u201cLabour Card,\u201d which was issued to him as a U.S. \npassport holder and which authorized his employment in the UAE, was cancelled, and \nhis employment ended on March 24, 2019. Applicant\u2019s father currently holds a U.S. \npassport issued in December 2011 that is valid for ten years. (AE B.) Applicant\u2019s father \nmoved back to Egypt sometime between late May 2019 and September 2019. (Tr. 36.) \nApplicant has had weekly contact on average with his father, although their contact has \nbeen less frequent lately. (Tr. 70.) \n  \n \nApplicant has daily contact with his mother, and monthly to once every two months \ncontact with his grandmother, who \u201cdivides her time up on 22 cousins.\u201d (Tr. 71-72.) \nApplicant testified that his parents intend to retire to the U.S., but his mother currently is \nthe primary caregiver for her mother in Egypt. (Answer; Tr. 37-38.) The record does not \nindicate whether Applicant\u2019s mother is retired from her position as a university professor. \nApplicant\u2019s parents, grandmother, and his mother\u2019s sisters all live in the same building in \nEgypt. (Tr. 33, 37-38.) Applicant\u2019s mother spent two to three months in the U.S. in 2017, \napproximately six months in 2018, and four to five months in 2019. (Tr. 39.) She stays \nwith Applicant when she is in the U.S. (Tr. 76.) His father came to the U.S. in 2018 for \nabout a month. (Tr. 40, 77.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother attended an American high school in Egypt. He obtained \nhis college degree in Egypt and initially worked as a construction engineer. (Tr. 29, 35.) \nHe quit his job and was unemployed for about two years. At least part of that time, \nApplicant\u2019s father was home in Egypt and not working overseas. (Tr. 36.) Applicant\u2019s \nbrother became a software engineer. As of September 2019, Applicant\u2019s brother was \nworking in the information-technology sector in Egypt and living with Applicant\u2019s parents. \n(Tr. 36.) Applicant is in contact with his brother a few times every couple of months. (Tr. \n71.) \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother has resided in the U.S. continuously since 2009, and \nhe works in the financial industry. Applicant\u2019s sister is currently employed as a data \nanalyst for an insurance company in the U.S. She earned her master\u2019s degree in statistical \nmodeling in the U.S. in 2018. Applicant visits his siblings in the U.S. whenever he can. \n(GE 2; Tr. 34-35.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin in Canada had owned an electronics shop, but as of August \n2017, he was starting an online sales business. Applicant sees his cousin about twice a \nyear in person, and has averaged weekly contact with him by phone or text. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s childhood friend from Egypt has been a longtime resident of the UAE. \nApplicant and his friend had regular contact in childhood but sporadic contact thereafter \nuntil Applicant moved to the UAE in 2014. This friend, who worked for a U.S.-based \ncompany in the UAE, socialized with Applicant three or four times in the UAE. They have \nhad no contact other than a single text message since Applicant returned to the U.S. in \n2016. (GE 2.) \n                     \n \nAfter the SOR was issued, Applicant was removed from his program at work in \nMay 2019 and transferred to unclassified work. (Tr. 75.) On May 30, 2019, Applicant \nexecuted a written statement of loyalty to the U.S. in which he renounced any allegiance \nto a foreign state. (AE A.) He denied any loyalty to Egypt, although there is no evidence \nthat Applicant has notified Egyptian authorities of an intention to relinquish his Egyptian \ncitizenship. In response to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged his concern for his \nimmediate family, but indicated: \n \nRespectfully, if the remote and speculative possibility of my being placed in \na position of choosing between Egypt and the U.S. there is no choice; I \nwould have no loyalty to Egypt. I proudly admit I would have concern for my \nclose family and think that if I did not, well that might be the greater concern \nwith respect to who I am. But short of even more remote scenarios of \nkidnappings etc., I just don\u2019t see how that would happen given who they are \nand their lack of knowledge of my job responsibilities. If it did, I would rely \non the systems and process of the government I have sworn to protect to \ndo what must be done. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant does not see a future for himself in Egypt, largely because of the rampant \ncorruption there. (Tr. 41-42.) When asked at his hearing whether he would consider \nmoving to Egypt or the UAE for a job, Applicant responded, as follows: \n \nDoubt it. . . . because I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t need to. I, the job market\u2019s great, \nhere, right now . . . it will just be another source of instability. And I wouldn\u2019t \nknow where I would end up next in my life, but most likely, here. I wouldn\u2019t \n\u2014 unless i got another great job offer in the UAE that pays, somehow, but I \ndon\u2019t see that happening. (Tr. 77-78.) \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial assets, including about $47,000 in banking deposits, $16,538 \nin his employer\u2019s investment plan, and $213,000 in other retirement and investment \naccounts, are solely in the U.S. (AE C; Tr. 50.) Applicant consulted with a real estate \nprofessional in his area in regard to purchasing a residence, but he continues to rent \nbecause of the uncertainty about his clearance and possible job loss. (AE C; Tr. 51-52.) \nFor the last year, he has assisted his sister while she was having chemotherapy \ntreatments. Applicant has been dating a medical student for the past year-and-a half. (Tr. \n53.) \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted character reference letters on his behalf from a friend, two co-\nworkers, and a neighbor. The friend has known Applicant for the last five years. They first \nbecame acquainted in November 2014, while she was employed as a special education \nteacher in the UAE. Applicant was someone she looked to for advice and guidance in \nnavigating in the UAE and its culture. She returned to the U.S. in August 2016. When \nApplicant moved back to the U.S., he stayed in this friend\u2019s guest room while apartment \nhunting. He paid his bills on time. This friend considers Applicant to be a sincere, \nthoughtful, and dependable friend. (AE D.) \n \n \nA software engineer for Applicant\u2019s employer met Applicant two years ago. They \ndid not work on the same projects, but they share similar work and sports (soccer) \ninterests. They have contact outside of work a couple of times per week. This friend/co-\nworker is aware that Applicant\u2019s sister underwent chemotherapy treatments; that \nApplicant assumed the responsibility of caring for her without hesitation or complaint; and \nthat Applicant provides emotional support for his mother. According to this friend, \nApplicant stands out for his empathy, responsibility, and reliability. He has no hesitation \nin recommending Applicant for a position that requires integrity and reliability. (AE D.) \n \n \nA senior software engineer with a secret clearance met Applicant in November \n2017 when the co-worker began working for Applicant\u2019s employer. Applicant \u201cwent out of \nhis way to help [him] and make sure things went smoothly.\u201d While they were assigned to \nthe same team, Applicant handled some of the most difficult problems professionally and \nwith success. This co-worker described Applicant as an asset to their work and to the \nsoccer team that they joined together in 2018. Applicant attended his wedding, and this \nco-worker and his wife have developed a close friendship with Applicant. They have \nlearned through experience that Applicant is a thoughtful and sincere person. (AE D.) \n \n \nA neighbor of Applicant\u2019s attests that Applicant has been a consistently polite, \nthoughtful, and kind neighbor. The neighbor and her spouse have had the pleasure of \nmeeting Applicant\u2019s sister and mother when they have visited him, although their \ninteractions with them have been limited to small, polite conversations. The neighbor \nbelieves Applicant can be relied on to abide by his commitments. (AE D.) \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAfter reviewing the source documents relied on by the Government, and \nconsidering Applicant\u2019s position about issues in Egypt, including that known terrorist \nactivity targeting tourists in Egypt \u201chas less than nothing to do with this case\u201d (Tr. 16), I \nhave taken administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Government\u2019s July 25, 2019 \nrequests and incorporate them by reference in this decision. For additional background \ninformation regarding the two countries relationships with the U.S., I have reviewed the \nU.S. State Department\u2019s respective Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, issued for Egypt on \nSeptember 20, 2019, and for the UAE on September 13, 2018. Of particular note are the \nfollowing salient facts. \n \n \nEgypt is a constitutional republic governed by an elected president and unicameral \nlegislature. Challengers to Egypt\u2019s incumbent President al-Sisi withdrew before recent \npresidential elections in March 2019, some citing political pressure or unfair competition. \nSome challengers were arrested for alleged violations of candidacy prohibitions for \nmilitary personnel. Domestic and international organizations expressed concern that \ngovernment limitations on association, assembly, and expression severely constrained \nbroad participation in the political process. Egypt\u2019s parliament approved a state of \nemergency after an April 2017 terrorist attack on Coptic churches. Egypt was under a \ngovernment-declared state of emergency for all of 2018. Illegal demonstrations have \noccurred in Egypt which have turned volatile. The U.S. State Department\u2019s Office of \nDiplomatic Security\u2019s Egypt 2019 Crime & Safety Report: Cairo indicates that illegal \ndemonstrations have been quashed by Egyptian authorities in a relatively short time, but \nthat, because of the volatility of past demonstrations, peaceful demonstrators and even \nbystanders may be subject to questioning, detention, arrest, and conviction for \nparticipating in or proximity to unauthorized demonstrations.   \n \n \nIn 2018, Egypt\u2019s most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful \nkillings, including by government forces or its agents and non-state terrorist groups; \nforced disappearances; torture, arbitrary arrest and detention; arbitrary or unlawful \ninterference with privacy; undue restrictions on free expression, the press, and the \nInternet; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of \nassociation; restrictions on political participation; and arbitrary arrest and targeting of \nLGBT persons and other minority groups. Government officials enjoyed a measure of \nimpunity for human rights abuses. \n \n \nIn 2017 and 2018, terrorist organizations, including some affiliates of the self-\nproclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group, carried out deadly attacks on government, \ncivilian, and security targets in Egypt, including on places of worship. While Egyptian \nauthorities investigated terrorist attacks and prosecuted alleged perpetrators, the U.S. \nState Department\u2019s current travel advisory for Egypt is Level 2 \u2013 exercise increased \ncaution \u2013 due to terrorism. U.S. citizens are advised against travel to the Sinai Peninsula \n(with the exception of travel to Sharm El-Sheikh by air) or the Western Desert due to \nterrorism. The U.S. warns that terrorist groups may attack with little or no warning, \ntargeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets or shopping malls, and local \n\n \n \n10 \ngovernment facilities, and that there is a considerable risk of terrorist attacks in urban \nareas, including Cairo, despite a heavy security presence. On May 20, 2019, the U.S. \nState Department issued a security alert on reports of a roadside bomb attack on a tourist \nbus resulting in injuries in the area of the museum complex near the pyramids in Giza. \nCairo is reported to be at considerable risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe U.S. seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Egypt. Promoting a \nstable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects the basic rights of its citizens, \ncontinues to be a core objective of U.S. policy. Since 1980, the U.S. has provided Egypt \nwith over $40 billion in military assistance in furthering the strategic partnership and \nregional stability, and $30 billion in economic assistance. Two-way trade in goods \nbetween the U.S. and Egypt totaled $7.5 billion in 2018. American firms are active in most \nsectors of Egypt\u2019s economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, financial \nservices, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications, information technology, and \nthe restaurant and hospitality industry. Egypt and the U.S. belong to some of the same \ninternational organizations, such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, \nWorld Bank, and World Trade Organization. \n \n \nThe UAE is a federation of seven semi-autonomous emirates, six of which merged \nto form the UAE in 1971. A seventh emirate joined in 1972. The rulers of the seven \nemirates constitute the Federal Supreme Council, the UAE\u2019s highest legislative and \nexecutive body. The emirates are under patriarchal rule with political allegiance defined \nby loyalty to tribal leaders, leaders of the individual emirates, and leaders of the \nfederation. A limited, appointed electorate participates in periodic elections for a partially \nelected Federal National Council, which has legislative review authority.  \n \n \nSignificant human rights abuses in the UAE in 2018 included allegations of torture \nin detention, arbitrary arrest and detention by government agents; government \ninterference with privacy rights; undue restrictions on free expression and the press, \nincluding censorship; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and \nfreedom of association; and the inability of citizens to choose their government in free \nand fair elections. The government did not permit workers to join independent unions and \ndid not effectively prevent physical and sexual abuse of foreign domestic servants and \nother domestic workers. \n \n \nIn 2015, the UAE became part of a Saudi-led coalition to counter the 2014 \noverthrow of the legitimate government in Yemen by militias and other forces loyal to the \nformer Yemeni president. In 2018, UAE forces continued an active military role in Yemen \nand UAE forces allegedly abducted, detained, and tortured individuals as part of \ncounterterrorism efforts in southern Yemen. \n \n \nThe UAE is a vocal and active participant in counterterrorism efforts at both the \nregional and international levels. Terrorist organizations exploited the UAE\u2019s position as \na regional and global financial and transportation hub in 2017. Except for well-regulated \nfree trade zones specifically established for financial activities, free trade zones varied in \ntheir compliance with and supervision of anti-money laundering and countering the \n\n \n \n11 \nfinancing of terrorism international best practices. Exploitation by illicit actors of money \ntransmitters remained a significant concern. Between 2005 and 2016, several companies \nand individuals have shipped restricted U.S. goods, dual-use, military and electronic \ncomponents and Internet technology through the UAE and UAE-owned businesses to \nIran and Syria in violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions regulations. \n \n \nLaw enforcement in the UAE has effectively demonstrated the capacity to detect, \ndeter, and prevent terrorism in the UAE. The U.S. State Department\u2019s current travel \nadvisory for the UAE is Level 1 \u2013 exercise normal precautions, although U.S. citizens in \nthe UAE are advised to exercise a high level of security awareness because of the \npossibility of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and interests in the Gulf and Arabian \nPeninsula. Terrorist organizations continue to plan attacks against Western targets, using \na variety to tactics, including suicide operations, assassination, kidnapping, hijacking, and \nbombing. Rebel groups in Yemen have expressed an intention to attack neighboring \ncountries, including the UAE, using missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones). U.S. \ncitizens are encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance in the UAE. \n \n  \nThe UAE plays an influential role in the Middle East and is a key partner for the \nU.S. in the region. The U.S. and the UAE enjoy strong bilateral cooperation on a full range \nof issues, including defense, nuclear non-proliferation, trade, law enforcement, energy \npolicy, and cultural exchange. The UAE hosts more U.S. Navy ships than any other \nforeign country, and the U.S. provides export and border security assistance to the UAE. \nMore than 1,000 U.S. firms operate in the UAE and many use the UAE as its regional \nheadquarters from which to conduct business throughout the Middle East, North Africa, \nand parts of Asia. The UAE and the U.S. belong to some of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, \nand World Trade Organization. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n \n12 \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, maternal grandmother, and older brother are currently \nresidents of their native Egypt. His parents and sibling have dual citizenship with the U.S. \nand Egypt while his grandmother is an Egyptian citizen. Applicant\u2019s other siblings are dual \ncitizens of the U.S. and Egypt currently living and working in the U.S. Among Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n13 \nmany cousins, the SOR alleges foreign influence concerns only about a cousin with \nCanadian-Egyptian dual citizenship residing in Canada. \n \nA person is not automatically disqualified from holding a security clearance \nbecause he has relatives or friends living in a foreign country. Contacts and connections \nto foreign citizens are potentially disqualifying if they present a heightened risk under AG \n\u00b6 7(a) or create a potential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying \nconditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family \nties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, \nits relationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in \nassessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States. Moreover, in considering the nature of the foreign government, the \nadministrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. \nSee generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). A heightened level \nof scrutiny is warranted when an applicant has a close relationship with relatives who \nreside in a country where elements hostile to the United States and its interests operate \nsomewhat freely. See generally ISCR Case No. 12-05092 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2017.) \n \nAlleged foreign influence concerns related to the UAE have largely been overcome \nby Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s retirement from his employment in the UAE and his return to Egypt, \nalthough foreign influence concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s ties to Egypt persist. \nThere is no ongoing relationship between Applicant and his childhood friend who resides \nin the UAE. Applicant\u2019s contact with this friend since November 2016 has been limited to \na text message. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual \nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence \nor exploitation,\u201d applies in mitigation of this relationship. \n \nEgypt is not known to target the U.S. for classified information or to conduct \nintelligence operations against the U.S. or its citizens. The two countries have traditionally \n\n \n \n14 \nhad close ties, and promoting a stable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects \nthe basic rights of its citizens, continues to be a core objective of U.S. policy. Since 1980, \nthe U.S. has provided Egypt with over $40 billion in military assistance in furthering the \nstrategic partnership and regional stability, and $30 billion in economic assistance. \nNonetheless, a heightened risk exists because of the closeness of Applicant\u2019s family ties; \nEgypt\u2019s uneven human rights record; and the documented safety issues for residents of \nEgypt because of terrorism. It is unclear whether his mother, a medical professor at an \nEgyptian university, was or is employed directly by the Egyptian government. Nothing \nabout her career in Egypt had military, security, or intelligence implications, and there is \nno evidence that his mother was or is politically involved. Her position as an academic \nand medical professional makes it more, rather than less, likely that she would be known \nto the Egyptian authorities. However, the issue under Guideline B is not whether an \napplicant\u2019s immediate family members in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign \ngovernment or entity based on their prominence or personal situation. The issue is \nwhether an applicant\u2019s foreign ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a \nforeign power or terrorists could seek to exploit in an effort to obtain unauthorized access \nto classified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 03-24933 (App. Bd. July 28, \n2005). \n \nIt is conceivable that undue influence or pressure could be brought to bear on \nApplicant through his understandably close ties to his immediate family. Applicant has \ndaily contact with his mother, and she stays with him in his apartment for months at a time \nwhen she is in the U.S. Applicant is known to provide emotional support for his mother. \nApplicant has averaged weekly contact with his father. Applicant lived with his father rent \nfree while working in the UAE. Applicant has monthly contact or less with his grandmother \nand older brother in Egypt, but he sees them when he is in Egypt, including as recently \nas March 2019. Furthermore, there exists an indirect risk of undue foreign influence \nbecause of his grandmother\u2019s and brother\u2019s ties to his parents.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \n \nConcerning his siblings in the U.S., Applicant tries to see them when he can. He \nhas almost daily contact with his brother. He cared for his sister while she was undergoing \nchemotherapy treatments. As dual citizens living in the U.S., there is little risk that they \ncan be directly pressured, but there is a possibility of undue foreign influence through \nthem and their concern for their parents, grandmother, and brother living in Egypt. A \nheightened risk was not established by Applicant\u2019s cousin in Canada, who enjoys the \nprotections of Canadian citizenship and residency. Applicant has visited his cousin in \nCanada, and they have ongoing contact that has varied from weekly to no contact for \nmonths. However, there is nothing about their relationship or his cousin\u2019s situation that \nsuggests it could be a source of undue influence or pressure for Applicant. \n \nApplicant has a significant burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he cannot be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and a desire to assist his immediate family \nmembers. AG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n\n \n \n15 \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply because the foreign persons involved are immediate \nfamily with whom Applicant has close bonds of affection if not also obligation; there is a \nsignificant threat of terrorist activity everywhere in Egypt, including in urban areas such \nas Cairo; and there are ongoing human rights problems in Egypt. The risk of any of his \nfamily members being kidnapped may be remote, but the country has been under a \nrenewed state of emergency since 2017 because of terrorist attacks. Illegal \ndemonstrations in Egypt have turned volatile, and even bystanders may be subject to \nquestioning, \ndetention, \narrest \nand \nconviction \nfor \nproximity \nto \nunauthorized \ndemonstrations. Applicant last visited his family in Egypt in March 2019, and he has not \nexpressed an intention to avoid future travel to Egypt. There is no indication that he or his \nfamily members have ever been targeted, but the possibility cannot be ruled out. \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the U.S. As noted by \nthe Appeal Board, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. See ISCR Case \nNo. 02-22461 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005). \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(b), Applicant\u2019s loyalty or obligation to Egypt appears to be \nminimal, despite his dual citizenship with Egypt and the fact that he was raised there from \nabout age nine through undergraduate school. Applicant credibly denies loyalty to Egypt \nor its institutions. He expressed a particular dislike for the endemic corruption and other \nsocietal issues that hinder opportunity and progress in Egypt. Yet it is difficult to conclude \nthat the bonds of affection and obligation to his immediate family are similarly so minimal \nto satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b), which provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nRegarding whether Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of \nthe U.S. interest, his U.S. citizenship was obtained through his mother when he was a \nteenager living in Egypt and was not sought voluntarily. After earning his master\u2019s degree, \nhe elected to remain in the U.S. for work. When he began working for the start-up in the \nU.S. in June 2011, he was 25 years old. He failed to register with the U.S. Selective \nService, even though he was legally required to do so. He was apparently unaware of the \nrequirement before he moved back to the United States from the UAE at age 29, but it is \na reflection of his limited ties to the U.S. at that time. \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant executed a statement of loyalty to the U.S. \nconsistent with the U.S. oath of naturalization. His professed loyalty to the U.S. weighs \n\n \n \n16 \nfavorably under AG \u00b6 8(b), but it has to be considered in light of other evidence in the \nrecord. In May 2014, he left his job in the U.S. and moved to the UAE for a position with \na UAE defense contractor on a UAE military base. He used his U.S. passport for his \nforeign travel from the UAE, including to Egypt, but he also remained in the UAE until \nNovember 2016. He returned to the U.S. because of a romantic relationship with an \nAmerican that in the end did not work out, but also because his work ethic was more in \nline with the U.S. Intending to remain in the U.S., he looked into buying a home, but \ncontinues to rent because of the uncertainty of his clearance eligibility and its impact on \nhis employment. When asked at his hearing whether he would be willing to move back to \nthe UAE or Egypt for work, Applicant did not see a need to do so because of the job \nmarket in the U.S., but he could not rule out returning to the UAE if \u201c[he] got another job \noffer in the UAE that pays, somehow.\u201d A speculative consideration that he might again \nwork abroad does not indicate disloyalty to the U.S., but it reflects that his ties to the U.S. \nare somewhat tenuous and not so deep and longstanding to overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns. All of his financial assets are presently in the U.S., but it is \nnot enough to overcome the foreign influence security concerns raised by his close family \nrelationships in Egypt. \n \nGuideline C: Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to foreign preference are articulated in AG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself, the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the U.S. by expressing divided loyalty between the U.S. and Egypt during \nhis August 2017 interview with the OPM investigator, and by working for a UAE-based \ndefense contractor in support of the UAE military from May 2014 to November 2016. The \nevidence falls short of establishing that Applicant prefers Egypt over the U.S. or that his \nloyalties are divided between the two countries. When asked by the OPM investigator \nwhere his ultimate loyalty lies, Applicant responded that he is loyal to his work; that his \ncareer is in the U.S. and his loyalty is to the U.S. He expressed a preference for the U.S. \nas a government, country, and system, but then added that it was hard to say where his \nloyalty is because he had not lived in any one country for any length of time. To the extent \nthat this could be construed as an expression of divided loyalty, it is not \u201can act of \nexpatriation from the United States such as declaration of intent to renounce U.S. \n\n \n \n17 \ncitizenship, whether through words or actions,\u201d that would implicate disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 10(f). \n \nApplicant\u2019s apparent surrender of his Egyptian passport to a former employer to \ncomply with DOD requirements; his use of his U.S. passport for all international travel in \nrecent years, including to enter and exit Egypt on multiple occasions; and he expressed \nwillingness to renounce his Egyptian citizenship, indicate a current preference for the U.S. \nThere is no indication that Applicant has formally applied to renounce his Egyptian \ncitizenship, but there is also no evidence that he is actively exercising his Egyptian \ncitizenship, which he acquired by his birth in that country. He has never worked in Egypt \nor voted in Egypt. There was no showing that his Egyptian citizenship is in conflict with \nU.S. national security interests. Three mitigating conditions apply in whole or in part with \nregard to foreign preference security concerns involving Egypt: \n \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; and \n \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. security interests. \n \nApplicant is loyal to his family in Egypt, but those security concerns are more appropriately \naddressed under Guideline B. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment in information technology as a contractor for the UAE\u2019s \nmilitary from May 2014 to November 2016 could raise issues of possible foreign \npreference under Guideline C when it is in conflict with the U.S. national interest or there \nhas been an effort to conceal that foreign employment. Applicant candidly disclosed his \nemployment in the UAE on his SF 86, during his subject interview, and at his hearing. He \nindicated on his SF 86 that he worked as a contractor in an information technology division \nof the UAE military where he \u201cwas responsible for providing Information Security \nrecommendations and Systems architectures to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and \navailability of UAE [military] computer systems.\u201d  His employment as a defense contractor \nfor the UAE military triggers disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10(d), which provides: \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of \nemployment, position, or political office in a foreign \ngovernment or military organization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts \nwith U.S. national security interests. \n\n \n \n18 \nWhen a disqualifying condition is established, the Directive presumes there is a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct or circumstances and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. See ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). Review of the facts in \nevidence about Applicant\u2019s employment for the UAE military are warranted to determine \nwhether they satisfy any or all of the two mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 that could \npotentially apply: \n \n(f) the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, entity, or \nassociation that poses a low national security risk; or \n \n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or \nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. \nlaw. \n \nThere is no indication that Applicant\u2019s employment in the UAE was with U.S. \nconsent or authorization. There are widely documented safety issues regarding the UAE \nprimarily because of terrorism and insurgents, including from terrorist groups in Yemen \nthat target the UAE. However, it was not established that Applicant\u2019s employment in the \nUAE was contrary to U.S. interests or in conflict with U.S. interests. The UAE plays an \ninfluential role in the Middle East and is a key partner for the U.S. in the region. The U.S. \nand the UAE enjoy strong bilateral cooperation on a full range of issues, including \ndefense, nuclear non-proliferation, trade, law enforcement, energy policy, and cultural \nexchange. The UAE hosts more U.S. Navy ships than any other foreign country, and the \nU.S. provides export and border security assistance to the UAE. Applicant\u2019s work in \ninformation technology was in the human resources area and did not involve classified \nmatters. Although he speculated that he would consider a job in the UAE if it was \nfinancially lucrative, his preference is to remain employed in the U.S. where his work ethic \nis more aligned. AG \u00b6 11(f) applies. The foreign preference security concerns are \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d), which are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n19 \n  \nFurthermore, in weighing these whole-person factors in a foreign influence case, \nthe Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nApplicant has no control over his parents\u2019 decision to stay in Egypt to care for his \ngrandmother or over his older brother\u2019s choice to pursue his life in Egypt. He indicated in \nresponse to the SOR that his family members lack knowledge of his job responsibilities. \nIn the event of any attempt at undue influence, Applicant stated that in the remote \nscenario that his relatives would be subjected to undue foreign influence or pressure, he \nwould \u201crely on the systems and process of the government.\u201d Applicant is credited with \nreporting his foreign contacts on his SF 86, and in the case of his grandmother, to the \nOPM investigator. Applicant is known to be a person of integrity among his friends, \nincluding two friends who also work for his employer. There is nothing untoward about his \ncontacts with his family members. The close bonds he shares with family members are \nevident in his care for his sister during her illness and his emotional support for his mother. \nHis present circumstances are such that he could be placed in an untenable position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a loved one and the U.S. As stated by the \nDOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication \nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an \nacknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that \ncould be important to a loved-one, such as a family member.\u201d  Based on the facts and \ncircumstances before me, concerns of undue foreign influence persist. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n20 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 16, 2018. On \nMarch 21, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines J and H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. On June 3, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a complete \ncopy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified \nas Items 1 through 5. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 11, 2019, and did not respond. \n1 \n\nItems 1 through 3 are the pleadings in the case. Items 4 through 5 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on August 7, 2019. \nFindings of Fact \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted the below findings of fact from Applicant's SOR answer (Item 3) and SCA (Item \n4). \nApplicant, age 18, is unmarried without children. He graduated high school in June \n2018. He attended college part time between July 2017 and September 2018, and has \nbeen attending full time since September 2018. He has been employed by a federal \ncontractor as a cyber-security trainee since July 2018. This is his first application for a \nsecurity clearance. \nThe SOR alleged the following under Guideline J: \"You consume alcohol other \nthan that provided by a parent, and other than that at a parent's residence, in violation of \n[state law].\" In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the allegation. Because the \nGovernment did not specify a citation or provide documents referencing the state law \nalleged, I sua sponte confirmed that, while there is a criminal code section under \napplicable state law prohibiting underage consumption of alcohol as alleged in the SOR, \nviolation of that section is a civil offense, not a crime. (\u00a7 10-114 and\u00a7 10-119). \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant \"used and purchased \nmarijuana with varying frequency, from about 2014 to about June 2018.\" Applicant \nadmitted the allegation, with the following comment: \nThese uses are past occurrences and will not happen again. Some even \ndate back to freshman year of high school, when one can be very easily \ninfluenced. I believe that I have changed and matured since, and these past \nuses would not affect my current ability to be trusted. \nIn his 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the following facts in response to questions \nconcerning \"Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances:\" \nType of \nDrug \nFirst \nUse \nMost \nRecent \nUse \nFrequency of \nUse \nDo you \nintend to \nuse in \nthe \nfuture? \nExplanation of Intent Not \nUse in the Future \nTHC \nJan. \n2015 \nJun. \n2018 \nSporadic \nusage on less \nthan a weekly \noccurrence. \nNo. \nIn order to ensure peak \nperformance in work and in \nfuture college studies, I will \nnot use this substance. \nPsilocybin \nmushrooms \nFeb. \n2015 \nFeb. \n2015 \nUsed one time.

He reiterated his intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He has \nnever had any drug treatment or counseling. (Item 5). \nApplicant smoked marijuana once every ten days after his first usage in 2014. \nFrom 2014 through 2016, he smoked it once every week. He smoked it at either his home \nor a friend\u2019s home. He purchased approximately two to three grams of marijuana at a \ntime. After his father smelled marijuana emanating from Applicant\u2019s room, he abstained \nfrom using marijuana during a five month period not specified in the record. He then \nresumed weekly usage until the week before he started his current position with a federal \ncontractor. I will consider the illegal drug use and activity not alleged in the SOR only for \nthe purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole person. (Item 5). \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. The facts alleged in the SOR \u00b6 1.a did not establish criminal activity. \nAccordingly, I must find the allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant regularly used marijuana during his four years of high school and through \nthe week before he began his current employment with a federal contractor. He misused \na prescription drug and used other illegal drugs on occasion during high school. He \nillegally purchased the marijuana and other drugs that he used. He attributed his drug use \nto experimentation and peer pressure, and professed a sincere intent never to use illegal \ndrugs again. However, he has not established a sufficient pattern of abstinence in light of \nthe recency and circumstances of his use. Moreover, I am unable to conclude that his \nmarijuana use is unlikely to recur, particularly given that he did not provide a signed \nstatement of intent. I have doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe record did not establish the criminal conduct alleged under Guideline J. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, and I have \nconsidered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns raised by his \npurchase and use of marijuana. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn March 20, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons \nwhy DoD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 4, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on August 28, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in the \nFORM. He timely supplemented the record with written explanations of his debts and \nprior Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but attached no documented submissions addressing his \ndebts and progress in resolving them. Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submission was admitted \nwithout objection as Item 9. The case was assigned to me on November 22, 2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated eight delinquent debts \nexceeding $48,000 and (b) petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2010 and was \ndischarged of debts exceeding $57,284 in October 2010. Allegedly, his listed delinquent \nstudent loan and consumer debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) of September 22, 2016 by omitting his delinquent debts \nand petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. Allegedly, these omissions covered material \nfacts. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations with \nexplanations, denying only the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.h. He claimed he could \nnot identify three of the listed debts in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d-1.e), and would work \ntowards paying off the debts he admitted. (Item 1) \nAddressing the falsification allegations covered by Guideline E, Applicant admitted \nhis omissions with explanations. He claimed he did not know his listed delinquent debts \nwere over 120 days delinquent. And, he claimed he did not believe his listing of his July \n2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was required, since it had been over six years since \nhe filed his petition and \u201chad finalized.\u201d (Item 1) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year old AF security officer for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance.

His listed debts in the SOR are comprised of the following: SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a (a consumer debt for $456); 1.b (a consumer debt for $158); 1.c (a student loan \ndebt for $10,064); 1.d (a student loan debt for $637 on a $12,841 balance); 1.e (a student \nloan debt of $382 on a $7,820 balance; 1.f (a consumer debt for $28,015); 1.g (a \nconsumer debt for $4,620); and 1.h (a consumer debt for $4,601). (Items 5-8) Three of \nthese debts (SOR debts 1.f-1.h) are covered by garnishment orders that have not been \ncompleted. \nTo date, these debts continue to appear on Applicant\u2019s credit reports as unpaid \nand unresolved. (Items 6-8) Applicant acknowledged these unpaid debts in his answers \nto interrogatories propounded to him in 2019. (Item 4) In a personal financial statement \nsubmitted in January 2019, he listed monthly net income of $5,491, monthly expenses of \n$2,556, and monthly debt payments of $385. (Item 4) He listed a monthly remainder \ndeficit of $6. (Item 4) \nIn August 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator of the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). In this personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant \nacknowledged four of the listed delinquent debts and pledged to sit down with his wife \nwho pays the bills and develop payment plans for the debts he can identify as his debts. \n(Item 3) \nAdditionally, Applicant accumulated delinquent debts prior to July 2010 totaling \nmore than $57,284 that he successfully discharged in bankruptcy in October 2010 in \nconnection with a petition he filed in July 2010. (Items 6-9) None of the listed SOR debts \nscheduled in his bankruptcy petition were discharged by his bankruptcy petition and \ncontinue to be debts that are unresolved and still outstanding. \nApplicant attributed his debt delinquencies to budgeting problems he encountered \nfollowing his separation and divorce from his second wife in 2007. (Item 9) He claims that \ntwo of the listed debts cover the same private school account and represent duplicates. \n(Item 9) His credit reports list two separate student loan identification numbers and \ndifferent dates of origination for the two student loan debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.-1-d. \nApplicant\u2019s disputed student loan debts cannot be reconciled as duplicates without more \nevidence from Applicant. (Items 6-8) Applicant did not provide any evidence of current \nbudgeting and counseling. Nor did he provide any evidence of concrete payment plans to \naddress his unresolved debts. \nE-QIP omissions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAsked to complete and e-QIP in September 2016, Applicant omitted all of his \ndelinquent accounts when responding to questions about his finances in Section 26 of \nhis e-QIP. (Item 2) Additionally, he omitted his filing of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in \nJul2010(discharge in October 2010). (Item 2) He attributed his delinquent debt omissions \nto his mistaken understanding that the listed debts were over 120 days delinquent. (Item \n1) \nApplicant attributed his Chapter 7 bankruptcy omission to his claimed belief in \n2016 that because his bankruptcy petition was filed and finalized over six years ago it \ndid not need to be listed on his 2016 e-QIP. (Item 1) Applicant\u2019s explanations for his e-\nQIP omissions are not sufficiently developed to credit him with mistaken understandings \nof what was required to be listed in e-QIP. Candor lapses are inferred with regards to \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions. \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the \ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into \naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, \nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether \nor not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not \nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines \nis to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \n     The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s \nlife to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is an \nacceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \n\n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n                                                           \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nFinancial Considerations\n   The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\n   Personal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes.  . . . AG \u00b6 15. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. Factual \ninferences cannot be drawn that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances \nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis \nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s omissions of his listed \ndelinquent debts and chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the e-QIP he completed in \nSeptember 2016. \nFinancial concerns \n      Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d See Directive 5220.6 at \nE3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted \ndebts is fully documented and creates some judgment issues. See ISCR Case 03-\n01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \n   Financial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing failures \nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n\n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile it has been many years since Applicant completed his divorce from his \nsecond wife in 2007and his ensuing bankruptcy discharge in 2010, some credit for \nextenuating circumstances associated with adjustments he needed to make with \nmanaging his finances is warranted. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problemwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances. Because Applicant has not shown any concerted efforts to pay or \notherwise resolve his listed delinquent accounts with the resources available to him \nsince his emergence from his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010, the second prong of MC \n20(d), \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is not available to him. \nWithout more demonstrated progress in addressing his listed SOR debts, none of \nthe other mitigating conditions potentially available to Applicant under Guideline F apply \nto Applicant\u2019s situation. In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed \nthe importance of a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of debt reduction \nthrough the voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely \nresolution of delinquent debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, he has failed to document any progress in addressing the \ndelinquent debts he has accumulated since emerging from his Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarge in October 2010. Despite promises made to the OPM investigator in 2018 that \nhe would check with his wife and explore payment plans with the creditors holding valid \ndebts, he has produced no proofs of making any concerted efforts to explore payment \nplans \nBased on a thorough consideration of all of the evidence presented, Applicant failed \nto mitigate security concerns associated with his accumulated debts that remain \nunresolved and outstanding. Before he can be credited with progress in stabilizing his \nfinances, he must be able to show more substantive progress in paying off or otherwise \nresolving his debts. \nPersonal conduct concerns\n    Potentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability  requirement \nfor holding a security clearance are the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s inferred \ndeliberate and knowing omissions of his delinquent debts and Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition, all incurred within the previous seven years preceding his completion of his e-\nQIP in September 2016. So much trust is imposed on those cleared to see classified and \nsensitive information that accommodations for breaches are necessarily calibrated \nnarrowly. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 506, 511 n.6 (1980). Material breaches \nof an applicant\u2019s disclosure responsibilities in a security clearance application are, in \nturn, incompatible with the high trust principles affirmed in Snepp. \nApplicant\u2019s omitted information covered important background information and, as \nsuch was material to any assessment of Applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a security \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \nclearance. His omissions invite application of one of the disqualifying conditions (DCs) of \nthe personal conduct guideline: DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \nApplicant did not acknowledge his delinquent debts and Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition and discharge until he was confronted with the information. His disclosures that \nwere made only after being confronted with the information do not meet the prompt, \ngood faith requirements of MC \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts,\u201d of Guideline E. \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. While promising the OPM \ninvestigator who interviewed him in 2018 that he would look into debts identified in his \ncredit reports as seriously delinquent, he failed to follow up with inquiries with his listed \ncreditors and take remedial steps to address his debts. And, when asked to disclose his \ndelinquent debts and Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, he failed to do so until confronted \ntwo years later in an OPM interview. \nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s lack of progress in addressing his listed delinquent \ndebts listed in the SOR and his ensuing omissions of his delinquent debts in his \ncompleted e-QIP, mitigation credit is not supported by the evidence presented. \nConclusions are warranted that Applicant\u2019s finances are insufficiently stabilized at this \ntime to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. Neither \nhis accumulated delinquent debts and Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition nor e-QIP \nomissions are mitigated. Eligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and \ncircumstances of this case is inconsistent with the national interest. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):   AGAINST APPLICANT\n         Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h                                    Against Applicant \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                AGAINST APPLICANT\n         Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:                                   Against Applicant \n                                                             Conclusion \nIn light of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the national \n\n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                       \n                                                       \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n08/19/2019 \n \nDecision \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 1, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 9, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on June 19, \n2019. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 4. Applicant submitted a five-page document \nmarked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections to any documents, and AE \nA and Items 1 through 4 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 7, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2007. She married in 2014 and has no children. She has worked for a federal \ncontractor since 2004. She was granted a secret clearance in 2013, and access to special \nprograms from January 2016 to March 2016. \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in September 2013. In it she \nreported that in the past seven years she had not used any illegal drugs or controlled \nsubstances. (Item 2) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated:  \n \nMy personal conduct with being dishonest and falsifying information on my \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) back in \n2013 is unacceptable. I am embarrassed of my behavior and regret \ncontinuing to misuse illegal drugs especially while holding a security \nclearance. While continuing my background investigation during my \npolygraph test, I felt a lot of guilt for falsifying information. I confessed to the \ninvestigator that I had misused illegal drugs. I knew that my dishonesty \nwould likely affect my clearance investigation, but I felt relieved the truth \nwas out. I truly regret my attempts to conceal my past conduct as I noted \nabove I am very embarrassed and ashamed. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in a September 2017 SCA that she used marijuana from \napproximately 1993 to March 2016. She smoked it; ate it in brownies; and inhaled it as \nsecond hand smoke when her husband was using it. She estimated from 1993 to 1997 \nshe used it once biweekly; from 1998 to 2001, she used it about three times a week; from \n2002 to 2005, she did not use marijuana; from 2006 to 2013, she did not use it more than \nthree times a week; and from 2013 to 2016, she used it not more than twice a week or \nsometimes not at all. She did not use illegal drugs from 2002 to 2005, because she was \napplying for jobs, like the one she currently has, with a defense contractor. \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant also disclosed that from 1999 to 2013 with varying frequency, she used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms. She used Ecstasy, from July 2001 to February 2016, with \nvarying frequency.  \n \n \nIn her 2017 SCA, SOR answer, and response to the FORM, Applicant stated she \ndoes not intend to use drugs in the future because they are illegal, and they could impact \nher career and security clearance. (Items 1, 3, 4; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2018. She \ntold the investigator that she used marijuana by herself, with her husband in their home, \nand occasionally with friends. The second hand marijuana smoke she inhaled was from \nher husband smoking marijuana in her presence in their home. Her husband also \nprovided her drugs. She did not purchase illegal drugs. She told the investigator that she \ndid not disclose her drug use on her earlier SCA because she feared the repercussions \nfrom her usage and that it would affect her reputation negatively. During an interview prior \nto a polygraph, she said she felt guilty for providing false information and confessed to \nher past illegal drug use (Items 1, 4). \n \n \nApplicant told the government investigator that her spouse continues to use illegal \ndrugs, but has agreed to not use them in her presence or talk about illegal drugs with her. \nShe said her behavior is separate and independent of her husband\u2019s conduct. She said \nher drug use has had no negative physical effects on her and no effects on her personal \nlife or finances. It has had no negative effects on her ability to do her job or safeguard \ninformation. She only used the drugs during personal time and not on the job. (Item 3) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s FORM response, she stated:  \n \n[M]any of the individuals that were around during the drug use, I no longer \nassociate with as there was a realization that these contacts were not going \nto help improve my life or support my personal growth. It was better to avoid \nthem and focus on more important things in my life such as family and true \nclose friends. I fully understand that illegal drug use has only hindered me \nand has affected my professional career by causing me to lose my security \nclearance. The stress of this adjudication process has made me regret my \npast actions, and I intend to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. (AE A) \n \n \nApplicant provided her performance ratings from 2008 to 2018. They are: meets \nrequirements; exceeds requirements; highly effective contribution; and exceptional \ncontribution. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant illegally possessed and used marijuana with varying frequency from \n1993 to 2016. She illegally possessed and used Ecstasy with varying frequency from July \n2001 to approximately February 2016. She illegally possessed and used hallucinogenic \nmushrooms from April 1999 to approximately January 2013. She held a security \nclearance from November 2013 to March 2016. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \n \nApplicant was a frequent drug abuser from 1993 to 2016. She stopped using illegal \ndrugs for a period when she was applying for a job, which indicates she was aware of the \nprohibition. She acknowledged her drug use, and disclosed it to the investigator prior to \na polygraph. She said she does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. She was put \non notice when she completed her 2013 SCA that illegal drugs were a security concern, \nbut continued to use them. She had an opportunity at that time to stop using illegal drugs, \nespecially after being granted a security clearance, but failed to do so. She used the drugs \nwith her husband, whom she said supplied them to her. They used them in their house. \nHe continues to use illegal drugs. She continues to live with her husband whom she says \nwill not use illegal drugs in front of her. I do not find that statement convincing. Applicant \nhas been hiding her drug use for many years. I find it may recur and her conduct casts \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There is no evidence \nshe has had a drug evaluation or has participated in drug treatment. None of the above \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant used using illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. She \ndeliberately failed to disclose her extensive illegal drug abuse on her September 2013 \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSCA. Her drug use was cross-alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nThe evidence does not support the application of any of the mitigating conditions. \nThe same analysis under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, applies \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct. As Applicant stated in her answer to the SOR, she \ndisclosed her past drug abuse during an interview by a government investigator prior to \na polygraph. She had been using illegal drugs for years. She did not promptly correct her \nconcealment and falsification, but rather based on it, she was granted a security \nclearance and then continued to use drugs. She continues to live with her husband, a \nknown drug abuser, who supplied her with the illegal drugs. Her pattern of misconduct is \nnot insignificant and casts serious doubts on her reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. She has an extensive history of using illegal drugs from \n1993 to 2016. She used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, which was \ngranted in 2013 and based on a falsification in her SCA that she had not used drugs in \nthe past seven years. This information was concealed until she was being interviewed as \npart of a polygraph. Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for \na security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, \nand Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to renew Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.            \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 3, 2015, Applicant signed a security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On March 14, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a SOR to Applicant under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February \n20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive), January 2, 1992, Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017.  \nOn April 16, 2019, Applicant provided a response to the SOR and requested a \nhearing.

Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.   \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. I held the record open for 30 days in the event either party wanted to submit \nadditional documentation. On July 8, 2019, DOHA received the hearing transcript. \nApplicant timely provided two exhibits, which were admitted without objections.

(Tr.10-13) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted he incurred the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i, \n1.k-1.m, and 1.o. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  He did not provide any \nmitigating documentation relevant to any debts \n \nApplicant is 30 years old, and he has been employed as a customer service \nrepresentative for a government contractor since September 2016. In 2007, he enlisted \nin the U.S. Navy and remained on active duty until June 2013, when he received an \nhonorable discharge. In 2014, Applicant received a welding certification. Between 2011 \nand 2016, he was married and divorced twice with the same woman. He has two minor \nchildren. (Tr. 14-17, 22-23; GE 1)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s income dropped after he left the U.S. Navy in June 2013. During his \nenlistment, he suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). He was an E-4 at the time of his \ndischarge, and was permanently decertified for duty due to poor attitude, lack of \nmotivation and loss of confidence. He currently suffers memory issues from this injury. \nApplicant was going through a divorce, working part-time for about a year, and was \nunemployed for about a year while he attended school. He was overwhelmed and \nstressed, and eventually voluntarily admitted himself into a hospital. During this time \nperiod, Applicant acknowledged that he overlooked his financial obligations. (Tr. 12, 18-\n20, 38-44, 47-50; AE A) \n \nApplicant has worked for his employer for about three years, and his monthly net \nincome is approximately $2,000. He also receives $800 monthly from the Veterans \nAdministration for his service disability. His live-in girlfriend baby-sits and receives about \n$100 a week. Applicant provided a budget after the hearing that did not include his \ngirlfriend\u2019s income. His monthly net income of $2,800 pays all of their monthly expenses, \nto include a $250 monthly payment for medical bills, with a zero remainder. (Tr. 12, 18-\n20, 38-44, 47-50; AE A) \n \nThe SOR alleges fifteen delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,000.The \nrecord establishes the status of Applicant\u2019s accounts as follows: \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a repossessed car account with a deficit balance of $5,973. \nAfter Applicant got out of the military, he soon realized that he could no longer afford his \nmonthly car payments. In late 2013, he called the creditor and asked that they pick up the \ncar. He called the creditor in 2016 about the debt, but since that time, he has not made \nany attempt to pay or resolve this outstanding account. The January 2019 credit report \nshowed the account as delinquent. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 24-27; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f allege three defaulted student loans with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education in the total amount of $8,947. Applicant borrowed these funds \nfor his education in 2013. Applicant stated that after he left school, he was obligated to \nmake payments on his student loans. He claimed to have made some payments, but his \n2018 income tax refund of about $3,000 was involuntarily intercepted to pay toward his \ndelinquent child support and unpaid student loans. Since then, Applicant has not made \nany effort to contact the creditor or establish a payment plan for his delinquent student \nloans. The January 2019 credit report showed the account as delinquent. These debts \nare not resolved. (Tr. 27-29, 47, 51-52; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.e allege two delinquent accounts with a credit union that were \nreferred for collection in the amount of $5,775. He had opened these accounts as a co-\nsigner for his girlfriend in 2016 or 2017. One account was for a vehicle loan, and the other \naccount was for a credit card. His girlfriend recently quit her job to start another business \nventure that did not succeed. She currently baby-sits to make money, but the income is \ninsufficient to make payments on these delinquent accounts. Applicant has limited funds \nand cannot make payments. The January 2019 credit report showed the account as \ndelinquent. These accounts are unresolved. (Tr. 29-32; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.i, 1.k-1.m, and 1.o allege medical accounts placed for collection in \nthe amount of $3,151. Applicant admitted these debts were for medical services provided \nto him from a hospital covering different time periods. He is paying the collection agency \n$200 a month over a 12-month period to resolve these accounts. At the time of the \nhearing, he had made two $200 payments. He claimed he paid the hospital about $50 \neach month for his medical services. He was not sure of the remaining balance owed for \nthe outstanding medical bills. He stated that he would provide documentation during the \n30-day period the record was held open. Applicant failed to provide this documentation, \nand these debts are unresolved. (Tr. 32-35, 49; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a delinquent account with a jeweler that was referred for \ncollection in the amount of $287. Applicant denied this debt in his SOR response. He \nstated that this account stemmed from an engagement ring purchased for his ex-wife. He \ndisputed the account with the creditor because he believed he paid this account in full. \nThe January 2019 credit report showed the account as delinquent. He stated that he \nwould provide documentation during the 30-day period the record was held open. \nApplicant failed to provide this documentation, and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 35-36; GE \n2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a delinquent account with a cellular company referred for \ncollection in the amount of $150. Applicant denied this debt in his SOR response because \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nhe said he paid it and disputed this debt with the creditor. The January 2019 credit report \nshowed the account as delinquent. Applicant failed to provide supporting documentation, \nand this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 36-38; GE 2) \n \nApplicant has not sought the assistance of a financial counseling program to \nresolve his indebtedness. His intention is to pay off his outstanding medical debts first, \nand then start paying the delinquent credit union accounts. He provided a letter of \nrecommendation from his manager stating that Applicant is an exceptional employee, \nwho gives maximum effort to support his customers. (Tr. 45; AE B) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n  \nApplicant admitted owing debts and the 2019 Credit report documents his \nresponsibility for the debts he denied. The record establishes the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant presented some mitigating evidence. He was underemployed or \nunemployed for a two-year period after his 2013 discharge from the military while \nattending school. His medical expenses related to his TBI and mental health issues \ncontributed to his financial problems. He cosigned a credit card account and a car loan \nwith his girlfriend, and she failed to comply with the terms of the contract. These are \ncircumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. However, to \nreceive full credit for this mitigating condition, Applicant must show that he acted \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant failed to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly since he did not take any responsible action to resolve his delinquent debts \nuntil two months before his security clearance hearing. He has only made two payments \nfor his outstanding medical accounts on a one-year repayment plan, despite being fully \nemployed for three years.  \n \nApplicant failed to provide documentation that he has a legitimate basis to dispute \nany of his outstanding accounts, and he failed to provide copies of cancelled checks, or \na current statement, to show that he is paying his medical debt as claimed. He did not \nparticipate in financial counseling and there is no evidence that he is making good-faith \nefforts to resolve his delinquent debts. There is insufficient assurance that his debts are \nunder control. The only payment Applicant has made toward his delinquent student loans \nwas an involuntary interception of his income tax refund that was applied to this debt. \nUnder all of these circumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 30 years old, and has been employed as a customer service \nrepresentative since September 2016 for a government contractor. He currently lives with \nhis girlfriend, and he provides the majority of financial support for their living \narrangements. His manager finds Applicant to be an exceptional employee providing \noutstanding customer service.  \n \nApplicant did not provide any evidence of payments, payment plans, copies of \ndispute correspondence with creditors, or other actions to resolve the debts in the SOR. \nHe did not start taking responsible action to address his financial obligations until two \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nmonths before his hearing. There is no track record of steady, systematic payments over \nan extended period of time. His actions demonstrate a lack of financial responsibility and \ngood judgment, and raise unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of his past-due debt, and a track record \nof behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of his security clearance worthiness.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude \nthat financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

He mitigated the criminal conduct and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.\nStatement of the Case \nOn January 31, 2018, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On March 18, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. He admitted all of the SOR allegations and provided explanations \n\n \n2 \n \nwhy he believed his misconduct should be mitigated. On August 8, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me. On August 30, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for September 18, 2019. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3; Applicant testified and offered nine documents, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough I into evidence. I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2019, and the record \nclosed.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018, and in 2019, he \nenrolled into a graduate program for a masters of business administration (MBA) degree. \nHe expects to graduate with his MBA in 2021. He married in 2011. He has two daughters, \nages seven and fifteen. He also has three stepchildren, ages ten, twelve, and fourteen. \nHe has been employed by a DOD contractor since January 2018 as a quality engineer. \nIn 2018, Applicant was issued an interim DOD security clearance, however, that security \nclearance was removed in approximately September 2019. (Tr. 16, 20-22; GE 1, AE A) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with criminal \ndamage, theft, and tapering with coin machines. He admitted this arrest and stated that \nhe was 18 years old. He had a young daughter at the time and needed to provide \nadditional financial support. He cut the locks off of vending machines and took the money. \nThe vending machines were located at his place of employment, a grocery store, and he \nwas observed on a video camera stealing the money. Applicant was terminated by his \nemployer. The court sentenced him to 180 days in jail, with all but three days suspended, \nand he was ordered to pay full restitution to his former employer. (Tr. 23-25; GE 1) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was charged in May 2015 with Theft. He was at \na national discount department store and stole several items, to include a Fitbit tracker \nand a box of cards. He was 29 years old and married at the time. He stated that the theft \nof the items was an unplanned impulse while he was shopping, and the Fitbit was going \nto be a gift for his wife. Applicant was caught on video surveillance stealing the items. He \npleaded guilty, the court and ordered him to pay restitution, and he was sentenced to \nserve time in the county jail, with all jail time suspended. (Tr. 25-28; GE 1) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross referenced the allegations set forth under paragraph 1.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant resigned his employment by mutual agreement \nin June 2015 with a restaurant chain after his involvement of theft. As a manager of the \nrestaurant, he had the ability to void sales and pocket the money. The stolen money \ntotaled nearly $2,000, and was taken over an 18-month period between 2014 and 2015. \nApplicant stated the money was used to buy the restaurant work crew drinks at another \nbar after they closed the restaurant. (Tr. 28-30) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant stated that since June 2015, he has never had the impulse to steal again. \nHe has taken steps to better himself, such as obtaining his bachelor\u2019s degree in May \n2018, and eliminating people in his life that are not a good influence. His job and family \nare very important to him. He started his graduate program in September 2019, with a \nfocus on executive management, and his employer is providing some assistance with his \ntuition expense. His wife earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology, and he has been \nusing her as a source to set goals in his life. Applicant had an undesirable upbringing, \nand his wife has helped him deal with issues stemming from his childhood. Applicant \nadmitted he has made mistakes in the past for which he is embarrassed and remorseful. \nHe is continuously working to rectify those mistakes and to ensure they will never be \nrepeated. (Tr. 31-36, 38) \n \n \nApplicant provided two character reference letters and two of his most recent \nemployee performance appraisals at the hearing. Applicant\u2019s current manager reported \nthat Applicant was initially hired for an internship, and after observing his dedication and \nexceptional business knowledge on the job, Applicant was offered permanent \nemployment. For over a year under his supervision, Applicant consistently demonstrated \nexcellent engineering and leadership skills, and is considered an asset by the DOD \ncontractor. Applicant\u2019s two employee appraisals also support the highlighted qualities \nenumerated by his manger. (AE B, AE C, AE G, AE H) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n4 \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J; Criminal Conduct \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:   \n  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted. \n \n  \nApplicant was charged with criminal offenses in 2004 and in 2015. Applicant also \nstole approximately $2,000 from his employer between 2014 and 2015, for which he was \nnot criminally charged, but Applicant admits his conduct was criminal. AG\u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and \n31(b) are established.   \n \n  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and the following \nconditions are relevant:   \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and   \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s thefts establish a pattern of criminal conduct, and despite suffering \nlegal consequences, the pattern shows that he had a difficult time controlling his impulse \nto steal. In June 2015, Applicant decided he needed to make positive changes in his life. \nHe removed himself from people who have a negative impact on his behavior. He is \nsupported by his wife, who has a bachelor\u2019s in psychology, to work on his impulsive \nbehavior and prevent future criminal conduct. Applicant has set goals in his life, and in \n2018, he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business. This year he enrolled into a \ngraduate program with the full support of his employer. There has been no criminal \nconduct for over four years, which shows his criminal behavior in unlikely to recur. His \ncontinued success at his place of employment and the high regard his employer has for \nApplicant also shows he is reliable, trustworthy, and uses good judgment. Criminal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . \n \n  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n  \nGuideline J allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are cross-alleged under Guideline E \u00b6 2.a. \nEach of them is established by the record evidence. Since I held that Guideline J security \nconcerns were mitigated, there is no need to further discuss the criminal conduct security \nconcerns that were also cross-alleged here. Guideline E \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant\u2019s theft \nfrom his employer totaling nearly $2,000 over an 18-month period. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d)(3) apply. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n  \nApplicant has not been involved in any thefts since 2015. He has made positive \nlifestyle changes, and obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. He acknowledged the \nbehavior and is remorseful for his misconduct. As to SOR \u00b6 2.b, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) \napply for the same reasons as set forth in the analysis of the mitigating conditions under \nGuideline J, above. Personal Conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline J and Guideline E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) was addressed under that guideline, but some \nwarrant additional comment.     \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant has made positive changes in his life, and he continues to receive \nsupport from his spouse to stay focused on his future goals. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2018, and he has a successful career with his employer. He has not engaged \nin criminal conduct for the past four years, and is committed to graduating with an MBA \nby 2021. I find future criminal behavior is unlikely to recur. After evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct \nand personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant denied all the allegations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at his present job in May 2016. He is a senior information systems (IT) storage consultant. He experienced unemployment from March 2016 until May 2016. He worked for various private sector employers from July 2010 to March 2016 providing IT services. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is single, never married and has a four-year- old child, for whom he pays child support. (Tr. 8-9, 21-22; GE 1) The SOR alleged three delinquent debts (a consumer debt, child support arreage, and a lodging debt) totaling approximately $57,204. The debts were listed in credit reports from August 2016, August 2017, February 2019, and May 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c). (AE 4-6) Applicant pointed out that he is a good citizen who pays his taxes and has no criminal history. He also has family members who served in the military. Applicant\u2019s child support debt arose because he disputed that the state child support enforcement division could require him to pay child support without a judge\u2019s order. He does not dispute that the child is his.

The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 24, 2019, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on May 29, 2019, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on June 3, 2019. Applicant voluntarily consented to proceed with his hearing \nwithout the 15 days\u2019 notice described in the Directive. The Government offered exhibits \n\n \n2 \n \n(GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list and discovery letter were identified as hearing exhibits (HE) I \nand II. Applicant testified but did not offer any exhibits. Attachments to Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer were considered. The record remained open until June 14, 2019, to allow \nApplicant to submit documentary evidence. He submitted AE A through C, which were \nadmitted without objection. Email correspondence with Applicant concerning his post-\nhearing submission is reflected by HE III. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 13, 2019. (Tr. 6-8) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied all the allegations. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in May 2016. He is a senior information systems (IT) storage \nconsultant. He experienced unemployment from March 2016 until May 2016. He worked \nfor various private sector employers from July 2010 to March 2016 providing IT \nservices. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is single, never married and has a four-year-\nold child, for whom he pays child support. (Tr. 8-9, 21-22; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent debts (a consumer debt, child support \narreage, and a lodging debt) totaling approximately $57,204. The debts were listed in \ncredit reports from August 2016, August 2017, February 2019, and May 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.c). (AE 4-6) \n \n \nApplicant pointed out that he is a good citizen who pays his taxes and has no \ncriminal history. He also has family members who served in the military. Applicant\u2019s \nchild support debt arose because he disputed that the state child support enforcement \ndivision could require him to pay child support without a judge\u2019s order. He does not \ndispute that the child is his. The consumer debt of approximately $25,000 was incurred \nin 2016, when Applicant received a loan after he purchased his home in the state where \nhe was living at the time. After he lost his job he defaulted on the loan. The final debt \nwas for a contracted living arrangement that Applicant was in when he moved to a new \nstate. He moved out early because the noise was too much for him to handle and \nmanagement did not respond to his numerous complaints. The Government conceded \nthis may be a case of constructive eviction. SOR \u00b6 1(c) is resolved for Applicant. (Tr. 22-\n24, 38-40; GE 2)  \n \n \nThe status of the remaining SOR debts is as follows: \n \n \nConsumer debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a). This debt went delinquent in August 2016. \nApplicant told a defense investigator in July 2018 that he would call the creditor and \nstart making payments on the account. There is no documentary evidence to support \nthat Applicant took any action at that time. Applicant admitted this debt in his testimony. \nHe stated that he had no communication with the creditor for the past 18 months. Post-\nhearing (June 2019), Applicant documented that he contacted the collection agency \n\n \n3 \n \nservicing this debt. He was offered two payment options. He failed to produce evidence \nthat he accepted either of the proposed options. Applicant also indicated that he \nreceived proceeds of approximately $65,000 from the sale of his home in another state. \nHe used the proceeds to pay his child support arreage and buy some land in another \nstate for investment purposes. He did not apply any of the proceeds toward this debt. \nThis debt is unresolved. (Tr. 23-25, 35; GE 2, 4; AE A, C) \n \n \nChild Support (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant documented that he paid his child support \narreage in March 2019. He also documented that his ongoing support payments are \nbeing deducted from his paycheck in the amount of $678 every two weeks. The debt is \nresolved. (Tr. 26-27; Answer (attachments); AE A-B) \n \n \nApplicant did not produce a budget and there is no evidence that he sought \nfinancial counseling.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n4 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.   \n \nApplicant had three delinquent debts. One he legitimately disputed, one he paid, \nand one remains unpaid or unresolved. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and, although he resolved his child support arreage, \nhe has not resolved his consumer debt, which exceeds $20,000. He failed to produce \nevidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s short period of unemployment can be considered a circumstance \nbeyond his control. However, he did not act responsibly by failing to take any action to \nresolve the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1(a) before his hearing even though he had the \nresources to do so from the proceeds of his home sale. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not support that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis partially applicable.  \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant paid his child support arrearage and is making his required \nmonthly support payments, he did not present evidence of financial counseling. Given \nthe unpaid status of the remaining consumer debt, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nnot under control and good-faith efforts to pay or resolve the remaining debt is lacking. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant credibly disputed SOR \u00b6 1.c and AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies to that debt. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service and the circumstances \nsurrounding his indebtedness. However, I also considered that he has made insufficient \nefforts to resolve his debts. He has not established a meaningful track record of debt \nmanagement, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.)   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph:   1.a: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.b \u2013 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 1, 2018. \nOn March 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DOD as \nof June 8, 2017.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 2, 2019. She elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). On April 25, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 6. Applicant received the FORM on May 22, 2019. She was afforded 30 days \nafter receiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Applicant submitted an undated response that was received at DOHA on or \nabout May 24, 2019. It is marked as Item 7 and admitted without objection.  \nThe case was assigned to me on June 14, 2019. The SOR and the answer (Items \n1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. The Government\u2019s Items 3 through 6, provided \nwith the FORM, are admitted into evidence without objection.  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h. She provided a narrative \nexplanation in her SOR Response, and another narrative explanation in her FORM \nResponse. She provided no documents. I have incorporated her admissions and \nexplanations into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. She and her husband have been married since July \n2016. They have a two-year-old son. Applicant was married to her first husband from \nMarch 2006 to June 2015. She has three children from her first marriage, ages 15, 13, \nand 9. (Item 3, Item 7) \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2002. She became a certified medical \nassistant in 2006, and has been employed in the health care industry ever since, with \nsome breaks in employment while raising her children. She was unemployed from June \n2008 to January 2010, and also from September 2016 to April 2017. In April 2017, she \nbegan a job as a medical assistant, and submitted her SCA in January 2018. (Item 3) It \nis unclear if she remains in that position, since the SOR was sent to Applicant through a \nsubsequent employer, as reflected on her SOR receipt.  \n \nApplicant has never served in the military, but it is likely that she either is or was a \nmilitary spouse, since her SCA references living on a military base between 2007 and \n2009, and later moving due to \u201cPCS\u201d (permanent change of station). (Item 3) It is not clear \nfrom the record how her husband is employed.  \n \nThe SOR concerns eight delinquent debts, totaling about $28,589. Applicant \nadmitted all of the debts in her SOR Response. (Items 1, 2) They are also established by \ncredit reports in the record, from February 2018 and October 2018. (Items 5, 6) An April \n2019 credit report shows a single credit card account in good standing, and no delinquent \ndebts. (Item 4)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that has been charged off in the amount of $13,375. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($6,036) and 1.d ($3,504) are student loans that have been placed for \ncollection. SOR \u00b6 1.c is an account for past-due rent that has been placed for collection \nin the amount of $3,079. SOR \u00b6 1.e is a past-due medical account, placed for collection \nin the amount of $135. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($988) and 1.g ($621) are past-due accounts to phone \ncompanies. SOR \u00b6 1.h ($140) is a past-due account to a fitness club.  \n \nApplicant did not declare any delinquent debts or past-due financial accounts on \nher SCA. In her answer to the SOR, she explains that she first incurred debts during the \nbreakup of her first marriage. Other debts followed after the marriage ended and she lived \non her own. Applicant explains that she put her children\u2019s needs first, prioritizing them \nover paying her debts. She needs a well-paying job to help her begin to address her \ndebts, and notes that she has not incurred new debt. (Item 2) \n \nIn her FORM Response, Applicant explains further that she hopes to have her \ndebts paid off in five years. She notes that she has not provided proof that she has \narranged payment plans with her creditors because she does not want to enter into a \npayment plan that she cannot afford. She is considering debt-management counseling. \nShe gets advice from her husband on how to manage her finances better. (Item 7) \n \nApplicant explains that her plan is to make a list of all of her debts, and then pay \nthem off, one by one, paying the smallest debt first, working her way to the larger debts. \nShe wants to continue her medical education in the future and thereby earn more income. \nHer youngest son is in daycare, costing $210 a week. Once her son is in elementary \nschool, her finances will improve. (Item 7) \n \nApplicant provided no information about any steps she has taken to attempt to \nsettle, pay, or otherwise resolve, any of the debts in the SOR. She provided no \ndocumentation of the current status of any debt alleged. She also provided no details or \ndocuments about her current financial situation, such as her household\u2019s assets, monthly \nincome, or expenses.  \nPolicies \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns:  \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d and (c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d are applicable, \ngiven the record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to fully apply any of these mitigating \nconditions. She explained that her SOR debts were incurred either as her first marriage \nwas ending, or in the period after that. She has found it difficult to make ends meet, and \nhas prioritized her children\u2019s needs over repaying her creditors.  \n \nWhile this is understandable, this alone is not enough to conclude that her debts \noccurred due to circumstances beyond her control. Moreover, even if so, Applicant did \nnot establish that she undertook reasonable efforts under the circumstances to resolve \nher debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore does not fully apply. Similarly, she did not establish \nsufficient good-faith efforts to pay or otherwise resolve her debts, as required under AG \n\u00b6 20(d).  \n \nApplicant has yet to set out a reasonable plan for repaying her debts. She has not \nmade any concrete steps towards implementing a repayment plan, such as by \nestablishing a track record of steady payments towards her debts as best she can. She \nprovided no documents about the current status of her debts, all of which are ongoing \nand unresolved.  \n \nIt is true that a recent credit report shows no delinquent debt. However, the fact \nthat a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, \nindependent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). Applicant also acknowledged responsibility for all of the debts \nin the SOR, and did not establish that any of them have been resolved. Applicant provided \ninsufficient evidence to apply any of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n\n \n6 \n \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant did not provide any documented \ninformation that she is resolving her debts in a good-faith, responsible manner. She did \nnot establish that her debts are being resolved or are under control, and did not establish \nthat her debts are unlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on her current judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n_____________________________\nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 19, 2018. On \nMarch 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 14, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On August 6, 2019, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 3. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on August 28, 2019, \nand did not respond. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Item 3 is admitted \n\n \n2 \n \ninto evidence. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included documents that I marked and admitted \ninto evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 5, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 52, is married without children. He earned his high school diploma \nin 1985. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an aircraft mechanic since \n2007. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant failed to timely file, as required, his federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 through 2017. He did not timely file them because he did not believe \nhe had any obligation to do so if he was owed refunds, which he expected from the IRS \nand the state for each of those years. In his SOR answer, he acknowledged that his \nbelief was \u201cerroneous.\u201d (Item 2) \n \nApplicant reported the derogatory information about his tax return filings on his \nJuly 2018 SCA and promised to file all of his delinquent returns by the end of August \n2018. He filed all three federal returns by certified mail on February 19, 2019. He filed \nhis state returns electronically, on February 12, 2019, for tax years 2015 and 2016, and \non February 13, 2019, for tax years 2017 and 2018. The status of his 2018 federal \nreturn was not addressed in the record. The expected refunds for tax years 2015 \nthrough 2017 totaled $20,918 from the IRS, and $2,906 from the state. (Item 3 at 31-32; \nAE A, B) \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n3 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at \n3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file, as required, his federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2015 through 2017 establishes the following disqualifying \ncondition: AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired). \n \n \nThe following are the potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns over a three- \nyear period. It is well-established law that individuals who are required to file income tax \nreturns shall do so in a timely manner regardless of whether a refund is owed. However, \nApplicant believed, at the time, that he was not required to file a tax return if he was \nowed a refund, which he expected in each of those tax years. He eventually realized \nthat his belief was wrong. He filed all the delinquent federal and state income tax returns \nwithin a reasonable time period of the date he initially promised, considering the number \nof returns to be filed, and, most importantly, before the SOR was issued.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s late tax return filings were not willful violations of his legal duties, but \nrather the result of a mistaken belief that was justifiable given his background and \nexperience. The fact that he not only resolved the concerns prior to issuance of the \nSOR, but also filed his 2018 state return early, demonstrates that he will comply with his \ntax filing obligations going forward. In light of the responsible manner in which Applicant \nhandled the concerns raised in the SOR, I conclude that his late filings are not likely to \nrecur and no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (g) are established.  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his failure to timely file federal and state tax income tax returns. \nAccordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 19, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline H, drug involvement \nand substance misuse. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 27, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on May 31, \n2019. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 4. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. The evidence is \nadmitted into the record. The case was assigned to me on July 29, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nIn its FORM, the Government withdrew the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k. She \ndenied the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.i. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. She is not married and has no children. She attended \ncollege for a period, but did not earn a degree. She has been employed by a federal \ncontractor since August 2017. (Item 2) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in September 2017. In \nit she disclosed her delinquent debts. She indicated that she had been in contact with her \ncreditors regarding payment options and intended to make the debts current as soon as \npossible, which would occur when she received her paycheck. (Item 2) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, she also disclosed that her financial problems were attributed \nto unemployment and underemployment. She also indicated that some of the debts were \nincurred with her ex-boyfriend and he has not contributed to paying them. She stated that \nher student loans were not due for payment because they were under a grace period, \nand she was confident that she would be able to make the payments when due. She \nstated:  \n \nI intend to put more than half of my paychecks (more if I can afford it) \ntowards paying these debts to make them current as soon as possible. I \nalso intend to begin paying my student loans as soon as I receive a request \nto do so. \n \n* * * \n \nI have not been able to make any regular payments. I am now employed in \nan office environment with stable income, and will fill my obligation of paying \nfrom my first check and every check until it is cleared. (Item 2) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated that she believed that the student \nloans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.g were the same debt. She also believed that the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e and 1.h were also the same debt. Credit reports from February \n2019 and May 2018 reflect the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. They also reflect that \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe accounts Applicant said were duplicates, have different account numbers. She did not \nprovide evidence to confirm that any of the debts alleged are duplicates. (Items 1, 3, 4) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated that when her student loan payment \nbecame due she was unable to pay the amount and was denied a lower payment option \nfrom the creditor. She said she was able to obtain a deferment, and her father, a cosigner \nof the loans, agreed to pay the loans on her behalf. She did not hear from the creditor \nand assumed her father was making the payments. She later learned he was not making \nthe payments. She contacted the creditor in April 2019 and requested it provide her \ndocumentation on the student loans. She was waiting for the documents when she \ncompleted her SOR answer. She has not made any payments, but is pursuing payment \noptions. She indicated her future intention is to pay her student loans, but is unable at this \ntime because she can only afford to pay her living necessities. She is confident that by \nworking hard and receiving a promotion in the future she will be able to pay her student \nloans. The debts are unresolved. (Item 1).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f and 1.h are credit \ncard debts. She stated in her SOR answer that in the past these credit cards were in good \nstanding, until she became temporarily unemployed due to immediate family issues. As \nher income allows, she intends to pay all of her debts. These debts are unresolved. (Item \n1) \n \n \nApplicant denied the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. This debt appears on both \ncredit reports. She did not provide evidence that she has disputed the debt. The debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is for a gym membership that had an automatic payment plan. She \nacknowledged she had a membership with the club, but was unaware of the debt and \nstated she was never notified it was delinquent. She stated she has asked the creditor for \ndocuments to confirm the debt. The debts are unresolved. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in her SCA that she had filed for an extension regarding her \n2016 federal income tax returns. In her SOR answer, Applicant stated she was unaware \nher federal tax returns were not file for tax year 2016. This contradicts her disclosure in \nher SCA. She stated she was unemployed in 2016, dealing with family issues, and she \nmust have forgotten to file them. She stated she was researching ways to obtain copies \nof her 2016 W-2 tax forms and believes she may be entitled to a refund, which she would \napply toward her delinquent debts. Applicant did not provide proof that she has filed her \n2016 federal or state income tax returns. (Items 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant indicated in her SOR answer that she had family issues that related to \nan ongoing alcohol-related issue with her parents, which had a profound effect on her as \nan only child. She did not elaborate. She takes pride in past, present, and future that has \nbeen sensible and upstanding. She said she intends to take all necessary steps to resolve \nthe alleged delinquent debts as soon as possible and in a responsible manner. (Item 1) \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to file her 2016 federal and state income tax returns. She has \ndelinquent student loans, credit cards, and other debts that she is unable to pay. There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n6 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed or is in compliance with those arrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provided evidence that she has paid or made payment \narrangements for any of her delinquent student loans or other delinquent debts. She did \nnot provide proof that she has filed her 2016 federal and state income tax returns. The \nfinancial problems and debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to unemployment, underemployment \nand family issues. She did not elaborate on how her family issues impacted her finances \nor ability to file taxes. Her employment problems were beyond her control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She failed to provide evidence that she has taken any action on her \ndelinquent debts since her employment began in August 2017, despite her promises that \nshe would begin to do so once she received a paycheck. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling and there are not \nclear indications that the problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does \nnot apply. Applicant did not provide evidence that she has made a good-faith effort to pay \nher delinquent student loans or creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Applicant disputed \na medical debt, but did not provide documentary evidence of her efforts to dispute the \ndebt or resolve it. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Evidence was not provided to show \nApplicant has an arrangement to file her 2016 federal and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(g) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. She was unable to pay her debts and student loans due \nto unemployment and underemployment. She has been employed for two years, but did \nnot provide evidence of any action she has taken to pay her delinquent accounts, despite \npromises to do so. She failed to provide evidence that she filed her 2016 federal or state \nincome tax returns. Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 60-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance, although he has held a clearance in the past. He is employed as a contracts manager for a large company in the defense industry. His annual salary is about $140,000, the highest it\u2019s been for some time. He has been so employed since February 2019. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. He has been married since 1984. His employment history includes: (1) full-time subcontracts specialist for a defense contractor from November 2017 to February 2019; (2) full-time flatbed truck driver from September 2017 to November 2017; (3) full-time self-employment as a consultant from December 2013 to September 2017; (4) full-time senior subcontracts manager for a defense contractor from December 2011 to November 2013, with duty in Afghanistan; and (5) full-time self- employment as owner and operator of a franchise restaurant business from October 2001 to November 2011. The SOR concerns a history of financial problems that related to a downturn in business and eventual failure of Applicant\u2019s business. Beginning in 2001, Applicant and his spouse purchased their first franchise and over a period of years built the business to three or four separate restaurants in the local community. At its peak, the business had about 135 employees, mostly college students, and Applicant stated they had a good business with a good reputation. (Tr. 39) The business wa",

Applicant experienced a business downturn and \neventual business failure that concluded with selling the business in late 2011. The \nresulting financial problems included bankruptcy court proceedings, foreclosure of his \npersonal residence, and tax problems with state and federal tax authorities. Pursuant to \nfederal tax liens, he still owes the IRS about $66,000 for a civil penalty for multiple tax \nperiods. Although the conditions that resulted in his financial problems were largely \nbeyond his control, his tax problems with the IRS have gone on for too many years to \njustify complete mitigation. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non April 15, 2018. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 11, 2019, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \n\n \n2 \n \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 7, 2019. In a six-page memorandum, he \nlargely admitted the factual allegations and provided information in explanation and \nmitigation. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to two other judges, on July 10, 2019, and August 8, \n2019, before it was assigned to me on August 27, 2019. The hearing took place as \nscheduled on September 23, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-9. Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-J. Other than \nApplicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nOctober 2, 2019.  \n \nThe record was kept open until September 30, 2019, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to present additional documentation concerning his tax problems. Those \nmatters were timely received on September 24, 2019, and are admitted without \nobjections as Exhibit K. In addition, in a December 1, 2019 e-mail, Applicant provided \nan update on the status of his case with the IRS, which is admitted without objections as \nExhibit L.       \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance, although he has held a clearance in the past. He is employed as a contracts \nmanager for a large company in the defense industry. His annual salary is about \n$140,000, the highest it\u2019s been for some time. He has been so employed since \nFebruary 2019. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in business \nadministration. He has been married since 1984. His employment history includes: (1) \nfull-time subcontracts specialist for a defense contractor from November 2017 to \nFebruary 2019; (2) full-time flatbed truck driver from September 2017 to November \n2017; (3) full-time self-employment as a consultant from December 2013 to September \n2017; (4) full-time senior subcontracts manager  for a defense contractor from \nDecember 2011 to November 2013, with duty in Afghanistan; and (5) full-time self-\nemployment as owner and operator of a franchise restaurant business from October \n2001 to November 2011.   \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems that related to a downturn in \nbusiness and eventual failure of Applicant\u2019s business. Beginning in 2001, Applicant and \nhis spouse purchased their first franchise and over a period of years built the business \nto three or four separate restaurants in the local community. At its peak, the business \nhad about 135 employees, mostly college students, and Applicant stated they had a \ngood business with a good reputation. (Tr. 39) The business was hit hard in 2008 by the \n\n \n3 \n \nrecession and resulting downturn in discretionary spending and in the overall economy. \n(Tr. 38-40) At the time, Applicant and his spouse thought they had sufficient financing to \noperate the business for 12 to 18 months, which they thought would carry them through \na short-term, regular recession. They took remedial actions, including taking a $165,000 \nline of credit secured by their home and closed one of the restaurants. (Tr. 40) By 2009, \nit was evident that the business was struggling. (Tr. 40-41) The business had one \nrestaurant with about 45 employees at the time of sale in 2011. (Tr. 41-42)  \n \nThe franchisor found a buyer, a person already in the restaurant business, for \nApplicant, and the business was sold in December 2011. (Tr. 42, Exhibits B, G, H, and \nI) Applicant acted as the lender in the transaction, making a short-term loan of $16,000 \npayable within ten days in December 2011, and making a balloon-payment promissory \nnote for $64,000 with $1,000 monthly installments for a period of about two years during \n2012-2014, and a balloon payment due on January 1, 2014. The buyer timely paid the \nshort-term loan of $16,000, but defaulted on the promissory note, as his business failed \nand the buyer was seeking relief in bankruptcy. (Exhibit J) \n \nAfter selling the business, Applicant obtained employment as a full-time senior \nsubcontracts manager for a defense contractor. He lived and worked in Afghanistan \nfrom December 2011 to November 2013, when he elected to return due to his wife \nhaving serious health problems. He has since continued to work full-time in an effort to \nrecover from and address his financial problems, although his employment history was \na bit uneven without a steady, good-paying job like he has now.  \n \nApplicant incurred tax indebtedness with both state and federal tax authorities \nwhen his business did not make sufficient withholding and then forward the payroll \ntaxes withheld of behalf of employees. (Tr. 58-59) Such cases are often referred to as \n100% penalty assessment cases, the penalty is civil not criminal, and it is sometimes \ncalled the Civil Penalty (or \u201cCIV-PEN\u201d). In 2012, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien \nagainst Applicant\u2019s spouse in the total amount of $49,811 for six tax periods (quarters) \nduring 2009-2010. (Exhibit 3) In 2014, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien against \nApplicant\u2019s spouse in the total amount of $16,208 for three tax periods (quarters) in \n2011. (Exhibit 4) He does not owe the IRS for the most recent tax years of 2014-2018. \n(Exhibit D) The state tax authority also filed two tax liens against Applicant or his spouse \nor both in amounts of $1,935 and $1,042. \n \nApplicant was in and out of bankruptcy court during 2016-2018. (Tr. 45-50; \nExhibits 5-7) He filed two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases in 2016 and 2017, respectively, \nin an effort to reorganize his finances, pay off his creditors per a court-approved plan, \nand prevent foreclosure of his residence. In both cases, Applicant elected to have the \ncases dismissed before starting the payment plans due to circumstances at the time. By \n2018, Applicant and his spouse concluded that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was the \nbest course of action. The petition was filed in February 2018 and a discharge was \ngranted by the bankruptcy court in June 2018. They reaffirmed the debt stemming from \nthe line of credit secured by their house, but their other debts were discharged. Their \nliabilities included $72,650 in priority unsecured claims and $101,531 in nonpriority \n\n \n4 \n \nunsecured debts. (Exhibit 7) After the bankruptcy was completed, they lost the home in \nforeclosure in about October 2018. (Tr. 46-48)  \n \nApplicant stated that he has made payments to both the state and federal tax \nauthorities over the last several years. He did not present any documentation of a purely \nvoluntary payment (e.g., check, money order, etc.). In May 2019, the IRS applied \n$7,935 of Applicant\u2019s 2018 income tax refund to the tax period ending September 30, \n2009. (Exhibit K at 3). In June 2019, the state tax authority sent his 2018 state income \ntax refund of $4,035 to the IRS. (Exhibit K at 2) In September 2019, the state tax \nauthority acknowledged receipt of funds that were sufficient to pay in the full the tax \nliability, and indicated that the two state tax liens were in the process of being released. \n(Exhibit K at 4) Accordingly, I specifically find the state tax liens are paid and resolved. \n \nApplicant contacted the IRS in July 2019, which was about four months after the \nSOR was issued to him. (Exhibit C) The IRS accepted his proposal to pay the amount \nhe owes, which was $66,514 including penalty and interest, by November 7, 2019. He \nexplained at the hearing that he intended to make a lump-sum payment to resolve the \ntax indebtedness with the IRS by using proceeds from the sale of a parcel of land. \n(Exhibits E and F) The parcel of land, which is mountain property, is a five-and-a-half \nacre corner lot with a market value of about $125,000 to $150,000, and he intends to list \nit at $100,000 to promote a quick sale. (Tr. 59-60) Selling the land has been delayed \ndue to various circumstances largely beyond his control (e.g., road closure and state fire \nban) (Tr. 53-54) As a result, as of December 1, 2019, the land was unsold, and the tax \ndebt with the IRS remained unresolved, although it appears the IRS is working with him \nso he can remain current. (Exhibit K at 1 and Exhibit L). Accordingly, I specifically find \nthe federal tax liens are unpaid and not released.  \n \nApplicant described the loss of business and his home as very humbling and \nsobering events. (Tr. 74) As a result, he believes he will not make similar mistakes in \nthe future.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n\n \n5 \n \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \n                                                          \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2018 discharged a sizeable amount of unsecured debt, and the tax \nindebtedness with the state and federal tax authorities are long-standing matters. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case except for the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 19(f), because it concerns matters limited to income tax, which are not \npart of this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is certainly not the only person to experience serious financial \ndifficulties due to the so-called Great Recession, which in the United States was a \nsevere financial crisis combined with a deep recession that occurred during 2007-2009. \nEven after the recession ended, it took many years for the economy to recover to pre-\ncrisis levels. The business downturn and eventual business failure Applicant \nexperienced were clearly circumstances largely beyond his control. The same goes for \nthe health problems experienced by Applicant\u2019s spouse and Applicant\u2019s uneven \nemployment history since the business failure. Frankly, a bankruptcy to resolve the \nindebtedness connected to or associated with Applicant\u2019s business seems like a \nreasonable approach given the financial difficulties he faced. Accordingly, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part, to the three bankruptcy cases during 2016-\n2018, as they were closely connected to the business failure. I did not apply AG \u00b6 20(b) \nto the IRS tax problems for the reasons discussed below.  \n \n \nIn addressing mitigation, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to comply with tax laws \nbears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the federal government. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who fails repeatedly to \nfulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, \n2017).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s tax problems and the \ntiming of his remedial action, especially the amount owed to the IRS since it is much \nlarger than the amount owed to the state tax authority. With that said, the two state tax \nliens were for less than $2,000 each, and they are paid in full. Accordingly, those \nmatters are decided for Applicant.  \n \n \nThe IRS filed the tax liens against Applicant in 2012 and 2014, which is now \nseveral years ago. There is no documentary evidence of voluntary payments to the IRS. \nThe most recent payments to the IRS were interceptions of income tax refunds for tax \nyear 2018. Applicant\u2019s plan to make a lump-sum payment to the IRS was proposed and \nagreed to in July 2019, after he received the SOR in this case. The plan is reasonable, \nbut it has been delayed due to difficulties in getting the land ready to sell. One wonders \nwhy Applicant did not make an effort to sell the land sooner, years ago, to resolve the \nIRS matters. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is too soon to tell if \nApplicant will resolve the two federal tax liens and then continue to continue to meet his \ntax obligations on a timely basis. Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies in part because he has made an arrangement with the IRS. Nevertheless, the \nevidence is not sufficient to mitigate his long-standing and unresolved tax liens due to \nthe civil penalty. His tax problems with the IRS have gone on for too many years to \njustify complete mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d -- 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g -- 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

The $11,972 debt was cancelled by the creditor. He \nused his tax refund to reacquire another vehicle from repossession in March 2019, and he \nsettled a delinquent debt for furniture and computer back in August 2015, but other \ndelinquencies have been ignored. The financial considerations security concerns are not \nsufficiently mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn March 6, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security- \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn March 26, 2019, Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge \nfrom the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). He then submitted a detailed \nresponse to the SOR allegations on April 4, 2019. On August 19, 2019, Department \nCounsel indicated that the Government was ready to proceed to a hearing. On August 21, \n2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nOn August 28, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for September 24, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing held as scheduled, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were \nadmitted in evidence without any objections. A list of the GEs was marked as a hearing \nexhibit (HE I) for the record, but not admitted in evidence. Applicant submitted 26 \nenclosures with his Answer to the SOR, which were admitted into the record collectively at \nthe hearing as an Applicant exhibit (AE A).  Twelve additional Applicant exhibits (AEs B-M) \nwere admitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on October 4, 2019. \n \nI held the record open for three weeks after the hearing for additional evidence from \nApplicant. On October 14, 2019, Applicant submitted additional documents, which were \nadmitted in evidence without objection as AEs N-CC. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the March 6, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed delinquent debts totaling $41,684 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.q) on 17 accounts. In a detailed \nresponse, Applicant admitted the debts, but indicated that, in some cases, he did not have \nany \u201cobjective quality evidence\u201d showing that he had opened the accounts. He explained \nthat his spouse had been known to open accounts under his name and not inform him. He \ndetailed circumstances that he believes mitigate several of the delinquencies. With respect \nto some debts, he explained that before he received the SOR, he believed charged-off \ndebts or debts dropped from his credit report were \u201cno longer a concern.\u201d After considering \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and transcripts, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, married, and the father of three children, ages 16, 13, and \n12. He also has two stepchildren, ages 21 and 19. A high school graduate with an \nassociate\u2019s degree earned in 2013, he enlisted in the United States military after high \nschool in June 2000. He served honorably until he was discharged for medical reasons in \nMarch 2011. He held a top secret security clearance throughout his time in the military. He \nwas married to his first wife from September 2001 to August 2005. Since 2004 or 2005 \nApplicant has been paying child support of $152 a week for his son from his first marriage. \n(GE 1; AEs A, M; Tr. 27, 33-34.) Applicant and his current spouse wed in July 2007. (GE \n1.) They were separated from 2011 to August 2012, reconciled, and have been separated \nsince June 2019. (Tr. 29.) \n \n\n3 \n \nIn April 2011, Applicant moved for his employment as an engineering technician with \na semiconductor company. By mid-2013, his spouse was working as a vendor for a \ngreeting card company. She wanted a vehicle with functioning air conditioning. In June \n2013, they purchased a sedan, obtaining a car loan of $27,600 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), to be repaid at \n$506 per month. In July 2013, they then purchased a 2007 model-year truck, financed for \n$20,001. The amount of their monthly truck payment is not in the record. His spouse \nreduced her work hours to return to school. With the loss of spousal income and two \nvehicle payments, they began to struggle financially. They stopped paying on the car loan, \nand it was charged off for $25,797 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in May 2014. The vehicle was \nrepossessed. (GEs 1-4; AEs A, F, AA-BB.) \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s spouse had an accident in their truck, they traded it in for a new car \nin August 2015, obtaining a loan for $33,236 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Both Applicant and his spouse \nwere employed, and so they thought they could afford the $763 monthly payments on their \nnew loan while continuing to make their payments on the truck acquired only two years \nprior. They paid off the loan for the truck in October 2015, but they continued to struggle \nfinancially. Applicant attributes his financial problems at that time to a temporary loss of \nspousal income when his wife stopped working because of injury sustained in her vehicle \naccident. (GEs 3-4; AEs A, M, Z; Tr. 35, 46.) Applicant provided no details about the loss of \nspousal income or the dates of her unemployment. \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant accepted a job offer that was contingent on him \nobtaining a security clearance. (GEs 3-4; AE A.) On January 25, 2016, Applicant \ncompleted and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86). He responded affirmatively to a financial record inquiry concerning whether he had \nany voluntary or involuntary repossessions or foreclosures in the last seven years and \nlisted two vehicle repossessions: a car owned during his first marriage that was his ex-\nwife\u2019s responsibility, and the vehicle repossessed in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He indicated that \nthe deficiency balance on that loan was charged off. Applicant also answered \u201cYes\u201d to \ninquiries concerning whether he had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency in \nthe past seven years; whether he had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, \nor cancelled for failing to pay as agreed in the past seven years; and whether he had been \nover 120 days delinquent on any debt in the past seven years. He related that about 15 \naccounts totaling $5,000 in debt became negative between 2005 and 2013 while he \ntransitioned from the military to civilian life, and because he and his wife were separated \nfrom 2011 to 2012. He stated that he was paying his bills \u201cfor the most part,\u201d that his credit \nscore increased by about 30 points in the last six months, and that most if not all of the \npast-due debts had been charged off. (GE 1.) \n \nBy March 2016, several debts in Applicant\u2019s name or held jointly with his spouse had \nbeen charged off or were in collection. (GE 3.) In early April 2016, Applicant purchased a \n2009 model-year truck, taking on a vehicle loan for $12,044 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) that required \nrepayment at $460 per month. He \u201cneeded\u201d a truck capable of towing a 26-foot camper \ntrailer and a 16-foot car hauler that he already owned. He was moving and \u201cneeded the car \nhauler to move stuff with.\u201d (Tr. 41.) He was consistently two months late in his payments for \nthe truck. (GEs 3-4; AE R.) In August 2016, the job offer pending with his current employer \n\n4 \n \nwas rescinded for lack of a decision on his clearance, but he was still working for the \nsemiconductor company. (AE A.) \n \nIn late December 2016, Applicant was laid off from his full-time job with the \nsemiconductor company. He had a job lined up with his current employer in the \nsoutheastern United States, which he started in January 2017 at $50,000 per year. (Tr. 28.) \nRelocation for his new job was at his expense. He drained his bank and retirement \naccounts to cover moving expenses and deposits for housing and utilities. (AE A.) While on \nan extended temporary-duty assignment from April 2017 to February 2018, Applicant was \ninterviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \non July 3, 2017. He estimated that about 15 of his credit accounts were delinquent, and \nexplained that he had wanted to pay the debts but was unable to do so due to his \n\u201cexpanding debt-to-income ratio.\u201d He thought he could manage the payments when he \nincurred the debts, and \u201cthings began to snowball\u201d after a loss of spousal income. \nApplicant acknowledged that food and housing took priority, and he ignored some bills. He \nindicated that he and his spouse were currently living within their means because his \nspouse was working. (GE 2.)  \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant accepted a position at his current work location, which was \nmore expensive than his previous locale. They were struggling to make their $763 monthly \npayments for the sedan purchased in 2015, and they had just arranged for a voluntary \nrepossession of the vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.a), so they acquired a 2005 model-year van with a \n$2,000 down payment and a $6,966 loan, to be repaid at $301 per month. They made their \npayments for the van on time and paid off their loan in May 2019. (GE 2; AE U.) Applicant \nand his spouse no longer have the van. He testified about the van as follows: \u201cIt was \ncheaper for [his] daughter, stepdaughter [to] put a down payment on a vehicle and then we \nget the van registered and couldn\u2019t drive the van because the cop decided to take the ....\u201d \n(Tr. 43-44.) He did not elaborate further as Department Counsel redirected him to the \ndebts in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant retained the services of a law firm in the summer of 2018 to clean up his \ncredit record. He wanted to purchase the home he currently rents. Some debts were \napparently removed from his credit record, but he stopped paying the law firm for its \nservices in September or October 2018. (Tr. 34.) High water and electric utility costs in his \ncurrent area caused him some financial strain. As of late November 2018, Applicant\u2019s \ncredit score was only 486. (AE I.) In December 2018, with water and electric bills totaling \napproximately $926, he put off paying on his truck loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c) obtained in 2016 in an \neffort to catch up on his water and utility bills (AE A.) \n \nOn March 6, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant, alleging delinquent \ndebt totaling $41,684, as follows: \n \nCharged-off auto loan for $19,096 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n \nThe joint car loan obtained for $33,236 in August 2015 was $3,959 past due as of \nMay 2018 when Applicant realized that, under the loan\u2019s repayment terms, he and his \n\n5 \n \nspouse would end up paying $54,936 for a sedan with a sticker price of less than $30,000. \nAfter speaking with his security manager, he sent a letter to the creditor in early May 2018 \nindicating that he and his spouse was no longer able to make their $763 monthly \npayments. They offered to surrender the vehicle voluntarily with the understanding that \nthey would be responsible for the difference between the sale price for the car at auction \nand the balance of the loan. They offered to pay $50 a month toward the deficiency \nbalance. In June 2018, the lender repossessed the vehicle with $28,886 due ($3,997 past \ndue) on their loan. After resale, the lender charged off their account for $17,736. As of \nFebruary 2019, Applicant and his spouse owed $19,096 on the debt. Applicant thought he \nhad no further obligation to the creditor because he had paid $19,838 on the loan, and the \ncreditor gained another $11,000 to $12,000 in the auction sale. Additionally, the debt had \nbeen charged off. Applicant has made no payments on the charged-off balance as of late \nSeptember 2019, even though it continues to adversely affect his credit. (GEs 3-4; AEs A, \nS-T, Z, AA-BB; Tr. 35-40.)  \n \nCharged-off auto loan for $11,972 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n \nThe joint car loan obtained in late June 2013 for $26,700 became $1,019 past due \nin April 2014. The lender repossessed the vehicle around August 2014, and charged off \nthe account for $25,797. After the vehicle was sold, Applicant thought he and his spouse \nhad no further obligation to the creditor. In 2018, his spouse received a Notice of Debt \nCancellation (1099-C) for $11,973. They included the debt as unearned income on their \n2018 income tax return. As of January 2019, the credit bureaus were reporting the debt as \n$14,513 paid in settlement. (GEs 1-4; AEs A, Z, AA-BB; Tr. 40-41.) \n \nVehicle loan past due for $1,254 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s truck loan obtained for $12,044 in late March 2016 was $1,664 past due \nas of March 2018. He missed his loan payments in December 2018 and January 2019 \nbecause he wanted to catch up on his utility bills. As of February 2019, his loan was 60 \ndays past due for $1,290 on a $3,190 balance. In mid-March 2019, the truck was \ninvoluntarily repossessed. A week later, Applicant and his spouse received their income tax \nrefund for tax year 2018. Applicant paid $2,702 to reinstate the loan and reacquire the \ntruck. In March 2019, he paid $697 on the loan. As of April 2019, the loan balance was \n$560. They paid off the loan in May 2019 and obtained the title to the truck. (GEs 3-4; AEs \nA-B, E, G, R, AA-CC; Tr. 29, 43-45.) When Applicant and his spouse separated in June \n2019, he gave her the truck. (Tr. 29, 45.) \n \nCredit card charged off for $682 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \n \nAs of October 2018,   Equifax was reporting on Applicant\u2019s credit record that a credit \ncard had been obtained in August 2016 with a $300 credit limit. The account was charged \noff in February 2018 for $682 after nonpayment since November 2017. (GEs 3-4; AE A.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s credit report shows that the account was opened individually in her \nname. (AE Z.) Applicant does not recall opening the account, although he speculated that \nhis spouse may have opened it. As of September 2018, Trans Union was reporting that \n\n6 \n \nApplicant was an authorized user on the account. (AE AA.) At the hearing, the Government \nconceded that Applicant, as an authorized user on the account, is not legally liable for the \ndebt. (Tr. 31, 46-47.) \n \nCollection debt for $540 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report lists a credit card obtained with a catalog retailer in July \n2010 with a $379 credit limit. The account became delinquent in September 2013. In late \nMarch 2014, the creditor closed the account and wrote off a $540 balance. His spouse \nopened the credit-card account in his name, apparently without his knowledge. (Tr. 48.)  In \nJune 2019, the collection entity holding the debt offered to settle it for a lump sum of $324, \nor six monthly payments of $72, or $50 per month. (GEs 2-4; AEs A, Q, Z.) There is no \nevidence the debt has been paid. \n \nCollection debt for $278 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \nA $278 electric-utility debt from January 2017 was placed for collection in April 2018. \nAs of March 2019, the debt was unpaid. When Applicant and his family relocated in \nJanuary 2017, he had paid his current bill and was unaware that he owed a balance. He \nreceived a notice about a balance in the following months, but did not believe it was \naccurate. The account was charged off, and he believed at the time that if a debt was \ncharged off or no longer listed on his credit report, it was no longer an issue. (GE 4; AEs A, \nAA.) Applicant disputes the debt because he believes he had no outstanding obligation \nwhen he moved, although he has not contacted the creditor. (Tr. 49-50.) \n \nCollection debt for $653 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \n \nApplicant purchased a season pass to an amusement park for his family in 2014, \nopting to make monthly payments over a year\u2019s time. After six months, they had only gone \nto the park one time. He told the creditor that he wanted to cancel the pass, and the cost \nfor the next six months came due. He refused to pay the balance for which he is \ncontractually liable because he felt he had paid enough to cover his family\u2019s single visit. In \nApril 2015, a $653 past-due balance was placed for collection. (GE 3; AE A; Tr. 50-51, 56.) \nHe does not intend to pay the debt. (GE 2.) \n \nCharged-off debt for $640 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \n \n \nA credit-card account opened by Applicant in May 2010 with a $500 credit limit was \ncharged off for $640 and in collection as of April 2015. Applicant unsuccessfully disputed \nthe debt in September 2018. He told the OPM investigator that the debt was \u201ccollected.\u201d \nThe debt was still on his credit record as unpaid as of March 2019. (GEs 2-4; AE A; Tr. 51.) \nApplicant believes he settled with the creditor some time ago (AE A; Tr. 52), but he \npresented no documentary proof that it has been settled. (Tr. 52) \n\n7 \n \nCredit-card collection debt for $723 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) \n \n \nApplicant obtained a credit card in March 2010. He stopped paying on the account \nin May 2011, and a $675 debt was placed for collection. As of March 2019, the collection \nbalance was $723. In mid-March 2019, the collection entity offered to settle the debt for \n$361 payable in a lump sum by April 30, 2019; in a down payment of $72 by April 30, \n2019, and then $289 within 30 days; or in three installments of $120. (GE 3; AE A.) \nApplicant indicated during his July 2017 OPM interview that his spouse had used his credit \nfor online purchases of items for their home. (GE 2.) There is no evidence that Applicant \nhas made any payments to settle or satisfy the debt. \n \nCollection debt for $764 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) \n \n \nA wireless telephone debt of $764 was placed for collection in July 2014. Applicant \ndoes not recall opening the account, and he disputed the debt in the summer of 2018 \nthrough the law firm retained to clean up his credit report. (GE 3; AE A; Tr. 53-54.) \nApplicant believes that his spouse could have incurred the debt when they were separated, \nso sometime between 2011 and August 2012. (Tr. 53.) He presented no documentation to \ncorroborate that belief, but the debt was not on his credit record as of March 2019. (GE 4.) \n \nCollection debt for $2,603 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) \n \n \nIn December 2014, a collection entity acquired a $2,603 debt for collection. As of \nMarch 2016, the credit bureaus were reporting the debt as being owed to a \ntelecommunications company. When he answered the SOR, Applicant did not recall \nopening the account, and he indicated that he disputed the debt in the summer of 2018. \n(GE 3; AE A.) The debt was not on his credit record as of March 2019. (GE 4.) \n \nCharged-off debt for $115 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) \n \n \nA mail-order charge account in Applicant\u2019s name, which was opened in November \n2010 and apparently used by his spouse, was charged off in March 2011 for $70. As of \nOctober 2013, the balance on the debt was $115. (GE 3; AEs A, J.) There is no evidence \nof any payments to settle or satisfy the debt.  \n \nCharged-off debt for $139 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) \n \n \nA charge account opened in Applicant\u2019s name in October 2010, was charged off for \n$139. As of October 2013, the account had no activity since March 2011. (GEs 2-3; AE A.) \nThere is no evidence of any payments to settle or satisfy the debt. \n \nCharged-off debt for $139 (SOR \u00b6 1.n) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse incurred a $139 debt in his name. Applicant told the OPM \ninvestigator that the debt was incurred for magazines, and that his spouse gave his name \n\n8 \n \nfor information. As of October 2013, the account was past due $70 on a balance of $139. \n(GEs 2-3; AE A.) There is no evidence of any payments on the debt. \n \nCharged-off debt for $1,104 (SOR \u00b6 1.o) \n \n \nIn November 2010, Applicant obtained an installment loan of $4,531, to be repaid at \n$137 per month, for furniture and a computer. As of October 2014, he owed a collection \nbalance of $1,104 on the loan. In April 2015, he paid $450 to settle the debt. (GEs 2-3; \nAEs A, C; Tr. 54-55.) \n \nCollection debt for $447 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) \n \n \nA credit-card company placed a $300 debt from March 2011 for collection. As of \nDecember 2013, the collection balance was reportedly $447. He first learned about the \ndebt in October 2017. (Tr. 59-60.) Applicant told the OPM investigator that his spouse had \nused the credit card for shopping and holiday gifts. He admitted that he had stopped \nmaking payments on the account. (GEs 2-3.) There is no evidence of any payments toward \nthe delinquent balance. \n \nCollection debt for $535 (SOR \u00b6 1.q) \n \n \nA credit-card account used by Applicant for household goods referred a $300 debt \nfrom February 2011 for collection. As of January 2014, the collection balance was $535. \nApplicant surmised in response to the SOR that his spouse may have obtained credit in his \nname. However, he told the OPM investigator that he had used the account for common \nhousehold goods and that he had defaulted on his payments due to a bad debt-to-income \nratio. (GEs 2-3; AE A.) There is no evidence of any payments toward the delinquent \nbalance. \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse filed joint income tax returns for tax year 2018. According \nto their federal return, his spouse was unemployed that year. On total income of $86,839 \n($73,551 in wages, $1,315 taxable income from retirement/pension assets, and $11,973 in \ncancelled debt), they overpaid their federal income taxes by $3,157. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay from his defense contractor job is $1,717 \u2013 $1,737 every \ntwo weeks. (AE V; Tr. 62.) He receives service-connected disability income of $566 per \nmonth. (AE W.) As of March 2019, he had nine open credit cards with an aggregate \nbalance of $6,623 with scheduled repayments totaling $282 monthly. He was making \ntimely payments of $100 per month on a secured installment loan obtained for $3,174 in \nMarch 2017. As of March 2019, the balance on the loan was $2,148. Some $39,847 in \ndeferred federal student loans and $17,315 in private student loans were on his credit \nrecord. (GE 4; AEs A, AA; Tr. 66.) In August 2019, he reduced his storage expenses by \nabout $30 per month. (AE P; Tr. 82.) As of October 2019, Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses \nand debt payments totaled approximately $3,378, which included $1,310 for rent, $246 for \ncell phones, $599 for his car payment, $99 for Internet service, $220 for electricity, $132 in \nstorage space rentals, $207 in insurance for two vehicles, $29 for renter\u2019s insurance, \n\n9 \n \napproximately $330 in credit-card payments, and $100 for a vacuum. (AE Y.) Applicant \nwas persuaded by his spouse to finance the purchase of a vacuum for $1,800 that he \nestimates will end up costing $3,000. He has made payments to reduce the debts to $700. \n(Tr. 80.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has always had financial issues because something \ncomes up, such as the SOR and his marital separation, just as he begins to \u201csee the light \nat the end of the tunnel.\u201d (Tr. 27-28.) He has no savings and about $182 in his checking \naccount. (Tr. 69.)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant and his spouse separated in June 2019, she took their camper and \nmoved with her two daughters and their two children to another state. His spouse currently \nlives in the camper. (Tr. 42-43.) His stepdaughter had obtained a truck for $500 down on \nwhich she had been making $98 weekly payments with the intention of obtaining her \ndriver\u2019s license. (Tr. 83.) His spouse left him with his stepdaughter\u2019s truck, which he traded \nin the vehicle for a new car in August 2019, obtaining a loan for $28,000 to be repaid at \n$599 per month. (Tr. 64-65, 75-76.) He explained that a new vehicle was his only option \nbecause of his poor credit. With his car payment and other obligations, he has been unable \nto make payments on his delinquencies. (Tr. 29-30, 32.) He drives for ride-hailing \ncompanies for extra income to make his car payment. He sends his spouse at least $200 a \nmonth, covers the cell phone bill, and his spouse\u2019s and children\u2019s medical insurance. Since \nhis spouse left him, his electric bill has declined to about $200 a month. (Tr. 72-75.) \nApplicant owed $527 in state income taxes for tax year 2018. (Tr. 84.) He paid the debt on \nOctober 7, 2019. (AE X.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s foreman for over a year on a modernization project attests that Applicant \nwas selected to perform quality-assurance duties in addition to his daily electrical work \nbecause of his trustworthiness and ability to ensure safety was never compromised. \nApplicant\u2019s work ethic was impeccable, and the foreman indicated that he would take \nApplicant on any project that he manages. (AEs A, K.) A design-build specialist with \nApplicant\u2019s current employer, who worked with Applicant on different projects for about \neight to ten months, attests that Applicant \u201cdid everything that was asked of him and \nexpected of him.\u201d Applicant to be a team player who is well-respected by his peers. They \ncurrently work on the same project, where Applicant is doing \u201ca great job.\u201d (AEs A, L.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \n\n10 \n \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n\n11 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports of March 2016 and December 2018, and his admissions \non his SF 86, during his July 2017 interview, and in his SOR response, establish a record \nof financial delinquency triggering three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant defaulted on two vehicle loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), which have been \ncharged off. A truck financed by the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c had been repossessed before he \nused his income tax refund to pay his delinquency and reacquire the truck. Applicant \nobtained a season pass for his family to an amusement park and then defaulted on his \ncontractual liability for $653 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). When Applicant and his family relocated in \nJanuary 2017, he reportedly owed $278 for electricity services (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He claims that \nhe paid all balances owed to the utility, but he provided no evidence to show that the debt \nis invalid or has been paid. A loan obtained for $4,531 for furniture and a computer in 2010 \nwas placed for collection for $1,104 (SOR \u00b6 1.o). \n \nOf the some $3,960 in consumer credit-card delinquencies on his credit record, \nApplicant has no legal liability as an authorized user for the $682 debt (SOR \u00b61.d). \nApplicant admitted that he, or his spouse using his credit, incurred the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.h-1.i, 1.l-1.n, and 1.p-1.q, totaling $3,278. \n \nApplicant disputed through a law firm in the summer of 2018 two wireless-telephone \ndebts in collection for $764 and $2,603 since 2014, although he speculates that his spouse \ncould have incurred the $764 debt while they were separated from 2011 to 2012. Neither \ndebt appears on his more recent credit reports. While debts may be dropped from a credit \nreport when they are no longer legally collectible or for other reasons unrelated to their \nvalidity, a single listing by a collection entity on a credit report from three years ago is not \n\n12 \n \nenough to meet the Government\u2019s burden of establishing controverted allegations under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Some of the debts became seriously delinquent five \nor more years ago, such as the credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-1.n and 1.p-1.q; the car \nloan in SOR \u00b6 1.b; and the installment loan in SOR \u00b6 1.o. However, several of the debts \nhad not been resolved as of the close of the record in October 2019. The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. \n15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n  \nApplicant\u2019s finances have been negatively impacted by some circumstances outside \nof his control over the years. Applicant and his spouse were separated from 2011 to \nAugust 2012. He and his spouse defaulted on their vehicle loan obtained in June 2013 \nbecause his spouse had reduced her work hours to return to school. His spouse\u2019s accident \nin 2015 and the temporary loss of her income because she was injured in the accident \nwere unfortunate and unforeseen. Applicant was laid off in December 2016. Although he \nhad a job lined up with his current employer at an annual salary of $50,000, relocation was \nat his expense. He drained his bank and retirement accounts to cover moving expenses, \n\n13 \n \nincluding deposits for housing and utilities. In May 2018, he accepted a position in his \ncurrent locale, which has a higher cost of living than his previous area. Since his latest \nmarital separation in June 2019, Applicant has been sending his spouse at least $200 a \nmonth for her support. \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). Applicant has made some financial decisions over \nthe years, which have contributed to, if not caused, financial stress. In June 2013, he and \nhis spouse purchased a sedan, obtaining a loan of $27,600 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In July 2013, they \nthen purchased a 2007 model-year truck, financed for $20,001. With two vehicle payments, \nthey began to struggle financially. The vehicle loan obtained in June 2013 for $26,700 was \ncharged off in August 2014 for $25,797. Applicant and his spouse traded in the truck \npurchased in July 2013 for a new car in August 2015, taking on a monthly obligation for \n$763. In March 2016, Applicant took on $460 a month in loan repayment for a truck \n\u201cneeded\u201d to tow a 26-foot camper trailer and a 16-foot car hauler that he owned. He \nstruggled to make the payments on time for the truck from the start, and while he \neventually reacquired the truck after it had been repossessed, he and his spouse \nvoluntarily surrendered the 2015 model-year car because they could not afford the \npayments. Several delinquent accounts went unpaid as Applicant and his spouse were \nbuying and trading in vehicles over the years, and purchasing some items difficult to justify \ngiven their financial difficulties, including a vacuum for $1,800 that will end up costing him \nabout $3,000. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate his questionable financial decisions. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are partially established. Neither Applicant nor his spouse \nmade any effort to repay the $11,972 deficiency balance on their June 2013 vehicle loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), so AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to that debt. However, the debt is no longer \nowed. The debt was cancelled in 2018, and Applicant and his spouse reported the \ncancelled debt on their joint income tax return for tax year 2018. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the \ntruck loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which Applicant paid off in May 2019, and the installment loan \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.o, which he settled for $450 in April 2015. He has no repayment plans in \nplace for his remaining delinquencies, including the $19,096 owed on loan for the \nrepossessed 2015 model-year sedan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); the $278 electric utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f); \nthe $653 collection debt for the amusement park pass; or on the credit-card delinquencies \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h-1.i, 1.l-1.n, and 1.p-1.q). Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to \nthose debts. There is no evidence Applicant has had any financial counseling. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the $682 charged-off credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d), which is \nhis spouse\u2019s responsibility. Applicant was only an authorized user on the account. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) also applies to the alleged wireless telephone debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k because \nthe evidence falls short of establishing that they are valid debts for which Applicant bears \nsome legal liability. As for those debts incurred by Applicant\u2019s spouse using his credit, \n\n14 \n \nApplicant has not disproven his responsibility for repayment. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to \nthose debts. \n  \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that he has \npaid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Yet, the Appeal Board recently \nreiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must \ndemonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, \nconduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant has not \ndemonstrated a track record of timely payments on several of his delinquencies. Even \nassuming that he believed he had no further obligation on those debts that had been \ncharged off, he would have had reason to question that belief once he received the SOR in \nMarch 2019. He was offered settlement terms by one creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in March 2019, \nand there is no evidence that he made any payments to settle that debt. He has made no \nprogress toward resolving the $19,096 car-loan deficiency, or the $278 electric utility debt, \neven though they are still on his credit report. Applicant demonstrated some financial \nresponsibility by budgeting for his expenses, lowering his monthly storage fees by $30 in \nAugust 2019, and paying his income tax debt for 2018 in October 2019. He has been \nearning extra money to ensure that he can make his $599 monthly car payment. However, \nhe has little to no cash assets (savings and checking deposits) to cover any unexpected \nexpense, even with his service-connected disability income. He appears to have no \nintention to repay the past-due balances for the car loan, amusement park pass, or those \ncredit-card debts incurred by his spouse in his name. Concerns about his financial situation \nand his judgment persist. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline F, but \nsome warrant additional comment. For the most part, Applicant has been consistently \nemployed. He and his spouse together or individually incurred substantial debt beyond \ntheir ability to repay on their household income from employment and Applicant\u2019s disability \nincome. \n \n\n15 \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended as punishment for past specific \nconduct. The security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, and \nother characteristics essential to protecting national security information. Applicant \npresented positive character references from two co-workers attesting to his excellent work \nperformance and dedication. Yet, is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an \napplicant\u2019s security-clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nrenewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). Applicant\u2019s ongoing disregard of some known delinquencies is inconsistent with the \ngood judgment required to hold a security clearance. After applying the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p-1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 24, 2016. \nOn March 20, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 20, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6, on July 11, \n2019. On July 15, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal \n\n2 \n \nletter and a complete copy of the FORM were sent to Applicant. Applicant\u2019s receipt is \ndated August 1, 2019. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 \ndays after his receipt to submit information. Applicant did not file a response. The DOHA \ntransmittal letter and receipt are marked as Administrative Exhibit 1. The case was \nassigned to me on October 22, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old mechanic employed by a federal contractor since \nNovember 2015. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from \nNovember 2004 until December 2013. He completed a three-month project management \nprogram in December 2014. He married in January 2006 and divorced in December 2012. \nHe previously held a security clearance while on active duty. (GX 1.)  \n \nThe SOR alleges three debts totaling $33,679. The debts are comprised of a \n$15,711 charged-off personal loan, a $9,875 a charged-off credit card, and an $8,093 \nbalance due on a vehicle-loan after repossession. Applicant admits each of the \nallegations. The delinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s December 2018 and \nNovember 2016 credit bureau reports (CBR) (GX 6; GX 5), and discussed in his personal \nsubject interview (PSI) summary (GX 4) and e-QIP (GX 3). Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nAfter leaving active duty, Applicant was unemployed from December 2013 until \nJanuary 2014. In January 2014, Applicant began working as an operator for a \nmanufacturing company. At some point between January and May 2014, he was \ndiagnosed with testicular cancer and began undergoing treatments. He was physically \nunable to continue working. In May 2014, he moved to another state with his fianc\u00e9e with \nthe intention of continuing to recover then finding work and enrolling in school. He was \nunemployed from May 2014 until January 2015. Applicant worked as a technician for an \naerospace company from January 2015 until September 2015, when he moved to be \ncloser to his family. He was unemployed from September 2015 until November 2015, \nwhen he began working for his current employer.  \n \nDue to his inability to work while undergoing cancer treatments, and the lasting \nimpact of his periods of unemployment between 2013 and 2015, Applicant was unable to \nsustain his financial obligations. His vehicle was repossessed in November 2014 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), and his house was foreclosed upon in February 2015. His credit card became \ndelinquent in March 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and he defaulted on his personal loan in September \n2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant incurred an additional $4,626 debt that went to collection in \nMay 2014, but that debt has since been repaid through garnishment. (GX 5; GX 1.) \nApplicant attempted to consolidate his debts, but was unable to do so. (GX 4.) The SOR \ndebts remain outstanding. \n \nApplicant\u2019s CBRs show a credit history dating back to 2007, that includes paid off \npersonal loans, vehicle loans, credit cards, and a line of credit. Applicant has not incurred \nany other delinquent accounts since 2014. He is current on all his open accounts. (GX 6.)  \n\n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n4 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information\u2026. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  AG \u00b6 19(a): an inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nThe conditions that caused Applicant to become delinquent on his financial \nobligations arose under unique circumstances which were largely beyond his control. \n\n5 \n \nSpecifically, Applicant\u2019s financial issues are the result of a medical crisis that he \nexperienced in 2014 that led to an eight-month period of unemployment. Applicant also \nexperienced other periods of unemployment between 2013 and 2015 that if affected his \noverall ability to address these delinquent accounts. However, Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nDespite his financial strains, Applicant has managed to live within his means \nwithout incurring any additional debts. With the exception of the debts he incurred in 2014, \nApplicant has a long-standing sound financial record, which includes consistent \nrepayment of personal loans, credit cards, and vehicle loans. He repaid a $4,626 debt \nthrough garnishment. He attempted to consolidate the SOR debts, but was unable to do \nso. His credit reports are indicative of someone who is currently financially stable and \nlives within his means. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts did not arise from lack of self-control, \nirresponsibility, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, and do not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances.  I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant served honorably on active duty in the Marine Corps for nine years. He \nhas a strong credit history and is currently financially stable and fiscally responsible.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by his financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",
